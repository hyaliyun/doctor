We investigated the diagnostic and therapeutic status of breast malignancy before and after the COVID-19 pandemic at the multi-institution level. Methods: We have reviewed the records of patients with breast cancer from February 2019 to July 2020 in six university hospitals in Korea. The patients were divided into two groups according to the initial date of cancer diagnosis: Period A, from February to April and Period B, from May to July in 2020. The two groups were compared for the same periods in 2019. The goals were to determine whether breast cancer screening and diagnosis have been delayed and thus resulted in stage migration. We also examined the difference in the number of surgeries in patients diagnosed with breast cancer during those periods. Results: The total of 1,669 breast malignancy diagnosis was made in the grouped periods of 2019, and 1,369 diagnoses in 2020. All patients were screened by PCR test for COVID-19 prior to hospitalization, and none of them tested positive. Overall, there was a 9.9% reduction in the number of diagnoses than in 2019 and the decrease was more significant in Period A (11.1% vs. 8.7%). According to the age, there was no difference until the 30s but decreased from those in their 40s and above. The decline was more pronounced in the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected breast cancer screening (decreased by 27.4%) and more diminished in Period A (41.0% vs. 19.0%). Invasive breast cancer stage was not statistically different in Period A compare with 2019 (p = 0.170). But the stage in Period B was different (p = 0.032), and more patients were observed in advanced stages in 2020. The decrease in surgery was noticeably observed in Period A (4.6%, from 480 to 438 surgeries) and not in Period B. The analysis of reconstruction surgery was similar. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 increased exponentially from late February in Korea. However, the number of patients per day decreased to less than 100 on March 15 and then flattened. The health care system for cancer was not overloaded and restrictions on visiting hospital were minimal. Analysis in the pandemic period of the 6-month showed that the number of breast cancer screening, diagnosis and surgeries decreased compared with the previous year. Those decreases were prominent in Period A when the COVID-19 patient surged. The upstage migration of breast cancer was generally insignificant but slightly occurred in Period B. The outbreak of infectious disease makes patients reluctant to come to the hospital, especially in the elderly. We need to discuss the potential long-lasting deleterious effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer diagnosis and management. And we should prepare for how to deal with the backlog caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 on the diagnosis and management of breast cancer in Korea: A multi-institutional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Work-related stress, anxiety and depression (WRSAD) are common, overlapping mental health problems burdened with major medical, occupational, institutional and societal implications. Current occupational health (OH) management of WRSAD is based on clinical and managerial guidelines and individual risk assessment. AIMS: The study sought to identify patterns of OH advice in WRSAD and the relationships between the OH advice, available evidence, experience and expertise of the OH doctors (OHDs). METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 101 first-time OH consultations for WRSAD by nine OHDs. RESULTS: The three most common OH interventions included follow-up OH consultations, adjusted duties and referrals for counselling. All OHDs preferred a light-touch approach but the less experienced and qualified OHDs were more proactive and prescriptive. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a specific occupational medical guideline for the management of WRSAD, the OH interventions may be guided by clinical guidelines, individual risk assessment, the clients circumstances or the experience, expertise and preferences of the OHDs. In the study group, OH interventions were under-utilized and not consistently applied. Our findings support the argument for OH guideline for WRSAD to improve the consistency and effectiveness of OH interventions.

Several studies to characterize the new virus expressing G614 variant show that it exhibits increased infectivity compared to the ancestral virus having D614 spike protein. Here, using in-silico mutagenesis and energy calculations, we analyzed inter-residue interaction energies and thermodynamic stability of the dominant (G614) and the ancestral (D614) variants of spike protein trimer in closed and partially open conformations. We find that the local interactions mediated by aspartate at the 614th position are energetically frustrated and create unfavourable environment. Whereas, glycine at the same position confers energetically favourable environment and strengthens intra-as well as inter-protomer association. Such changes in the local interaction energies enhance the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein trimer as free energy difference (G) upon glycine substitution is ?2.6 kcal/mol for closed conformation and ?2.0 kcal/mol for open conformation. Our results on the structural and energetic basis of enhanced stability hint that G614 may confer increased availability of functional form of spike protein trimer and consequent in higher infectivity than the D614 variant.","output":"D614G substitution enhances the stability of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Altered coagulation and alveolar injury are the hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, whether the biomarkers that reflect pathophysiology differ depending on the etiology of ARDS has not been examined. This study aimed to investigate the biomarker profiles of coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury in two subtypes of ARDS: patients with direct common risk factors (dARDS) and those with idiopathic or immune-related diseases (iARDS), which are classified as ARDS without common risk factors based on the Berlin definition. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a university hospital with a diagnosis of ARDS with no indirect risk factors. Plasma biomarkers (thrombinCantithrombin complex [TAT], plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]-1, protein C [PC] activity, procalcitonin [PCT], surfactant protein [SP]-D, and KL-6) were routinely measured during the first 5 days of the patients ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 138 eligible patients with ARDS, 51 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria (n = 41) or other causes of ARDS (n = 10). Of the remaining 87 patients, 56 were identified as having dARDS and 31 as having iARDS. Among the iARDS patients, TAT (marker of thrombin generation) and PAI-1 (marker of inhibited fibrinolysis) were increased, and PC activity was above normal. In contrast, PC activity was significantly decreased, and TAT or PAI-1 was present at much higher levels in dARDS compared with iARDS patients. Significant differences were also observed in PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 between patients with dARDS and iARDS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that areas under the ROC curve for PC activity, PAI-1, PCT, SP-D, and KL-6 were similarly high for distinguishing between dARDS and iARDS (PC 0.86, P = 0.33; PAI-1 0.89, P = 0.95; PCT 0.89, P = 0.66; and SP-D 0.88, P = 0.16 vs. KL-6 0.90, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and alveolar epithelial injury were observed in both patients with dARDS and with iARDS. However, their biomarker profiles were significantly different between the two groups.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Americas, and hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor. However, hypertension control rates remain low, and CVD mortality is stagnant or rising after decades of continuing reduction. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the HEARTS technical package to improve hypertension control. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) designed the HEARTS in the Americas Initiative to improve CVD risk management, emphasizing hypertension control, to date implemented in 21 countries. METHODS. To advance implementation, an interdisciplinary group of practitioners was engaged to select the key evidence-based drivers of hypertension control and to design a comprehensive scorecard to monitor their implementation at primary care health facilities (PHC). The group studied high-performing health systems that achieve high hypertension control through quality improvement programs focusing on specific process measures, with regular feedback to providers at health facilities. FINDINGS. The final selected eight drivers were categorized into five main domains: (1) diagnosis (blood pressure measurement accuracy and CVD risk evaluation); (2) treatment (standardized treatment protocol and treatment intensification); (3) continuity of care and follow-up; (4) delivery system (team-based care, medication refill), and (5) system for performance evaluation. The drivers and recommendations were then translated into process measures, resulting in two interconnected scorecards integrated into the HEARTS in the Americas monitoring and evaluation system. INTERPRETATION. Focus on these key hypertension drivers and resulting scorecards, will guide the quality improvement process to achieve population control goals at the participating health centers in HEARTS implementing countries.","output":"Factores impulsores y mtodos de puntuacin para mejorar el control de la hipertensin en la prctica clnica de la atencin primaria: recomendaciones del grupo de innovacin de HEARTS en las Amricas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, with considerable public health and socio-economic impacts that are seriously affecting health and safety of workers, as well as their employment stability.

The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering.

It may help to devise better artemisinin enhancement strategies, so that its production becomes cost effective and becomes available to masses. ABSTRACT: Malaria is a major threat to world population, particularly in South-East Asia and Africa, due to dearth of effective anti-malarial compounds, emergence of quinine resistant malarial strains, and lack of advanced healthcare facilities. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone obtained from Artemisia annua L., is the most potent drug against malaria and used in the formulation of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Artemisinin is also effective against various types of cancers, many other microbes including viruses, parasites and bacteria. However, this specialty metabolite and its derivatives generally occur in low amounts in the source plant leading to its production scarcity. Considering the importance of this drug, researchers have been working worldwide to develop novel strategies to augment its production both in vivo and in vitro. Due to complex chemical structure, its chemical synthesis is quite expensive, so researchers need to devise synthetic protocols that are economically viable and also work on increasing the in-planta production of artemisinin by using various strategies like use of phytohormones, stress signals, bioinoculants, breeding and transgenic approaches. The focus of this review is to discuss these artemisinin enhancement strategies, understand mechanisms modulating its biosynthesis, and evaluate if roots play any role in artemisinin production. Furthermore, we also have a critical analysis of various assays used for artemisinin measurement. This may help to develop better artemisinin enhancement strategies which lead to decreased price of ACTs and increased profit to farmers.","output":"Enhancing artemisinin content in and delivery from Artemisia annua: a review of alternative, classical, and transgenic approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The topic of digital inclusion and web accessibility for People with Cognitive Disabilities has increased over the COVID-19 pandemic times.

The results showed that sensitivity was positively, though weakly, correlated with COVID-19 stress and negatively correlated with resilience. Resilience was negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress. Mediation analysis showed that resilience buffered the negative relationship between sensitivity and COVID-19 stress, and its indirect effect was statistically significant, albeit close to zero.

Data were collected from 170 patients with a median age of 2 months. No patient presented cardiorespiratory arrest nor any other complication during the use of NIV. The success rate for the use of NIV was 61.8%. Subjects were divided for analysis into successful and failed NIV groups. Statistical analysis used Chi-square, MannCWhitney, and Students t tests, which were performed after univariate and multivariate logistic regression for p < 0.05. In the multivariate analysis, only the minimal pressure gradient (OR 1.45 with p = 0.007), maximum oxygen saturation (OR 0.88 with p = 0.011), and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (OR 1.16 with p < 0.001) influenced NIV failure.

KSHV, an etiologic agent of Kaposis sarcoma (KS), displays primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). Many therapeutics, such as bortezomib, CHOP cocktail medications, and natural compounds (e.g., quercetin or curcumin), are administrated to patients affected by -herpesvirus infections.

METHODS We conducted a case-matched retrospective review of 20 patients who underwent single-site laparoscopic procedures for inflammatory bowel disease compared with 20 matched patients undergoing multiport laparoscopic procedures. Data regarding these patients were tabulated in the following categories: demographic characteristics, operative parameters, and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS A wide range of cases were completed: 9 ileocolic resections, 7 cases of proctocolectomy with end ileostomy or ileal pouch anal anastomosis, 2 cases of proctectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and 2 total abdominal colectomies with end ileostomy were all matched to equivalent multiport laparoscopic cases. No single-incision cases were converted to multiport laparoscopy, and 2 single-incision cases (10%) were converted to an open approach. For single-incision cases, the mean length of stay was 7.7 days, the mean time to oral intake was 3.3 days, and the mean period of intravenous analgesic use was 5.0 days. There were no statistically significant differences between single-site and multiport cases. CONCLUSIONS Single-site laparoscopic surgery is technically feasible in inflammatory bowel disease. The length of stay and period of intravenous analgesic use (in days) appear to be higher than those in comparable series examining outcomes of single-site laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and the outcomes are comparable with those of multiport laparoscopy.

However, large-scale proteomics have led to a massive identification of proteins translated from mRNAs of alternative ORF (AltORFs), in addition to the predicted proteins issued from the reference ORF or from ncRNAs. These alternative proteins (AltProts) are not represented in the conventional protein databases and this ghost proteome was not considered until recently. Some of these proteins are functional and there is growing evidence that they are involved in central functions in physiological and physiopathological context. Based on our experience with AltProts, we were interested in finding out their interaction with the viral protein coming from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, we have scrutinized the recently published data by Krogan and coworkers (2020) on the SARS-CoV-2 interactome with host cells by affinity purification in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) in the perspective of drug repurposing. The initial work revealed the interaction between 332 human cellular reference proteins (RefProts) with the 27 viral proteins. Re-interrogation of this data using 23 viral targets and including AltProts, followed by enrichment of the interaction networks, leads to identify 218 RefProts (in common to initial study), plus 56 AltProts involved in 93 interactions. This demonstrates the necessity to take into account the ghost proteome for discovering new therapeutic targets, and establish new therapeutic strategies.

Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes. The interpretation for this finding is discussed in relation to function and potency of the astrocytes, and variations and anomalies of nervous ontogeny.","output":"Ultrastructural study of myelinating cells and sub-pial astrocytes in developing rat spinal cord()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing from December 2019. As of December 14, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 73 million confirmed infections and above 1.5 million reported deaths worldwide. During this period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control strategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and the control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the situation is still alarming. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ([Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]) is already present. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID-19 cases is well captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are available, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases.","output":"Short-term predictions and prevention strategies for COVID-19: A model-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adjuvanted soluble protein vaccines have been used extensively in humans for protection against various viral infections based on their robust induction of antibody responses. Here, soluble prefusion-stabilized spike trimers (preS dTM) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were formulated with the adjuvant AS03 and administered twice to nonhuman primates (NHP). Binding and functional neutralization assays and systems serology revealed that NHP developed AS03-dependent multi-functional humoral responses that targeted multiple spike domains and bound to a variety of antibody F(C) receptors mediating effector functions in vitro. Pseudovirus and live virus neutralizing IC(50) titers were on average greater than 1000 and significantly higher than a panel of human convalescent sera. NHP were challenged intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose (310(6) PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate). Two days post-challenge, vaccinated NHP showed rapid control of viral replication in both the upper and lower airways. Notably, vaccinated NHP also had increased spike-specific IgG antibody responses in the lung as early as 2 days post challenge. Moreover, vaccine-induced IgG mediated protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge following passive transfer to hamsters. These data show that antibodies induced by the AS03-adjuvanted preS dTM vaccine are sufficient to mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 and support the evaluation of this vaccine in human clinical trials.","output":"Vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and AS03 Adjuvant Induces Rapid Anamnestic Antibodies in the Lung and Protects Against Virus Challenge in Nonhuman Primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation contributes to neuroinflammation in autoimmune disorders, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that compared with wild-type (WT) mice, mice lacking thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor (TSLPR) (Tslpr(?/?) mice) exhibit a significantly decreased experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) score, reduced CD4(+) T cell infiltration, and restored myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the brain after EAE induction by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein(35C55) (MOG(35C55)). TSLPR signals through Janus kinase (JAK)2, but not JAK1 or JAK3, to induce NLRP3 expression, and Tslpr(?/?) mice with EAE show decreased JAK2 phosphorylation and NLRP3 expression in the brain. JAK2 inhibition by ruxolitinib mimicked loss of TSLPR function in vivo and further decreased TSLP expression in the EAE mouse brain. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 decreased CD4(+) T cell infiltration, restored MBP expression, and decreased IL-1 and TSLP levels, verifying the pro-inflammatory role of NLRP3. In vitro experiments using BV-2 murine microglia revealed that TSLP directly induced NLRP3 expression, phosphorylation of JAK2 but not JAK1orJAK3, and IL-1 release, which were markedly inhibited by ruxolitinib. Furthermore, EAE induction led to an increase in the Th17 cell number, a decrease in the regulatory T (Treg) cell number in the blood, and an increase in the expression of the cytokine IL-17A in the WT mouse brain, which was drastically reversed in Tslpr(?/?) mice. In addition, ruxolitinib suppressed the increase in IL-17A expression in the EAE mouse brain.

With severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as its etiologic agent, severe COVID-19 cases usually develop uncontrolled inflammatory responses and cytokine storm-like syndromes. Measuring serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and others) as inflammatory biomarkers may have several potential applications in the management of COVID-19, including risk assessment, monitoring of disease progression, determination of prognosis, selection of therapy and prediction of response to treatment. This is especially true for pediatric patients with COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like disease and similar syndromes. In this report, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 associated cytokines, their roles in host immune and inflammatory responses, the clinical significance and utility of cytokine immunoassays in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients, as well as the challenges and pitfalls in implementation and interpretation of cytokine immunoassays. Given that cytokines are implicated in different immunological disorders and diseases, it is challenging to interpret the multiplex cytokine data for COVID-19 patients. Also, it should be taken into consideration that biological and technical variables may affect the commutability of cytokine immunoassays and enhance complexity of cytokine immunoassay interpretation. It is recommended that the same method, platform and laboratory should be used when monitoring differences in cytokine levels between groups of individuals or for the same individual over time. It may be important to correlate cytokine profiling data with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing and imaging observations to make an accurate interpretation of the inflammatory status and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Clinical significance of measuring serum cytokine levels as inflammatory biomarkers in adult and pediatric COVID-19 cases: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acidogenic fermentation is attractive for food waste valorisation. A better understanding is required on how operation affects product selectivity. This study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) selected fermentation pathways in a single-stage, semi-continuous stirred tank reactor. Three combinations of HRT and OLR were tested to distinguish the effect of each parameter. Three fermentation profiles with distinct microbial communities were obtained. Predominantly n-butyric acid (13  2 gCOD L-1, 55  14% of carboxylates) was produced at an HRT of 8.5 days and OLR around 12 gCOD L-1d-1. Operating at an HRT two days longer, yet with similar OLR, stimulated chain elongation (up to 13.6 gCOD L-1 of n-caproic acid). This was reflected by a microbial community twice as diverse at longer HRT as indicated by first and second order Hill number (1D = 24  4, 2D = 12  3) and by a higher relative abundance of genera related to secondary fermentation, such as the VFA-elongating Caproiciproducens spp., and secondary lactic acid fermenter Secundilactobacillus spp..

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from October 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 from currently working, nationally certified EMS personnel (n = 15,339), assessing N95 respirator fit testing; training in air purified respirators (APR) or powered APR (PAPR) use; and training on PPE use for chemical, biological, and nuclear (CBN) threats. We used an interrupted time series analysis to determine changes in proportions of EMS personnel reporting training per week, using the date of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) initial EMS guidance (February 6, 2020) as the interruption. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to understand factors associated with each outcome. Results: We found high awareness of N95 respirators (99%) and APR/PAPR (91%), but only 61% reported N95 fit testing and 64% reported training on PPE for CBN threats in the prior 12 months. There was a significant, positive slope change after CDC guidance for N95 respirator fit testing, and significant post-interruption mean increases for fit testing (0.9%, 95% CI 0.6-1.1%), APR/PAPR training (0.3%, 95% CI 0.2-0.5%), and PPE for CBN threats training (0.6%, 95% CI 0.3-0.9%). Factors consistently associated with lower odds of awareness/training included part-time employment, providing 9-1-1 response service, working at a non-fire-based EMS agency, and working in a rural setting. Conclusions: CDC guidance on COVID-19 for EMS may have increased N95 fit testing and training, but there remain substantial gaps in training on PPE use among EMS personnel.

Data were collected from March 18 until April 19, 2020, which corresponds to the spring lockdown and the first peak of the pandemic in Belgium.

It is well established that heparanase, the endothelial glycocalyx degrading enzyme, plays a major role in various diseases with vascular leakage. It is yet to be elucidated whether heparanase activity plays a major role in dengue-associated plasma leakage. Moreover, the major source of heparanase secretion and activation in dengue remains elusive. Since a relatively high amount of heparanase is stored in platelets, we postulate that heparanase released by activated platelets contributes to the increased plasma heparanase activity during dengue virus infection. METHODS: Heparanase activity (plasma and urine), and heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 (plasma levels) were measured in dengue patients with thrombocytopenia in acute phase (n=30), during course of disease (n=10) and in convalescent phase (n=25). Associations with clinical parameters and plasma leakage markers were explored. Platelets from healthy donors were stimulated with dengue non-structural protein-1, DENV2 virus and thrombin to evaluate heparanase release and activity ex vivo. RESULTS: Heparanase activity was elevated in acute dengue and normalized during convalescence. Similarly, glycocalyx components, such as heparan sulfate and syndecan-1, were increased in acute dengue and restored during convalescence. Increased heparanase activity correlated with the endothelial dysfunction markers heparan sulfate and syndecan-1, as well as clinical markers of plasma leakage such as ascites, hematocrit concentration and gall-bladder wall thickening. Notably, platelet number inversely correlated with heparanase activity. Ex vivo incubation of platelets with thrombin and live DENV2 virus, but not dengue virus-2-derived non-structural protein 1 induced heparanase release from platelets. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings suggest that the increase of heparanase activity in dengue patients is associated with endothelial glycocalyx degradation and plasma leakage. Furthermore, thrombin or DENV2 activated platelets may be considered as a potential source of heparanase.","output":"Increased Plasma Heparanase Activity and Endothelial Glycocalyx Degradation in Dengue Patients Is Associated With Plasma Leakage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Free-roaming dogs are a worldwide problem that cause a wide array of issues in society. In Chile, a law protecting companion animals, and describing the role of responsible owners, was promulgated in 2017, followed by a national program aimed at mitigating dog-related problems throughout the country. The aim of this review is to explain and discuss certain components of the program and to provide suggestions for future changes. A simple model was created to assist managers in Chilean municipalities to more closely estimate the local dog population. The recommendations include the collection of baseline data and a dog population size estimate prior to implementing interventions, as well as the development of clear objectives, achievable goals and indicators, and the investment of public funds in long-term sustainable strategies such as education and enforcement rather than offering free veterinary services. ABSTRACT: Free-roaming dogs are a worldwide problem, with Chile having some of the highest human-to-dog ratios in the world. In 2017, Law 21.020 was promulgated and the federal government developed a national responsible pet ownership program. The objectives of this article are to describe and discuss the dog-related components of the program, to design a tool for determining human-to-dog ratios in Chile, and to make recommendations to managers to improve the program outcomes. The overarching goal of the program was to mitigate the conflict between humans and dogs, but many of the interventions were animal-focused and the indicators did not consider the perception of the Chilean public. Using human density data and known dog populations, we found that as the human density increased, there were fewer dogs per person. Veterinary services and sterilizations were the mainstay of the program and were offered for free to citizens. Education was offered to all ages through public events, as well as municipality and organization activities. The identification of dogs was obligatory for dog owners. Enforcement was not included in the program. The recommendations are to conduct preintervention baseline data collections and to tailor interventions and indicators appropriately; to use dog population size estimates determined at the local level rather than a country-wide estimate; to replace free veterinary services with low-cost sterilization campaigns; to create sustainable plans for education; and to create enforcement teams in communities.","output":"A Review and Analysis of the National Dog Population Management Program in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in profound health challenges across the globe.

Main outcome measure Community pharmacists perceptions on safety, resilience, organizational support, and pharmaceutical services offered during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 217 pharmacists participated in the study. The vast majority of community pharmacists reported a positive outlook and were able to balance working with self-care during this period. Most reported to have access to personal protective equipment such as gloves and hand sanitizers. A large proportion of community pharmacies also installed physical barriers in doorways or in front of the counter, put markings on the ground to section areas to ensure physical distancing, and controlled the number of customers who could access the pharmacy during this period. Innovations reported to be implemented included teleconsultations and providing curb-side or drive-through delivery and pickup services. Conclusion: The findings suggest the frontline and essential roles of community pharmacists in delivering pandemic responses, creating the opportunity to determine areas where community pharmacy services can be incorporated to strengthen the public health system and improve patient health outcomes.","output":"The coping strategies of community pharmacists and pharmaceutical services provided during COVID-19 in Malaysia (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) colonizes the lungs, leading to chronic inflammation of the bronchial epithelium. ChaC glutathione-specific -glutamylcyclotransferase 1 (CHAC1) mRNA is differentially expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECBs) from patients with CF and healthy patients at baseline and upon infection with Pa. CHAC1 degrades glutathione and is associated with ER stress and apoptosis pathways. In this study, we examined the roles of CHAC1 in the inflammatory response and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. First, we confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction that CHAC1 mRNA was overexpressed in hAECBs from patients without CF compared with the expression in hAECBs from patients with CF upon Pa (PAK strain) infection. Moreover, the Pa virulence factors LPS and flagellin were shown to induce CHAC1 expression in cells from patients without CF. Using NCI-H292 lung epithelial cells, we found that LPS-induced CHAC1 mRNA expression was PERK-independent and involved ATF4. Additionally, using CHAC1 small interfering RNA, we showed that reduced CHAC1 expression in the context of LPS and flagellin stimulation was associated with modulation of inflammatory markers and alteration of NF-B signaling. Finally, we showed that Pa was not able to induce apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. Our results suggest that CHAC1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation in bronchial cells during Pa infection and may explain the excessive inflammation present in the respiratory tracts of patients with CF.","output":"CHAC1 Is Differentially Expressed in Normal and Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Regulates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex environmental, economic, and social conditions in the places we live provide strong cues to our longevity, livelihood, and well-being. Although often distinct and evolving relatively independently, health disparity, social vulnerability and environmental justice research and practice intertwine and inform one another. Together, they increasingly provide evidence of how social processes intensify disasters almost predictably giving rise to inequitable disruptions and consequences. The domino and cumulative effects of cascading disasters invariably reveal inequities through differential impacts and recovery opportunities across communities and subgroups of people. Not only do cascading disasters reveal and produce inequitable effects, the cascade itself can emerge out of compounded nested social structures. Drawing on, and integrating, theory and practice from social vulnerability, health inequity, and environmental justice, this paper presents a comprehensive conceptual model of cascading disasters that offers a people-centric lens. The CHASMS conceptual model (Cascading Hazards to disAsters that are Socially constructed eMerging out of Social Vulnerability) interrogates the tension between local communities and the larger structural forces that produce social inequities at multiple levels, capturing how those inequities lead to cascading disasters. We apply the model to COVID-19 as an illustration of how underlying inequities give rise to foreseeable inequitable outcomes, emphasizing the U.S. experience. We offer Kenya and Puerto Rico as examples of cumulative effects and possible cascades when responding to other events in the shadow of COVID-19. COVID-19 has vividly exposed the dynamic, complex, and intense relevance of placing social conditions and structures at the forefront of cascading disaster inquiry and practice. The intensity of social disruption and the continuation of the pandemic will, no doubt, perpetuate and magnify chasms of injustice.","output":"The CHASMS Conceptual Model of Cascading Disasters and Social Vulnerability: the COVID-19 Case Example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health departments have issued guidelines to limit viral transmission. In this environment, people will feel urges to engage in activities that violate these guidelines, but research on guideline adherence has been reliant on surveys asking people to self-report their typical behaviour, which may fail to capture these urges as they unfold. Guideline adherence could be improved through behaviour change interventions, but considering the wide range of behaviours that COVID-19 guidelines prescribe, few methods allow observing changes of aggregate guideline adherence in the wild. Methods To administer interventions and to obtain contemporaneous data on a wide range of behaviours, we use ecological momentary assessment. In this preregistered parallel randomised trial, 95 participants aged 18-65 from the UK were assigned to three conditions using blinded block randomisation, and engage in episodic future thinking (n = 33), compassion exercises (n = 31), or a sham procedure (n = 31) and report regularly on the intensity of their occurrent urges (min. 1, max. 10) and their ability to control them. We investigate whether state impulsivity and vaccine attitudes predict guideline adherence while assessing through which mechanism these predictors affect behaviour. Results We found that episodic future thinking (b = -1.60) and compassion exercises (b = -1.40) reduce the intensity of urges. State impulsivity is associated with stronger urges, but we found no evidence that vaccine hesitancy predicts lesser self-control. Conclusions We conclude that episodic future thinking exercises and compassion training may be used to stimulate compliance of individuals who are a risk for the community, such as those in voluntary self-isolation.","output":"Episodic future thinking and compassion reduce public health guideline noncompliance urges: A randomised controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and created challenges in various subspecialty training programs, including hematology/oncology fellowship programs.

Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenons complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes. Our results show that there are significant fluctuations in traffic flow even during rush hours, and thus cities would benefit from implementing adaptive reversible lanes.","output":"Modeling adaptive reversible lanes: A cellular automata approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, known as favism, is classically manifested by hemolytic anemia in human. More recently, it has been shown that mild G6PD deficiency moderately affects cardiac function, whereas severe G6PD deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice. How G6PD deficiency affects organisms has not been fully elucidated due to the lack of a suitable animal model. In this study, G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans was established by RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to delineate the role of G6PD in animal physiology. Upon G6PD RNAi knockdown, G6PD activity was significantly hampered in C. elegans in parallel with increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Phenotypically, G6PD-knockdown enhanced germ cell apoptosis (2-fold increase), reduced egg production (65% of mock), and hatching (10% of mock). To determine whether oxidative stress is associated with G6PD knockdown-induced reproduction defects, C. elegans was challenged with a short-term hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The early phase egg production of both mock and G6PD-knockdown C. elegans were significantly affected by H(2)O(2). However, H(2)O(2)-induced germ cell apoptosis was more dramatic in mock than that in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in defective oogenesis and embryogenesis caused by G6PD knockdown, mutants of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3- and 9.6-fold increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C. elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.","output":"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency enhances germ cell apoptosis and causes defective embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Key and colleagues raise some serious criticisms related to the marketing disciplines purpose drift and short-sighted approach to rigor and relevance.

It must be offered in conjunction with standard treatment for any disease that threatens the continuation of life, such as a Covid-19 infection. DISCUSSION: The bioethical principles and strategies used by palliative medicine can assist nephrologists in the care of patients with renal dysfunction, who face the difficulties of isolation at the beginning and follow-up of dialysis in outpatient treatment, and those who are at risk for a more serious disease progress. Some of them: - a Shared decision making, which enables the patient and family to participate as facilitators in the systematization of the teams reasoning, in addition to respecting the principle of autonomy; - Symptom Management: which should be a priority to ensure relief of suffering even in times of social isolation; - Communication skills: making it possible to alleviate suffering in announcing bad news or complex decisions through communication techniques;; - Bereavement assistance: which in acute situations such as the pandemic, causing unexpected losses, the importance of sympathy from healthcare professionals becomes even greater. CONCLUSION: The principles of palliative care are essential to face the challenges of a planet-wide crisis, which raises human suffering in all dimensions, and which requires the construction of strategies that can keep patients assisted, comfortable and with measures proportional to their clinical condition and preferences.","output":"Palliative Renal Care and the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) and has rapidly spread worldwide, causing serious problems to the health care systems of many countries and hundreds of thousand deaths. In this review we discuss data from the literature to understand whether the various districts of the male reproductive system may represent another vulnerable target for SARS-CoV-2. Studies were searched from electronic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and COVID-19 specific databases such as LitCovid, until July 31, 2021. It appears that SARS-CoV-2 virus infection not only causes damage to the respiratory system, but could have a serious impact on the reproductive system of male patients modulating many physiological processes. Like some other infections, SARS-CoV-2 also leads to a worsening of semen quality and an increase in oxidative stress (OS) levels. However, due to the limited number of studies, it is unclear whether this deterioration in semen parameters is temporary or lasts over time.

Integrating nursing informatics into undergraduate nursing education is a cornerstone to nursing education and practice in Africa. AIM: This scoping review aimed to evidence the integration of nursing informatics into undergraduate nursing education in Africa. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature used electronic databases including CINAHL Plus databases; EmCare; MEDLINE Ovid; Scopus; ERIC ProQuest; Web of Science; Google; and Google Scholar to locate papers specific to the African context. From a total of 8723 articles, 19 were selected for critique and synthesis. RESULTS: Selected studies indicated that nursing students used several information and communication technologies tools primarily for academic purposes, and rarely for clinical practice. In Africa, the challenges for teaching informatics in nursing education included: limited information and communication technologies skills among faculty and students; poor teaching strategies; and a lack of standardization of nursing informatics competencies. Successful integration of nursing informatics into undergraduate nursing education in African countries depends on restructuring nursing informatics content and teaching strategies, capacity building of the faculty and students in information and communication technologies, political commitment, and collaborative partnership. CONCLUSION: Nursing informatics is scarce in undergraduate nursing education in Africa due to the implementation and adoption challenges. Responding to these challenges requires a multi\\\\sectoral approach in the revision of undergraduate nursing curricula. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING EDUCATION, PRACTICE, POLICY AND RESEARCH: This study highlights the importance of nursing informatics in undergraduate nursing education, with its challenges and success.

In preliminary reports it was suggested to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this open-label prospective study we describe clinical characteristics and outcome of 51 patients hospitalized with confirmed and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab intravenously. All patients had elevated IL-6 plasma level (>40 pg/mL) and oxygen saturation <93% in ambient air. Clinical outcomes, oxygen support, laboratory data and adverse events were collected over a follow-up of 30 days. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (88%) were on high-flow oxygen supplementation, six of whom with invasive ventilation. From baseline to day 7 after tocilizumab we observed a dramatic drop of body temperature and CRP value with a significant increase in lymphocyte count (p<0.001). Over a median follow-up time of 34 days from tocilizumab, 34 patients (67%) showed an improvement in their clinical severity class; 31 were discharged; 17 (33%) showed a worsening of their clinical status, of these 14 died (27%). The mortality rate was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation at baseline (83.3% vs 20% of patients on non-invasive oxygen support; p=0.0001). The most frequent side effects were an increase of hepatic enzymes (29%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and serious bacterial and fungal infections (27%). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab exerts a rapidly beneficial effect on fever and inflammatory markers, although no significant impact on the clinical outcome can be inferred by our results.

METHODS: In this study nine guideline-based interviews were conducted with residents. These were analyzed using the content-structured content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: perceptions and emotions related to the pandemic, changes and limitations due to the interventions and wishes in terms of the pandemic. The residents reported both emotional distress and not being afraid of infection and its consequences. In addition, some respondents reported unpleasant restrictions, such as wearing masks. In some cases their usefulness was critically questioned. Furthermore, various wishes of the residents in relation to the pandemic, such as leaving the nursing home, were identified.

CONCLUSIONS: CMH has the potential to help overcome many mental care barriers in the United Arab Emirates in particular and in the Arab world in general. CMH adoption in the United Arab Emirates has a potential for success. However, many factors should be taken into account, mainly cultural, religious, and linguistic aspects.","output":"A Conceptual Framework to Design Connected Mental Health Solutions in the United Arab Emirates: Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced visits to hospitals and clinics, forcing physicians and clinics to investigate how to move online using telemedicine and home monitoring. Wearable technologies can help by enabling homecare monitoring if they provide accurate and precise measurements. The monitoring of cardiac health problems is such an example and can be managed when patients are residing at home with the use of wearable cardiac monitoring equipment. Recent studies indicate that of various COVID-19 related complications, cardiac abnormalities in particular are associated with a significantly higher mortality rate. It is therefore important to develop smart wearables that are able to analyze and interpret the recorded signal to detect anomalies outside clinical environments where no external devices are available to analyze and store the signals, nor healthcare personnel is present to assist the identification of abnormal heart activity. This paper looks into two different approaches to enable smart wearables to analyze a high-definition electrocardiogram arriving from ECG sensors arrays in order to detect cardiovascular abnormalities. The first approach relies on techniques that enable the execution of deep-learning models within an embedded processor. The second approach uses heterogeneous multicore embedded processors that accelerate the execution of the classifiers. Results indicate the benefits of each approach and the interplay between the performance achieved in terms of event detection ratio and latency of classification. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Hardware-assisted and Deep-Learning techniques for Low-Power Detection of Cardiovascular Abnormalities in Smart Wearables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To provide data reference for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, promote the innovation and improvement of antibody detection technology of COVID-19, and discuss the application of antibody detection of new coronavirus by evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, compliance rate and limit of antibody detection in 10 SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kits Methods: According to the instructions of 10 new coronavirus antibody detection kits, the specific IgM and IgG in 74 serum samples were detect- ed, and the limit of detection of each kit was tested with 10 samples diluted by a 2-fold gradient Results: The coincidence rate of 10 kits(product A-product J)were 89 2%(66/74), 89 2%(66/74), 86 5%(64/74), 95 9%(71/74), 52 7%(39/74), 75 7%(56/74), 86 5%(64/74), 79 7%(59/74), 50 0%(37/74), 20 3%(15/74), respectively In the detection limit tests for the kits A-J with the 10 of 2x gradient diluted samples, the performance of kit C was the best, with the limit of detection for IgM 0 16AU/ml and the limit of detection for IgG 1 00 AU/ml Conclusion: There are significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, compliance and limit of detection of 10 new coronavirus antibody testing reagents, and the product of high sensitivity, specificity, and compliance rates should be selected for clinical applications to ensure the accuracy of test results","output":"Evaluation of 10 kits for antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We recently described a dynamic causal model of a COVID-19 outbreak within a single region. Here, we combine several instantiations of this (epidemic) model to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunityand the exchange of people between regionsand how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium. ? 2021 Friston KJ et al.","output":"Second waves, social distancing, and the spread of COVID-19 across the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The health care sector lost millions of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and job recovery has been slow, particularly in long-term care. OBJECTIVE: To identify which health care workers were at highest risk of exiting the health care workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted among individuals employed full-time in health care jobs from 2019 to 2021 in the US. Using the data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we compared turnover rates before the pandemic (preperiod, January 2019-March 2020; 71 843 observations from CPS) with the first 9 months (postperiod 1, April 2020-December 2020; 38 556 observations) and latter 8 months of the pandemic (postperiod 2, January 2021-October 2021; 44 389 observations). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health care workforce exits (also referred to as turnover) defined as a health care worker's response to the CPS as being unemployed or out of the labor force in a month subsequent to a month when they reported being actively employed in the health care workforce. The probability of exiting the health care workforce was estimated using a logistic regression model controlling for health care occupation, health care setting, being female, having a child younger than 5 years old in the household, race and ethnicity, age and age squared, citizenship status, being married, having less than a bachelors degree, living in a metropolitan area, identifier for those reporting employment status at the first peak of COVID-19, and select interaction terms with time periods (postperiods 1 and 2). Data analyses were conducted from March 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022. RESULTS: The study population comprised 125 717 unique health care workers with a mean (SD) age of 42.3 (12.1) years; 96 802 (77.0%) were women; 84 733 (67.4%) were White individuals. Estimated health care turnover rates peaked in postperiod 1, but largely recovered by postperiod 2, except for among long-term care workers and physicians. We found a 4-fold difference in turnover rates between physicians and health aides or assistants. Rates were also higher for health workers with young children (<5 years), for both sexes and highest among women. By race and ethnicity, persistently higher turnover rates were found among American Indian/Alaska Native/Pacific Islander workers; White workers had persistently lower rates; and Black and Latino workers experienced the slowest job recovery rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this observational cross-sectional study suggest that although much of the health care workforce is on track to recover to prepandemic turnover rates, these rates have been persistently high and slow to recover among long-term care workers, health aides and assistants, workers of minoritized racial and ethnic groups, and women with young children. Given the high demand for long-term care workers, targeted attention is needed to recruit job-seeking health care workers and to retain those currently in these jobs to lessen turnover.","output":"Tracking Turnover Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Foodborne illness outbreaks associated with fresh produce suggest a focus on food safety culture within food safety management systems throughout supply chains would benefit the horticulture industry. The recent inclusion of food safety culture in horticulture standards will drive the need for better understanding, integration into business activities, and monitoring, to help mitigate foodborne incidents in horticulture. Scope and approach The purpose of this review was to identify definitions of food safety culture and methods of measuring its performance in the context of the Australian horticulture industry. Investigation of how to better apply and integrate a positive food safety culture into existing food safety management systems was conducted. A roadmap for food safety culture improvement in Australian horticulture is presented, highlighting the challenges and opportunities. Key findings and conclusions To guide the development of a mature culture of food safety, mixed-method approaches to performance assessment were found to be the most comprehensive, valid, and offer the most potential for use by horticulture businesses. Food safety culture can be developed by using feedback from regular culture assessments that identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement, leading to increased knowledge, alignment of attitudes, and better food safety and hygiene behaviour. To this end, the development of measurement tools specific to horticulture operations would be beneficial.

It is crucial to assess how a third dose of vaccination modifies these responses, particularly for immunocompromised patients with readily impaired antibody responses. Objective: To determine T-cell responses to the Spike (S)-protein of Omicron in anti-CD20 treated patients before and after their third mRNA COVID-19 vaccination Design: Prospective observational monocentric study Setting: Conducted since March 2021 at the University Hospital Geneva Participants: Twenty adults with multiple sclerosis on anti-CD20 treatment (ocrelizumab) who received their third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 6 to 7 months after their second vaccination. Intervention: Blood sampling before and one month after the third vaccine dose Main outcomes and measures: Quantification of CD4 and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein of vaccine strain, Delta and Omicron variants , using activation marker induced assay (AIM) and comparing frequencies before and after the third vaccine dose. Results: S-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell memory against all variants was maintained in around half of the patients six months after their second vaccination, albeit at lower frequencies against Delta and Omicron variants. A third dose enhanced the number of responders to all variants and significantly increased CD8 T-cell responses. The frequencies of T cells specific to Omicron and Delta remained lower than those specific to the vaccine strain after the boost. Conclusion and relevance: Vaccinated MS patients on anti-CD20 treatment show robust T-cell responses that recognize S from the circulating Delta and Omicron variants. Response rates increased after the third dose, demonstrating that a booster dose might improve cytotoxic T-cell mediated protection against severe disease in patients with low humoral response. The clinical relevance of the reduced frequencies of T cells specific to Omicron will need to be monitored in the future.","output":"Omicron-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses are boosted following a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context Clinical autopsies have historically provided a fundamental contribution in the definition of the clinico-pathological basis of infectious diseases. Even though we are witnessing the decline of the clinical autopsy, its importance remains unchanged as it is the most exhaustive way to investigate diseases. The identification of the virus in postmortem tissues is a fundamental step in the definition of its clinical features. Objective To investigate the presence of Sars-CoV-2 in the postmortem with swabs. Design We performed postmortem swabs in 12 autopsy cases of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Sars-CoV-2 related pneumonia. Our protocol, consisted of a rhino-pharingeal and a tracheal swab in order to search for the virus in the upper airways and of two swabs on the parenchyma of each lung. We also performed a fifth swab on the parenchyma of both lungs in order to search for other viruses that could evolve in a clinical picture of interstitial pneumonia Results Overall we found that 9 out of 12 cases had at least one postmortem swab to be positive for Sars-CoV-2. Moreover we evaluated the time lapse between the antemortem and the postmortem swabs, the time between death and the postmortem swabs, and the time lapse between the postmortem swabs and the acceptance to the microbiology laboratory. Interestingly we did not find a relation neither between the results of the swabs and the time lapsed from their collection, or with the time lapsed before their acceptance in the microbiology laboratory. Conclusions A thorough knowledge of the eventual persistence of pathogens in deaths related to infectious diseases is fundamental for the safety of the operators during the autopsy practice, especially when referring to emergent pathogens like Sars-Cov-2. Our study highlights the importance in performing multiple swabs in the postmortem, since Sars-CoV-2 swab positivity can be limited to only a single swab.","output":"Postmortem swabs in the Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic: Report on 12 complete clinical autopsy cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In todays competitive business environment, the cost of a product is one of the most important considerations for its sale. Businesses are heavily involved in research strategies to minimize the cost of elements that can impact on the final price of the product. Logistics is one such factor. Numerous products arrive from diverse locations to consumers in todays digital era of online businesses. Clearly, the logistics sector faces several dilemmas from order attributes to environmental changes in this regard. This has specially been noted during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic where the demands on online businesses have increased several fold. Consequently, the methodology to optimise delivery cost and its impact on environmental focus by reducing CO2 emissions has gained relevance. The resultant strategy of Shipment Consolidation that has evolved is an approach that combines one or more transport orders in the same vehicle for delivery. Shipment Consolidation has been categorized in three order scheduling approaches: Time based consolidation, Quantity based consolidation, and a Hybrid (Time-Quantity) based consolidation. In this paper, a new Hybrid Consolidation approach is presented. Using the Hybrid approach, it has been shown that order delivery can be facilitated by taking into account not only the order pick up time, but also the total order quantity. These results have shown that if a time window is available in respect of the order delivery time, then the order can be delayed from pickup to consolidate it with other orders for cost optimization. This hybrid approach is based on four consolidation principles, two of which work on fixed departure and two, on demand departure. Three of these rules have been implemented and tested here with an application case study. Statistical analysis of the results is illustrated with different planning evaluation indicators. The Result analyses indicate that consolidation of orders is increased with each implemented rule hence motivating us towards the implementation of the fourth rule.

Acetylation of several proteins plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as viral infections. We reported that the nucleoproteins of influenza virus and Zaire Ebolavirus were acetylated, suggesting that these modifications contributed to the molecular events involved in viral replication. Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses identified 2 and 12 acetyl-lysine residues from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, respectively. Particularly in the SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, the acetyl-lysine residues were localized in or close to several functional sites, such as the RNA interaction domains and the M-protein interacting site. These results suggest that acetylation of SARS-CoV-2 N proteins plays crucial roles in their functions.","output":"In-vitro acetylation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins by human PCAF and GCN5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disrupted the daily order of many countries around the world. The new situation is an occasion to reflect on the value of life and health. While adjusting to functioning in the era of the epidemic, health decisions began to emerge, which had been considered unimaginable before. Information about the lack of access to basic protective and emergency equipment, cancelled procedures, overcrowded hospitals, and making it impossible to say goodbye to relatives dying in the hospital dominated the media. While the new reality may be confusing and overwhelming to many people, it is a good time to reflect on human and patient rights. Patients' rights are defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and in the Act of 6 November 2008 on Patients' Rights and Patients' Rights Ombudsman (Ustawa o praw pacjentw i Rzecznik Praw Pacjenta, UoPP). Among the rights listed in the AoPP, we can distinguish: The right to health services, the right to information, the right to medical documentation, the right to consent to health services, the right to information secrecy, the right to report adverse effects of medicinal products, the right to object to a doctor's opinion or ruling, the right to respect for intimacy and dignity, the right to respect private and family life. In the event of violation of rights, the patient may seek compensation before a civil court. Medical facilities, supported limiting patient's rights during pandemic with article 5 of UoPP, which points, that \\"the head of the healthcare provider or the medical doctor delegated by him may limit the exercise of patient rights in the event of an epidemic risk or for reasons of patient safety\\". It seems, that epidemic limited the right to health services the most. At the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, there were closures of health facilities, making registration and access to doctors impossible. The problem was partly solved by providing services to patients in the form of phone call consultation. The ongoing epidemic has highlighted the condition of the Polish health care system and has contributed to the exposure of problems that previously seemed to have been overlooked.

Caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory failure with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, it can also affect multiple organs. Kidney involvement was underestimated in early reports and its role remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of kidney damage in COVID-19 outcome. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 1603 consecutive patients admitted in a University Reference Hospital in the heart of the European outbreak. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, 40.4% were female, 15.2% presented diabetes mellitus, 35.7% hypertension and 20.3% obesity. On admission, the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine (sCr), proteinuria, leucocyturia and haematuria were 21.0, 37.8, 31.8 and 45.6%, respectively. In total, 43.5% of those with an elevated sCr had previous chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 11.4% of those with normal sCr developed an in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI); 17 patients needed acute haemodialysis; and 197 patients died during hospitalization. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline sCr [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.40 (1.79C3.22)], previous CKD [1.59 (1.06-2.37)], haematuria [1 + 1.68 (0.92C3.06), 2C3 + 2.69 (1.49C4.87)] and in-hospital AKI [1.50 (0.92C2.44)] were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity.

This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemics onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 AugustC5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81C8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37C5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception.

The aim of this study is to clarify the potential benefits and safety of diverting ileostomy (DI) following laparoscopic LAR in rectal cancer patients. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 417 rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR in a single institute. The risk factors for AL and the DI-related morbidity were assessed. RESULTS DI was performed in 226 patients (54.2%). The incidence rates of symptomatic AL showed no significant difference between patients with and without DI (8.4% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.612). AL requiring a surgical intervention was relatively lower in patients with DI than in those without DI (1.8% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.097). DI construction was an independent risk factor for AL requiring a surgical intervention (OR 3.47, p = 0.041), as was the serum albumin level (p = 0.003), and being male was a relative risk factor (p = 0.058). Focusing on sex, the rate of AL requiring a surgical intervention was significantly different in male (1.7 and 7.9%, p = 0.021) but not in female patients (1.9 and 1.1%, p = 1.000) with and without DI. The DI construction-related morbidity was 9.7%, and no patient required a reoperation. Of 226 patients with DI, 209 (92.5%) underwent stoma closure 118 days (median 30-509 days) after LAR. The stoma closure-related morbidity was 9.1% and 1 patient (0.5%) required a reoperation due to anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSIONS DI following laparoscopic LAR can decrease the risk of AL, requiring a surgical intervention, especially in male patients with malnutrition. However, due to DI-related morbidity, DI is not recommended in female patients.","output":"Who needs diverting ileostomy following laparoscopic low anterior resection in rectal cancer patients?

Such cases may provide unique insight into brain regions responsible for mania symptoms and identify therapeutic targets.METHODSLesion locations associated with mania were identified using a systematic literature search (n = 41) and mapped onto a common brain atlas. The network of brain regions functionally connected to each lesion location was computed using normative human connectome data (resting-state functional MRI, n = 1000) and contrasted with those obtained from lesion locations not associated with mania (n = 79). Reproducibility was assessed using independent cohorts of mania lesions derived from clinical chart review (n = 15) and of control lesions (n = 490). Results were compared with brain stimulation sites previously reported to induce or relieve mania symptoms.RESULTSLesion locations associated with mania were heterogeneous and no single brain region was lesioned in all, or even most, cases. However, these lesion locations showed a unique pattern of functional connectivity to the right orbitofrontal cortex, right inferior temporal gyrus, and right frontal pole. This connectivity profile was reproducible across independent lesion cohorts and aligned with the effects of therapeutic brain stimulation on mania symptoms.CONCLUSIONSBrain lesions associated with mania are characterized by a specific pattern of brain connectivity that lends insight into localization of mania symptoms and potential therapeutic targets.FUNDINGFundao para a Cincia e Tecnologia (FCT), Harvard Medical School DuPont-Warren Fellowship, Portuguese national funds from FCT and Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, Child Neurology Foundation Shields Research, Sidney R.

Aim: To analyze the trends of pneumonia during two waves of COVID-19 pandemic in order to use it as a clinical surveillance system and an early indicator of severity. Methods: Time series analysis of pneumonia cases, January 2014- December 2020. We collected pneumonia diagnoses from primary care EHR, covering >6 million people in Catalonia (Spain). We compared the trend of pneumonia in the season 2019-2020 with that in the previous years.

Many researchers rely on such models as they can be efficiently estimated and also provide interpretability. However, advances in machine learning research indicate that neural networks can be powerful data modeling techniques, as they can give higher accuracy for a plethora of learning problems and datasets. In the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models especially for intermediate length times series data. Their modeling capacities are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the large number of parameters that these non-linear models require. This paper presents an easy to implement data augmentation method to significantly improve the performance of such networks. Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which involves using forecasts from statistical models, can help unlock the power of neural networks on intermediate length time-series and produces competitive results. It shows that data augmentation, when paired with Automated Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Architecture Search, can help to find the best neural architecture for a given time-series. Using the combination of these, demonstrates significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy of three neural network-based models for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum improvement in forecasting accuracy by 21.41%, 24.29%, and 16.42%, respectively, over the neural networks that do not use augmented data.","output":"Improving Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting using Data Augmentation and AutoML"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: We report the case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-recovered, 42-year-old man with osteonecrosis and concomitant acute bacterial osteomyelitis of both hips and his left knee.

AIM: To identify key problems that arise during the formation of a new MO model based on a lean approach and to substantiate recommendations for overcoming them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The depth of the implementation of the principles of lean production was examined through a content analysis of the activities of MO positioning themselves as regional leaders. A systematic assessment of the results of their activities was developed based on the criteria of a new MO model providing primary medical and sanitary care. Seven medical institutions from different regions of the Russian Federation, i.e., the Volgograd, KhantyCMansiysk, Vologda, Belgorod, Kirov, Sevastopol and Vsevolozhsk, and Leningrad regions, were selected as study objects. Their geographical separation allowed identifying systemic problems in the introduction of the lean-manufacturing methodology and to present their generalized assessment. Trends in changing consumer preferences of MO patients were evaluated, the depth of the implementation of the lean approach in Russian MO was analyzed, the problems of creating a new MO model were identified, and the directions of overcoming them were determined. RESULTS: The content analysis of the depth of the successful implementation of MO activities identified the most frequently realized and completely unrealizable criteria of the new MO model. On this basis, three key problems of the application of the lean production principles in Russian medical institutions were identified: the lack of an integrated approach to the reorganization of activities, high formality of ongoing transformations, and insufficient involvement of all participants in providing medical services. These problems are possibly overcome by the following promising solutions: 1) informing medical staff about the results of alreadyCimplemented projects and increasing the level of visualization in management, 2) preferential realization of shortCterm, but effective projects, at the first stages, 3) application of the cascade principle of educating employees about the principles of lean production, 4) creation of a motivation system that supports continuous improvements, 5) expansion of the interaction between MO of different profiles, and 6) increasing the level of involvement of management, medical staff, and patients in MO processes. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the high awareness of the need to apply lean thinking in the activities of a modern MO. The degree of implementation of the principles of lean production becomes a determining condition for increasing the efficiency of their activities and competitiveness in the market of medical services. ?

But as much research and many real-world examples show, adversity can also stimulate innovation in some circumstances. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a number of recent examples where adverse conditions have led individuals, firms, and governments to innovate in the hopes of benefiting society.Despite the fact that some forms of adversity undermine innovation while others stimulate it, legal scholars have largely failed to distinguish between the two or even account for adversitys relationship to innovation when assessing innovation law and policy, including intellectual property (IP) laws. Yet given adversitys significant role in affecting the pace and direction of innovation, doing so is crucial. In this Article, we undertake that task. Our analysis shows that adversity is most likely to stimulate innovation when it satisfies what we call the Goldilocks principle: the adversity is neither too intense nor too mild, too fleeting nor too enduring, too all-encompassing nor too confined, too commonly experienced nor too isolated, too severe nor too insignificant, but instead is just right. Hence, for adversity to have the best chance of stimulating innovation, it should be (1) a relatively discrete experience;(2) of moderate intensity;(3) experienced collectively rather than in isolation;and (4) significant enough that, left unaddressed, the adversity could result in severe consequences for large groups of people. To be clear, these conditions are not necessary for innovationadversity, or some other trigger, might spur innovation even if each of these conditions is not met. Neither are they sufficientinnovation will not necessarily occur even if all of these conditions are present. Indeed, individual and organizational characteristics often play a role in determining whether a party will respond to adversity with innovation. But existing research suggests that these are some of the adverse conditions most conducive to, and thus most likely to inspire, innovation. Conversely, adverse conditions falling outside of these parameters are more likely to inhibit innovation, or at least fail to stimulate it.We then assess what this means for IP laws and innovation policy more generally. Predominant theories suggest that IP laws are meant to incentivize parties to benefit society through innovation and creativity. Yet over the years, commentators have pointed out that IP rights are often unnecessary to inspire these activities and thus at times impose unnecessary costs on society by restricting access to those innovations. We contribute to this important discussion by highlighting the role that adverse conditions frequently play in affecting the pace and direction of innovation. First, we argue that the role of adversity in stimulating certain innovations provides another reason to doubt the efficacy of IP rights as applied to many of those innovations. Other policy levers, such as grants and prizes, may often be preferable in such cases. Second, we explore possible solutions to innovation-inhibiting adversity, including bolstering IP rights in certain situations and a greater societal commitment to basic research funding. Finally, we examine the role that adversity can play in creating innovation path dependencies, and we briefly explore some possible solutions to this dilemma.","output":"Innovation in Adversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of Android handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people sitting in a pair of seats can cause variations of 10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins.

METHODS: Our study design is of a retrospective observational study in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients. In addition to descriptive statistics, a KaplanCMeier mortality analysis and a Cox regression were performed, as well as receiver operating curve (ROC). RESULTS: From February 5, 2020 to January 21, 2021, there was a total of 2969 admissions for COVID-19 at our hospital, corresponding to 2844 patients. Overall, baseline (within 4 days of admission) CONUT index could be scored for 1627 (57.2%) patients. Patients age was 67.3  16.5 years and 44.9% were women. The CONUT severity distribution was: 194 (11.9%) normal (0C1); 769 (47.2%) light (2C4); 585 (35.9%) moderate (5C8); and 79 (4.9%) severe (9C12). Mortality of 30 days after admission was 3.1% in patients with normal risk CONUT, 9.0% light, 22.7% moderate, and 40.5% in those with severe CONUT (P < 0.05). An increased risk of death associated with a greater baseline CONUT stage was sustained in a multivariable Cox regression model (P < 0.05). An increasing baseline CONUT stage was associated with a longer duration of admission, a greater requirement for the use of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and other clinical outcomes (all P < 0.05). The ROC of CONUT for mortality had an area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval of 0.711 (0.676C0746).

The limited number of authorized small-molecule direct-acting antivirals present challenges with pill burden, the necessity for intravenous administration or potential drug interactions. There remains an unmet medical need for effective and convenient treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that depends on host intracellular ribonucleotide pools for its replication. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a ubiquitous host enzyme that is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The inhibition of DHODH leads to a depletion of intracellular pyrimidines, thereby impacting viral replication in vitro. Brequinar (BRQ) is an orally available, selective, and potent low nanomolar inhibitor of human DHODH that has been shown to exhibit broad spectrum inhibition of RNA virus replication. However, host cell nucleotide salvage pathways can maintain intracellular pyrimidine levels and compensate for BRQ-mediated DHODH inhibition. In this report, we show that the combination of BRQ and the salvage pathway inhibitor dipyridamole (DPY) exhibits strong synergistic antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 by enhanced depletion of the cellular pyrimidine nucleotide pool. The combination of BRQ and DPY showed antiviral activity against the prototype SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants.

Differences in photocatalytic performance for these metals were assessed using rhodamine-B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) as model compounds for degradation. We have demonstrated that single atoms may either improve or impair the degradation of RhB and MO, depending on the proper matching of the net charge of these molecules and the surface potential of the catalyst, which in turn is responsive to the metal incorporated into the PHI nanostructures. Computer simulations demonstrated that even one transition metal cation caused dramatic changes in the electronic structure of PHI, especially regarding light absorption, which was extended all along the visible up to the near IR region. Besides introducing new quantum states, the metal atoms strongly polarized the molecular orbitals across the PHI and electrostatic fields arising from the electronic transitions became at least tenfold stronger. This simple proof of concept demonstrates that these new materials hold promise as tools for many important photocatalytic reactions that are strongly dependent on our ability to control surface charge and its polarization under illumination, such as H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and photooxidation in general.","output":"Graphitic carbon nitrides as platforms for single-atom photocatalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest challenge to date faced by the medical community in the 21st century.

Forest virus) inhibited GP(1,2)-mediated entry and infection of viruses comparably to or better than the Fc-tagged RBRs, whereas the -peptide-Fc of an ebolavirus nonpathogenic for humans (Reston virus) and that of an ebolavirus with lower lethality for humans (Bundibugyo virus) had little effect. These data indicate that -peptides are functional components of ebolavirus proteomes. They join cathepsins and integrins as novel modulators of filovirus cell entry, might play important roles in pathogenesis, and could be exploited for the synthesis of powerful new antivirals.","output":"Ebolavirus delta-peptide immunoadhesins inhibit marburgvirus and ebolavirus cell entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from convalescent patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Breast cancer patients receiving active systemic therapy need protection against COVID19 but the efficacy of vaccines in this population is unknown. Although specific biomarkers associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection have yet to be identified, measurement of serum antibody activity is generally accepted as a surrogate of in vivo humoral response to vaccine. This study evaluates the efficiency and durability of binding antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in response to COVID19 vaccine in breast cancer patients receiving systemic treatment. Methods: Breast cancer patients, who were unvaccinated, partially or fully vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 (PF), Moderna mRNA-1273 (Mod) or Johnson & Johnson AD26.COV2.S (J&J) were enrolled in this prospective longitudinal study. Eligible patients were on systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), CPI alone or a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Longitudinal blood samples are being collected at baseline, prior to vaccination in unvaccinated patients (T0), 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose and before Sthe second dose for the mRNA vaccines (T1), 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3), 6 months (T4) and 12 month post vaccination. For J&J, there was no T1 timepoint. Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody immunoassay was used to measure antibody titers (range 0.4 to 250 U/mL). Cut points of <0.8 U/mL = negative, 0.8 U/mL = seropositive, were based on validated product specifications. Results: Of the 84 breast cancer patients enrolled, 9 had documented COVID infection at baseline and were excluded from analysis. Mean age was 58 years;99% were female, 85% were Caucasian, 49% had early stage disease and 51% had metastatic breast cancer. 67% were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, 20% a CKD 4/6 inhibitor, 13% a CPI with or without chemotherapy. 61.2% were vaccinated with PF, 34.3% with Mod and 4.5% with J&J vaccines. Seropositivity rate for the entire group was 10% at T0, 78% at T1, 98% at T2 and 100% at T3. Seropositivity rates of all cohorts at different timepoints are shown in the table. Mean titers for all patients were 12.6 U/mL at T0, 102.3 U/mL at T1, 204.4 U/mL at T2 and 214.6 U/mL at T3 timepoints. Similar incremental increase in antibody levels was observed in all cohorts (Table). Conclusions: 78% of the patients with breast cancer on active systemic treatment were seropositive after the first dose of COVID19 vaccine and 98% after the second dose. The antibody response was maintained at 3 months, with 100% seropositivity rate. 6-month antibody response will be available at the time of presentation. Durability of antibody response at 6 and 12 months will help determine the timing of additional vaccine booster doses in this population. Importantly, this study has found that active treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy or CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy does not impact antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with breast cancer.

As such, it is crucial for students to learn teamwork for the purpose of securing a job and performing well in corporate environments. In addition to certain technical skills, essential 21st-century skills include communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. A well-known learning theory that helps students learn these skills is cooperative learning. Cooperative learning posits that when students collaborate within teams to solve complex problems, their creativity and critical thinking skills are improved as a result. Implementing cooperative learning in the past several months has been challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sudden shift from face-to-face to online instruction, has left a void for newer pedagogical approaches to teach teamwork. In this full paper, we investigate the impact of cooperative learning during the Spring 2020 semester by studying team retrospectives written by students enrolled in a system analysis and design course. The pedagogical foundation for the system analysis and design course was cooperative learning. The course required students to work in teams to develop a software prototype. The project was divided into four milestones and each team was required to submit a team retrospective detailing overall planning, task allocation, group processes, and strategies for improvement. The first two milestones were completed during face-to-face instruction, while teams met online for the last two milestones due to the shift to online instruction. To investigate team effectiveness, a rubric based on the Goals, Roles, Processes and Interpersonal relations (GRPI) model of team effectiveness was created and team retrospectives were scored using that rubric. We used a mixed-method approach to explore the following research questions: 1) What was the impact on team effectiveness when instruction changed from face-to-face to online due to the COVID-19 pandemic? 2)What strategies were adopted by teams to navigate the sudden change in instruction? To address the first research question, we performed inferential statistics to compare the impact of team effectiveness between face-to-face and online instruction. To address the second research question, we conducted a thematic analysis to understand the qualitative differences of team effectiveness for face-to-face and online instruction. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in teamwork effectiveness for online instruction. In addition, our thematic analysis shows particular strategies adopted by teams that led to improved team effectiveness in the online instruction environment. ?

METHODS: Annually, 890 to 1441 individuals were followed and contacted weekly to report ARIs. Specimens collected during illness were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) types OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. RESULTS: In total, 993 HCoV infections were identified over 8 years, with OC43 most commonly seen and 229E the least. HCoVs were detected in a limited time period, between December and April/May, and peaked in January/February. Highest infection frequency was in children <5 years (18 per 100 person-years), with little variation in older age groups (range: 7 to 11 per 100 person-years). Overall, 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children were associated with medical consultation. Of the 993 infections, 260 were acquired from an infected household contact. The serial interval between index and household-acquired cases ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days and the secondary infection risk ranged from 7.2% to 12.6% by type. CONCLUSIONS: Coronaviruses are sharply seasonal. They appear, based on serial interval and secondary infection risk, to have similar transmission potential to influenza A(H3N2) in the same population.","output":"Coronavirus occurrence and transmission over 8 years in the HIVE cohort of households in Michigan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diagnosing patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) remains difficult. Due to its non-specific symptoms, it is challenging to identify GCA in patients presenting with symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which is a more common disease. Also, commonly used acute-phase markers CRP and ESR fail to discriminate GCA patients from PMR and (infectious) mimicry patients. Therefore, we investigated biomarkers reflecting vessel wall inflammation for their utility in the accurate diagnosis of GCA in two international cohorts. METHODS: Treatment-na?ve GCA patients participated in the Aarhus AGP cohort (N = 52) and the Groningen GPS cohort (N = 48). The AGP and GPS biomarker levels and symptoms were compared to patients presenting phenotypically as isolated PMR, infectious mimicry controls and healthy controls (HCs). Serum/plasma levels of 12 biomarkers were measured by ELISA or Luminex. RESULTS: In both the AGP and the GPS cohort, we found that weight loss, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and higher angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios but lower matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 levels identify concomitant GCA in PMR patients. In addition, we confirmed that elevated platelet counts are characteristic of GCA but not of GCA mimicry controls and that low MMP-3 and proteinase 3 (PR3) levels may help to discriminate GCA from infections. CONCLUSION: This study, performed in two independent international cohorts, consistently shows the potential of angiopoietin-2/-1 ratios and MMP-3 levels to identify GCA in patients presenting with PMR. These biomarkers may be used to select which PMR patients require further diagnostic workup. Platelet counts may be used to discriminate GCA from GCA look-alike patients.

Complicating decision making, policy makers need to consider vaccine allocation strategies that balance needs both within and between populations. Due to limited vaccine stockpiles, vaccine doses should be allocated in locations where their impact will be maximized. Using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model we examine optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation decisions across two populations considering the impact of population size, underlying immunity, continuous vaccine roll-out, and heterogeneous population risk structure. We find that in the context of an emerging pathogen, where many epidemiologic characteristics might not be known, equal vaccine allocation between populations performs optimally in most scenarios. In the specific case considering heterogeneous population risk structure, first targeting individuals at higher risk of transmission or death due to infection leads to equitable resource allocation across populations.","output":"Comparative performance of between-population allocation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Running Title: CP Therapy in COVID-19 Patients BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease has strained our healthcare system. Convalescent plasma is an adjunct treatment used in emerging infectious diseases in past epidemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Median time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%), antibiotics (100%), remdesivir (95%), hemoperfusion (88%), tocilizumab (65%), or combinations of these. Among the survivors, the median length of stay (LOS) was 15 days while non-survivors had a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had a mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed deep vein thrombosis despite anticoagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH p value 0.04, CRP p value 0.00, Ferritin p value 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters-increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR;and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment. Median LOS is 14 days for the CP group vs 11 days for the non-CP group. Mortality rate among the CP group was 25.33% while the non-CP group was 26.67%. LOS and mortality rate did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients given CP vs controls. CP when combined with other treatment modalities might have a role in the improvement of inflammatory markers and pulmonary status.","output":"Use of convalescent plasma therapy among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients: A single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine has become an important branch of healthcare worldwide.

MethodsA cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1-to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the childs emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers stress during the pandemic.

ResultsIn total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9{+/-}1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were more affectionate (78.9%), more restless (65.1%), and more frustrated (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors. ConclusionThe pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile.

A proliferation of compartmental models was observed in the mathematical modelling community, aiming to understand and make predictions regarding the spread of COVID-19. Such approach has its own advantages and challenges: while compartmental models are suitable to simulate large populations, the underlying well-mixed population assumption might be problematic when considering non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) which strongly affect the connectivity between individuals in the population. Here we propose a correction to an extended age-structured SEIR framework with dynamic transmission modelled using contact matrices for different settings in Brazil. By assuming that the mitigation strategies for COVID-19 affect the connections between different households, network percolation theory predicts that the connectivity across all households decreases drastically above a certain threshold of removed connections. We incorporated this emergent effect at population level by modulating the home contact matrices through a percolation correction function, with the few remaining parameters fitted to to hospitalisation and mortality data from the city of Sao Paulo. We found significant support for the model with implemented percolation effect using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Besides better agreement to data, this improvement also allows for a more reliable assessment of the impact of NPIs on the epidemiological dynamics.","output":"Percolation across households in mechanistic models of non-pharmaceutical interventions in SARS-CoV-2 disease dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Successful implementation of asymptomatic testing programmes using lateral flow tests (LFTs) depends on several factors, including feasibility, acceptability and how people act on test results. We aimed to examine experiences of university students and staff of regular asymptomatic self-testing using LFTs, and their subsequent behaviours. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative study using semistructured remote interviews and qualitative survey responses, which were analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS: People who were participating in weekly testing feasibility study, between October 2020 and January 2021, at the University of Oxford. RESULTS: We interviewed 18 and surveyed 214 participants. Participants were motivated to regularly self-test as they wanted to know whether or not they were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most reported that a negative test result did not change their behaviour, but it did provide them with reassurance to engage with permitted activities. In contrast, some participants reported making decisions about visiting other people because they felt reassured by a negative test result. Participants valued the training but some still doubted their ability to carry out the test. Participants were concerned about safety of attending test sites with lots of people and reported home testing was most convenient. CONCLUSIONS: Clear messages highlighting the benefits of regular testing for family, friends and society in identifying asymptomatic cases are needed. This should be coupled with transparent communication about the accuracy of LFTs and how to act on either a positive or negative result.

In this research, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), which integrates determinants across eight models, was utilised to analyse students intentions to use and their actual usage of Moodle, an e-learning system at Hashemite University, a public university in Jordan, one of developing countries. Four principal determinants of intention and usage were explored: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Data were collected from 370 undergraduate students and analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. The results indicated that performance expectancy and effort expectancy affected behavioural intentions to use Moodle whereas social influence did not. In addition, the results confirmed the direct impact of behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions on students use of Moodle. UTAUT thus provides a valuable tool that enables university decision makers, faculty members, and designers to understand the factors driving e-learning system acceptance and thus facilitate the adoption of the system by students.

METHODS: This research employs the advantages of computer vision and medical image analysis to develop an automated model that has the clinical potential for early detection of the disease. Using Deep Learning models, the research aims at evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of different convolutional neural networks models in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images as compared to diagnosis performed by experts in the medical community. RESULTS: Due to the fact that the dataset available for COVID-19 is still limited, the best model to use is the InceptionNetV3. Performance results show that the InceptionNetV3 model yielded the highest accuracy of 98.63% (with data augmentation) and 98.90% (without data augmentation) among the three models designed. However, as the dataset gets bigger, the Inception ResNetV2 and NASNetlarge will do a better job of classification. All the performed networks tend to over-fit when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the small amount of data used for training and validation.

Visual simulation results showed that on the day 90, the number of the current symptomatic (infected) individuals may be between 852 and 7314, the number of the current asymptomatic (infected) individuals charged in the observations may be between 10066 and 50292, the number of the current cumulative recovered symptomatic infected individuals may be between 52070 and 74687, the number of the current cumulative asymptomatic individuals discharged from the medical observations may be between 63509 and 5164535. The number of the died symptomatic individuals may be between 801 and 1226. (a) The transmission rate of the symptomatic infections caused by the symptomatic individuals was much lower than the corresponding average transmission rate of the RMCE. (b) The transmission rate of the asymptomatic infections caused by the symptomatic individuals was much higher than the first 90 day's average transmission rate of RMCE. (c) The transmission rate of the symptomatic infections caused by the asymptomatic individuals was much lower than the first 60 day's average transmission rate of RMCE, and was much higher than the last 60 day's average transmission rate of RMCE. (d) The transmission rate to the asymptomatic infections caused by the asymptomatic individuals was much higher than the corresponding average transmission rate of RMCE. (e) The last30 days' average blocking rate to the symptomatic infections were lower than the last 30 days' average blocking rates of RMCE (f) The last 30 days' average blocking rate to the asymptomatic infections were much higher than the last 30 days' average blocking rate of RMCE. However the first 30 days' average blocking rate to the asymptomatic infections were much lower than the first 30 days' average blocking rate of RMCE. (g) The first 37 days' recovery rates of the symptomatic individuals were much lower than the corresponding first 70 days' recovery rates of the symptomatic individuals of RMCE. The recovery rates between 38- and 52-days of the symptomatic individuals were much lower than the corresponding the recovery rates between 91-and 115-days of the symptomatic individuals of RMCE. The last week's recovery rate was similar to the last week's recovery rate of RMCE. (h) The first 30 days' average recovery rate recovery rate to the symptomatic individuals were much lower than the first 30 days' average recovery rate recovery rate of RMCE . The last 30 days' average recovery rate recovery rate of the symptomatic individuals were still much lower than the last 30 days' average recovery rate of RMCE. Conclusions: The last 30 days' low blocking rates to the symptomatic infections, the first 30 day's low blocking rates to the symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, the low recovery rates of the symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and the high transmission rate of the asymptomatic infections may be the reasons to cause the rapid spread of the recent Shanghai epidemic. It needs to implement more strict prevention and control strategies, rise the recovery rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, and reduce the death rates for preventing the spread of this wave COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai.","output":"Summaries, Analysis and Simulations of Recent COVID-19 Epidemic in Shanghai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a shift in all our lives, turning in-class traditional educational systems into distance learning systems.

However, its mathematical optimization, especially finding when and how much of the population should be transported, is still a fundamental unresolved issue. We propose a new impulse control framework to tackle this issue based on a simple but new stochastic growth model of individual fishes. The novel growth model governing individuals' body weights uses a Wright-Fisher model as a latent driver to reproduce plausible growth dynamics. The optimization problem is formulated as an impulse control problem of a cost-benefit functional constrained by a degenerate parabolic Fokker-Planck equation of the stochastic growth dynamics. Because the growth dynamics have an observable variable and an unobservable variable (a variable difficult or impossible to observe), we consider both full-information and partial-information cases. The latter is more involved but more realistic because of not explicitly using the unobservable variable in designing the controls. In both cases, resolving an optimization problem reduces to solving the associated Fokker-Planck and its adjoint equations, the latter being non-trivial. We present a derivation procedure of the adjoint equation and its internal boundary conditions in time to efficiently derive the optimal transporting strategy. We finally provide a demonstrative computational example of a transporting problem of Ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) based on the latest real data set.","output":"Impulsive fishery resource transporting strategies based on an open-ended stochastic growth model having a latent variable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isoxazole, constituting an important family of five-membered heterocycles with one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom at adjacent positions is of immense importance because of its wide spectrum of biological activities and therapeutic potential.

Although activated spastic muscle's force-joint angle relations were studied, this was independent of gait relevant joint positions. The aim was to test the following hypotheses intraoperatively: (i) spastic gracilis passive forces are high even in flexed knee positions, (ii) its active state forces attain high amplitudes within the gait relevant knee angle range, and (iii) increase with added activations of other muscles. METHODS Isometric forces (seven children with cerebral palsy, gross motor function classification score = II) were measured during surgery from knee flexion to full extension, at hip angles of 45 and 20 and in four conditions: (I) passive state, after gracilis was stimulated (II) alone, (III) simultaneously with its synergists, and (IV) also with an antagonist. FINDINGS Directly measured peak passive force of spastic gracilis was only a certain fraction of the peak active state forces (maximally 26%) measured in condition II. Conditions III and IV caused gracilis forces to increase (for hip angle = 45, by 32.8% and 71.9%, and for hip angle = 20, by 24.5% and 45.1%, respectively). Gait analyses indicated that intraoperative data for knee angles 61-17 and 33-0 (for hip angles 45 and 20, respectively) are particularly relevant, where active state force approximates its peak values. INTERPRETATION Active state muscular mechanics, rather than passive, of spastic gracilis present a capacity to limit joint movement.

School closures caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have exposed adolescents to an increased risk of obesity due to a lack of physical activity. Although social network interventions provide an effective approach for promoting health-related behavior, current practices neglect gender differences in adolescent behavioral patterns and emotional preferences. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of centrality-based methods integrated with of gender contexts in a social network intervention to improve adolescent's health behavior. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model (ABM) that supports the small-world characteristics of adolescent social networks. Health-related data for junior middle school students (n = 234, 48% girls) were collected in November 2018, 2019 and 2020 in Tianjin, China. We simulated multiple network-based interventions with different criteria for influential agents (i.e., betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and PageRank) and a random condition. The rules for generating peer influence and accelerating behavioral changes were based on the diffusion of innovations theory, with gender specifications. RESULTS: After the school closures, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents, with a greater increase in girls than in boys (+8.85% vs. +1.65%, p < 0.001). Simulations showed that centrality-based network interventions were more effective than the random condition (average 6.17% per tick vs. 5.22% per tick, p < 0.05), with a higher efficiency in girls than boys (average 3.68% vs. 2.99% per tick, p < 0.05). PageRank outperformed other centrality conditions at the population level (6.37% per tick, p < 0.05). In girls, betweenness centrality was the best method (3.85% per tick, p < 0.05), while in boys, PageRank still had the greatest efficiency (3.21% per tick, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for gender differences in the negative impact of COVID-19-related school closures and the potential for centrality-based social network interventions to affect adolescent health behavior. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of gender-specific targeting strategies to further promote health-related school programs in the post-pandemic era.","output":"The Influence of a School Social Network Intervention on Adolescent's Health Behaviors: A Gender-Specific Agent-Based Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior for a stochastic SIS epidemic model with isolation which is as an important strategy for the elimination of infectious diseases.

COVID-19 presents not only urgent challenges for this hurricane season due to the likeliness of continued or heightened COVID-19 threat, but also challenges with the next hurricane season with additional waves of the pandemic. There is severe urgency to understand the impact of COVID-19 risk perceptions and the extent people are willing to risk their lives by sheltering in place rather than evacuating during severe hurricanes. In June 2020, a survey (in both English and Spanish) of 40 questions was disseminated through regional planning councils, emergency management, and the media to Florida residents. A total of 7,072 people responded from over 50 counties. Most data obtained were ordinal or categorical in nature, encouraging usage of nonparametric analysis and chi-square tests. Almost half the respondents view themselves as vulnerable to COVID-19 due to preexisting health conditions, and 74.3% of individuals viewed the risk of being in a shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic as more dangerous than enduring hurricane hazards. Additionally, there was a significant number of individuals who would choose to not utilize a public shelter during COVID-19 when they would have previously.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is one of the most widely used anticoagulants although LMWHs differ in their anti-Xa, antithrombin, and anticoagulant activities. To date, no study has directly compared the safety and efficacy of different LMWHs in the elderly. We aimed to compare such differences by conducting a network meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LMWHs that included patients 60 years old up to July 22, 2020. Safety outcomes included venous thromboembolism (VTE) or VTE-related death, deep thrombus embolism, and pulmonary embolism. Safety outcomes were clinically relevant bleeding, major bleeding, minor bleeding, and all-cause death. We calculated relative ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. The cumulative ranking probabilities (SUCRA) were conducted to rank the comparative effects and safety of all LMWHs. Results: We included 27 RCTs (30,441 elderly), comprising five LMWHs. LMWH was more effective than placebo in preventing VTE or VTE-related death (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25C0.53) but less effective than a novel oral anticoagulant (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.33C1.91) and safer than acenocoumarol regarding risk of clinically relevant bleeding (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49C0.90). However, indirect comparison of efficacy and safety of the five LMWHs showed no significant difference in our network analysis, and the subgroup analyses (such as in patients with deep venous thrombosis, cardiac disease, or age >65 years old) supported the results. The SUCRA showed that tinzaparin performed best in preventing VTE or VTE-related death (SUCRA 68.8%, cumulative probability 42.3%) and all-cause death (SUCRA 84.2%, cumulative probability 40.7%), whereas nadroparin was predominant in decreasing the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (SUCRA 84.8%, cumulative probability 77.0%). Conclusions: On present evidence, there are no significant differences in the efficacy and safety of different LMWHs for the elderly. According to the rank probability analysis, nadroparin seems to be safer for the elderly with a high risk of bleeding, whereas tinzaparin is more effective for those with low bleeding risk.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Low Molecular Weight Heparin for Thromboprophylaxis in the Elderly: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explains how the Disaster Resilience Scorecard, and its Public Health Addendum is an easy to use tool for governments in managing the COVID-19 crisis and ensuring effective recovery and build back better.

The aims were to explore the process of vaccination communication between health workers and parents (accepting, indecisive, delaying, refusing), and identify barriers and drivers to effective communication. In-depth interviews with 14 health workers were supplemented and qualified by observations of 40 consultations, using thematic analysis. Study sites were two community health centers in two Belgrade municipalities where a significant drop in childhood vaccination rates had occurred. Key findings were: (1) communication mainly took place between pediatricians and parents, while nurses focused on administering vaccines. (2) Health workers were confident in their skills to communicate and address concerns of accepting and indecisive parents, successfully applying specific strategies. (3) When interacting with delaying and refusing parents, they sometimes agreed to delay vaccination to maintain relationships, confident that most parents would vaccinate in due course. (4) Some refusing parents asked questions grounded in a socio-political agenda regarding vaccines or vaccination. Such questions exceeded the domain of health workers expertise, which affected the communication between them.

METHODS: Altogether, 219,959 adult patients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral) were identified in this nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Data on SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19 worsened outcomes (ie, the need for oxygen therapy, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation, and death) were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea. RESULTS: In this matched cohort, 380 of 12,217 patients with CRS (3.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared with 310 patients without CRS (2.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.42). Moreover, 60 of 286 COVID-19 patients with CRS (21.0%) had severe COVID-19 outcomes, compared with 38 without CRS (13.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.71). Subgroup analysis identified that CRS patients with an absence of nasal polyps, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, or nonatopic type had a greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRS, prior intranasal corticosteroid use, the absence of nasal polyps, or nonatopic type was associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in the Korean nationwide cohort. Clinicians should be cautious in determining prognosis and care for patients with CRS amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Estimating COVID-19 Infection and Severity Risks in Patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A Korean Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pedagogical Triangulations-COVID19 school experiences: the journey emerged in the context of the international pandemic and the experience of online teaching (referred to as E@D) as a time to experiment, question and reinvent curricular practices of pedagogical differentiation.

Healthcare professionals now have to make clinical assessments based on remote patient examinations. The number of tender and swollen joints a patient has drives decision-making in RA, making it particularly important that people with RA and HCPs have a shared understanding of these examinations. Even before remote consultations became widespread, long gaps between clinic visits create challenges in enabling HCPs to form an accurate picture of disease activity over time. The REMORA (REmote MOnitoring of Rheumatoid Arthritis) app aims to address this issue by asking people with RA to track disease activity, including counting the number of tender or swollen joints, weekly(1). Data are integrated into the electronic patient record for clinicians to access with patients during clinical consultations. As part of the supporting materials for the REMORA app, we planned to develop a video to train people with RA how to examine their own joints. This video may now help meet the need created by the recent expansion in remote consultations. Objectives: To describe the co-production, implementation and evaluation of a video to train patients how to examine their own joints. Methods: The need for the video to fill a current gap in patient education was identified by the REMORA patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group. A core working group comprising the PPIE lead, a nurse consultant, rheumatology clinicians, project and communications managers was formed. A storyboard was drafted and feedback gained from the PPIE group and wider REMORA team. Images were sourced from licenced suppliers, or co-developed with the PPIE group where necessary. No ethical approval was required as the PPIE group lead was acting as an equal member of the research term. Written informed consent was gained from video participants. Filming took place between two national lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a challenge to ensure social distancing and requiring the use of masks. Results: A 15 minute video to train people with RA to self-examine for tender and swollen joints was developed. An introduction outlining the rationale behind self-examination is followed by a nurse consultant coaching an RA patient in individual joint self-examination. Shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints and knees are included, all of which are counted in disease activity scores. Early feedback from stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. The video will be publicly available on YouTube from February 2021. A survey of patients and HCPs aims to obtain more formal feedback on the video, with a view to a further iteration, if required. Leading national organisations in rheumatology will promote the video, as it supports national programmes including the British Society for Rheumatology national early inflammatory arthritis audit and ePROMS (electronic patient report outcome measure) platform, both of which include entry of patient reported tender and swollen joint counts. Conclusion: This video was co-designed by people with RA, aiming to support self-examination of tender and swollen joint counts. Hits on YouTube and survey responses will help assess its impact. Evaluation to assess whether the video affects patients' ability to self-examine for tender and swollen joints before and after watching is planned. We hope the video will support remote consultations and help people with arthritis to better understand and self-manage their arthritis, and to have shared decision making conversations with their clinicians.","output":"How to self-examine for tender and swollen joints: Co-development of a training video for people with rheumatoid arthritis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo assess primary care physicians satisfaction towards COVID-19 pandemic management in Qatar and to identify the associated factors with their satisfaction.DesignA cross-sectional web-based survey conducted from 1 June to 30 July 2020.SettingAll the 27 public primary healthcare centres in Qatar.Participants294 primary care physicians working in the publicly run primary healthcare corporation in Qatar.Primary outcome measuresOverall satisfaction towards COVID-19 management in Qatar and satisfaction towards each aspect of this management including COVID-19 clinical practice guidelines, psychological support, team dynamics, work safety as well as institutional and governmental regulations.Results294 primary care physicians participated in the survey with a response rate of 65%.

Aims: We aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among doctors' spouses and the possible relationship between different variables and the level of the distress. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in online mode using chain-referral sampling method. Sample size was 120 and comprises doctors' spouses who were not related to medical field. Those who were working in medical field or having any past psychological illness were excluded from the study. A semi-structured pro forma was used to collect the basic demographic details, and Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to rate psychological distress. Results: 72.5% of the study population had reported psychological distress, and half of these participants reported severe psychological distress. Age was the single variable that had significance (P &lt; 0.1), whereas other variables did not show statistically significant values.

An educational website, containing application examples and several downloadable resources, was recently developed, to assist teaching by the new method. The co-creative character of this process is manifold, as students work together with the teaching staff and with their team colleagues to program virtual laboratory applications or to suggest improvements for the existing ones.

Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS. METHODS: This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes. Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed.

There were a wide variety of methods used to measure airborne virus, although surface sampling was generally undertaken using nylon flocked swabs. Overall, the quality of the measurements was poor. Only a small number of studies reported the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, mostly just reporting the detectable concentration values without reference to the detection limit.

COVID-19 related qualitative and quantitative data types were collected from the social media accounts of the surveyed national health ministries and agencies for analysis. Over 86% of the African countries had presence on social media;Facebook was the most popular, though Twitter contained more posts. One of the credibility issues that was noticed is that most of the health ministries' and agencies' social media accounts were unverified and access to the social media accounts was not provided on most of their official websites. Information dissemination became more deliberate and increased significantly after the announcement of the fist cases of COVID-19 in the countries under review. Awareness creation, updates and news constituted the major categories of information that were disseminated, mostly in the form of derivative social media information before the announcement of the first COVID-19 case in the surveyed African countries.

There are two bat genome projects currently underway, a circumstance that promises to speed the discovery host factors important in the coevolution of bats with their viruses. These genomes, however, are not yet assembled and one of them will provide only low coverage, making the inference of most genes of immunological interest error-prone. Many more wildlife genome projects are underway and intend to provide only shallow coverage. RESULTS: We have developed a statistical method for the assembly of gene families from partial genomes. The method takes full advantage of the quality scores generated by base-calling software, incorporating them into a complete probabilistic error model, to overcome the limitation inherent in the inference of gene family members from partial sequence information. We validated the method by inferring the human IFNA genes from the genome trace archives, and used it to infer 61 type-I interferon genes, and single type-II interferon genes in the bats Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus. We confirmed our inferences by direct cloning and sequencing of IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK in P. vampyrus, and by demonstrating transcription of some of the inferred genes by known interferon-inducing stimuli. CONCLUSION: The statistical trace assembler described here provides a reliable method for extracting information from the many available and forthcoming partial or shallow genome sequencing projects, thereby facilitating the study of a wider variety of organisms with ecological and biomedical significance to humans than would otherwise be possible.","output":"Chiropteran types I and II interferon genes inferred from genome sequencing traces by a statistical gene-family assembler"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Any crisis (personal or collective) brings along an in-built stress It cripples people from living a normal life;sometimes it leads people to the extreme condition of permanent damage The COVID-19 situation has brought in unexpected misery - victimizing millions of people It has been an equalizer as both the rich and the poor have been affected;both the affluent and the developing countries have become a prey to the pandemic For nearly one year the world is wondering which way to turn for comfort or solution, as the fear of the second and third waves looms over Science has not given the timely preventive medication;world leaders are not able to lead the people with effective insight;financial system is on the brink of collapse;and even the faith of people seems to become a question mark But any problem should have a solution, with often multiple aspects of solutions Apart from medicine, one could become strengthened to face the situation Starting with the analysis of the cause and the effect of Coronavirus Pandemic, this talk explores the intellectual and emotional aspects of the situation with the focus on the psychological and spiritual solutions to face the crisis;how to get reconciled with the reality;and how to thrive in his situation The ultimate goal is to come out of the crisis with a spirit of creativity If the pandemic is a period of cocoon, the butterfly-joy would be the hope to come out soon And we need to stay energized to realize the fullness of life with peace of the mind, health of the body, and joy of the heart Practical suggestions are put forward to face, encounter, and overcome the situation","output":"Stress Management: COVID-19 - Psychological and Spiritual Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on entrepreneurial performance in start-ups.

The pandemic has also increased the use of hypofractionated treatment schedules where magnetic resonance-guided online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation. This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, and thus the need for novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care. Methods and Materials: A remote-physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products. Our remote-physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour and review of the images and plans. The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote-physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote-physician ART coverage. Visual quality was calculated using cross-correlation between the treatment delivery and remote-physician computer screens. Results: For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24.9  6.1 minutes. In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29.2  9.8 minutes. The correlation between the console and remote-physician screens was R =.95. Conclusions: Our novel remote-physician ART coverage practice is secure, interactive, timely, and of high visual quality.

While credit supply helps boost economic growth through resource reallocation, excess credit supply can make the economy and financial market more vulnerable. In the event of a negative shock to the financial or real sector in a situation where credit is excessively supplied, asset prices sharply fall as the deleveraging proceeds. Moreover, economic activity can be sharply shrunk, thereby expanding the width and duration of the recession. The rapid credit crunch and stock price plunge that appeared in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the phenomenon in March 2020. Chapter 2 presents qualitative analysis and event studies to describe the relationship between credit supply, economic growth, and financial crisis. In the qualitative analysis, we visualize the long-term relationship by comparing the household, corporate, and government credit with macroeconomic variables in each country. In the cross-country comparison, the correlation of household credit and consumption is negative, while that of corporate credit and investment is positive, suggesting that the impact on economic growth is different for each type of credit. Moreover, to examine the relationship between private credit and GDP growth, we find that GDP generally grows faster in the group where private credit expands rapidly. This relationship, however, blurs in the highest-income group. In the event study, we consider the relationship between credit expansion and the financial crisis. We observe that private credit increased significantly before the banking crisis, including the global financial crisis. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in advanced economies. Chapter 3 examines a dynamic relationship between private and government credit and various macro variables by estimating the panel VAR model. Household credit shocks tend to increase real GDP in the short-run, mainly by boosting consumption. However, in the long-run, real GDP tends to be decreased by appreciating the real exchange rate, increasing non-tradable goods production, and decreasing productivity and current accounts surplus. On the other hand, the corporate credit shock is opposite to the household credit shock. Its impacts on real GDP are relatively small, leading to the real exchange rate decreasing and the production of trade goods. The macro variable responses to the government credit shocks are clearly distinguished from private credit shocks, but overall significance remains statistically low. In Chapter 4, we analyze the effect of credit supply on the possibility of a financial crisis using the panel probit model. We find that the household credit expansion significantly increases the probability of a banking crisis, while it does not affect the probability of a currency crisis. On the other hand, corporate credit expansion increases the probability of all types of crises. Government credit expansion tends to increase the probability of a government debt crisis. However, it is s atistically insignificant for the period before the other type of crisis, suggesting that the rapid government credit expansion in response to a financial crisis rather than the level of government credit increases the likelihood of a government debt crisis. Moreover, government credit expansion has the effect of lowering the probability of a banking crisis and a currency crisis, supporting the counter-cyclicality of government credit. In 2020, in the responses to the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of both private and government credits are sharply increased due to the massive fiscal stimulus programs and expansionary monetary policy. The impacts of household, business, and government credit on the macroeconomics can differ, so policymakers should pay attention to the level of total credit and the change in the composition of credit. In particular, it should be aware that the economic stimulus through short-term boosting of aggregate demand can lead to a deeper downturn by deteriorating in long-run productivity.","output":"A Study on Credit Supply, Economic Growth and Financial Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread of viral airborne diseases is becoming a critical problem for human health and safety, not only for the common cold and flu, but also considering more serious infection as the current pandemic COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the extent of potential differences between major groups of providers and staff in primary care, including behavioral health consultants (BHCs; eg, psychologists, social workers, and counselors), primary care providers (PCPs; eg, physicians and nurse practitioners), and nurses (registered nurses and licensed practical nurses) in the acceptance of various health technologies (ie, mobile apps, wearables, live video, phone, email, instant chats, text messages, social media, and patient portals) to support patient care across a variety of clinical situations. METHODS: We surveyed 151 providers (51 BHCs, 52 PCPs, and 48 nurses) embedded in primary care clinics across the United States who volunteered to respond to a web-based survey distributed in December 2020 by a large health care market research company. Respondents indicated the technologies they consider appropriate to support patients health care needs across the following clinical contexts: acute and chronic disease, medication management, health-promoting behaviors, sleep, substance use, and common and serious mental health conditions. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the distribution of demographic characteristics by provider type. We used contingency tables to compile summaries of the proportion of provider types endorsing each technology within and across clinical contexts. This study was exploratory in nature, with the intent to inform future research. RESULTS: Most of the respondents were from urban and suburban settings (125/151, 82.8%), with 12.6% (n=19) practicing in rural or frontier settings and 4.6% (n=7) practicing in rural-serving clinics. Respondents were dispersed across the United States, including the Northeast (31/151, 20.5%), Midwest (n=32, 21.2%), South (n=49, 32.5%), and West (n=39, 25.8%). The highest acceptance for technologies across clinical contexts was among BHCs (32/51, 63%) and PCPs (30/52, 58%) for live video and among nurses for mobile apps (30/48, 63%). A higher percentage of nurses accepted all other technologies relative to BHCs and PCPs. Similarly, relative to other groups, PCPs indicated lower levels of acceptance. Within clinical contexts, the highest acceptance rates were reported among 80% (41/51) of BHCs and 69% (36/52) of PCPs endorsing live video for common mental health conditions and 75% (36/48) of nurses endorsing mobile apps for health-promoting behaviors. The lowest acceptance across providers was for social media in the context of medication management (9.3% [14/151] endorsement across provider type). CONCLUSIONS: The survey suggests potential differences in the way primary care clinicians and staff envision using technologies to support patient care. Future work must attend to reasons for differences in the acceptance of various technologies across providers and clinical contexts. Such an understanding will help inform appropriate implementation strategies to increase acceptability and gain greater adoption of appropriate technologies across conditions and patient populations.","output":"Patient Digital Health Technologies to Support Primary Care Across Clinical Contexts: Survey of Primary Care Providers, Behavioral Health Consultants, and Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Government of India in-network with the state governments has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowd-sourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R0), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R(t)) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R(t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 epidemic curtailment strategies in selected Indian states: An analysis by reproduction number and doubling time with incidence modelling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the pandemic brought on by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), consumers of applied behavior-analytic interventions may be experiencing disrupted access to services.

The protein four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) serves as the anchor. FHL2 associates with O-GlcNAcylated TRAK and is both necessary and sufficient to drive the accumulation of F-actin around mitochondria and to arrest mitochondrial movement by anchoring to F-actin. Disruption of F-actin restores mitochondrial movement that had been arrested by either TRAK O-GlcNAcylation or forced direction of FHL2 to mitochondria.

However, due to large uncertainty early in development, as well as model complexity, testing all possible combinations of interventions and deployments becomes infeasible.

This study aimed to explore the associations of objective cognitive performances and psychological distress with cognitive complaints in COVID-19 survivors. Materials and Methods: Patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19 in a university hospital during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in France were followed-up at 1 month after their admission. Cognitive complaints were self-reported and standardized instruments were used to assess neuropsychological status (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Semantic Verbal Fluency Test, Mini Mental Status Examination) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS). Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for oxygen and C-reactive protein. Results: One hundred patients (34% women, median age: 60 years [interquartile range: 49C72)] completed the neuropsychological assessment at follow-up. In multivariable analyses, cognitive complaints at 1-month were associated with greater HADS score (OR for one interquartile range: OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08C3.57) and older age (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01C1.09) and, negatively, with admission in ICU (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05C0.90). In contrast, none of the objective neuropsychological test scores was significantly associated with cognitive complaints. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive complaints were associated with both anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Several studies have been performed, focusing on understanding the acute respiratory syndrome and treatment strategies. However, there is growing evidence indicating neurological manifestations occur in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the other coronaviruses (CoV) epidemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have been associated with neurological complications. METHODS: This systematic review serves to summarize available information regarding the potential effects of different types of CoV on the nervous system and describes the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-five studies on CoV infections associated neurological manifestations in human were reviewed. Of those, 208 articles were pertinent to COVID-19. The most common neurological complaints in COVID-19 were anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but more serious complications, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizures, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. CONCLUSION: There are several similarities between neurological complications after SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, however, the scope of the epidemics and number of patients are very different. Reports on the neurological complications after and during COVID-19 are growing on a daily basis. Accordingly, comprehensive knowledge of these complications will help health care providers to be attentive to these complications and diagnose and treat them timely.","output":"Neurological complications of coronavirus infection; a comparative review and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Library began planning for the Fall 2020 semester knowing that COVID-19 and social unrest stemming from police actions across the country would impact library safety for the university community The goal for reopening was to implement best practices that incorporated University health and safety guidelines as well as student feedback A task force conducted 12 focus group sessions between June 18C26, 2020, in which 56 university students participated Students identified physical distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), and monitoring compliance in the library as primary concerns The campus libraries made extensive changes to its facilities, access to materials and services, and conduct policies to address these issues This paper will benefit library leaders and administrators making tough and unprecedented time-sensitive decisions using evidence-based data from stakeholders [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Library Administration is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Student Voice in Administrative Decision-Making: Inclusive Planning during the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The standard model of cosmology is underpinned by the assumption of the statistical isotropy of the Universe.

A comprehensive understanding of the core virome of diverse rodents should therefore assist in efforts to reduce the risk of future emergence or re-emergence of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens. RESULTS: This study aimed to describe the viral range that could be detected in the lungs of rodents from Mainland Southeast Asia. Lung samples were collected from 3284 rodents and insectivores of the orders Rodentia, Scandentia, and Eulipotyphla in eighteen provinces of Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia throughout 2006C2018. Meta-transcriptomic analysis was used to outline the unique spectral characteristics of the mammalian viruses within these lungs and the ecological and genetic imprints of the novel viruses. Many mammalian- or arthropod-related viruses from distinct evolutionary lineages were reported for the first time in these species, and viruses related to known pathogens were characterized for their genomic and evolutionary characteristics, host species, and locations. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of the core viromes of rodents and insectivores from Mainland Southeast Asia and suggest that a high diversity of viruses remains to be found in rodent species of this area. These findings, combined with our previous virome data from China, increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife and arthropod vectors in emerging disease hotspots of East and Southeast Asia.

However, many consumers are not willing to make such a transition, because of attachment to meat and unwillingness to change habits. The present work explored the perception of Norwegian and French consumers' attitudes, barriers and opportunities to increase the likelihood of a shift in diet. Three creative focus groups (CFGs), using interactive tasks such as photo-collage, projective mapping, story completion and third person technique, were run with omnivorous adult consumers in each country. CFGs gathers undirected feedback, providing less biased responses than other exploration methods, related to e.g. social norms. In both countries, results were in general lines comparable. Nutritional knowledge was low regarding vegetable proteins; familiar sources of protein were mostly animal. There is a strong gap between respondents' desired behaviour (balancing nutrition, eating less meat) and their actual behaviour: meat is very important, and the menu is often organized around it. Consumers are curious about vegetable sources of protein, but major constraints were hedonics in France, and convenience in Norway. The main barrier to a shift in diet is the lack of knowledge on how to prepare plant-based meals. Many participants find a conflict between health & sustainability in industrial products, perceiving them as highly processed and suggesting that meat replacers might not be a straightforward way to drive omnivorous consumers to shift to a more plant-based diet.","output":"Meat replacer?

Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes is a new and promising complementary tool for the control of arbovirus transmission. The use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, mass reared using human blood, is currently being tested in several countries. However, the use of human blood for mass rearing mosquitoes, and thus expansion of this strategy, is problematic. With the aim of overcoming this problem, we tested the effect of different types of blood source on the fitness parameters of female Ae. aegypti and the Wolbachia titer over generations to be able to guarantee the suitability of an alternative source to human blood for mass rearing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. METHODS: We investigated and compared essential parameters of the vector capacity of laboratory strains of Ae. aegypti with and without Wolbachia that fed on blood of different types of host (human, guinea pig, and mouse). The parameters analyzed were fecundity, fertility, pupation dynamics, and adult survival. Also, we tested whether it is possible to maintain mosquitoes with Wolbachia on mouse blood over generations without losing the bacterium titer. RESULTS: The average number of eggs per female, egg viability and pupation dynamics in the Wolbachia-infected mosquito (wMelBr) strain were similar, regardless of the blood source. The F1 progenies of females that fed on mouse blood or human blood were analyzed. The longevity of males was lower than that of females. F1 female survival differed depending on the presence of Wolbachia in the mother. In subsequent generations analyzed up until F35, the relative Wolbachia density was even higher when mosquitoes fed on mouse blood in comparison to human blood. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results provide no evidence that the different types of blood influenced the fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The presence of the bacterium in the colonies of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti after 35 generations under the conditions evaluated indicates that they can be maintained on mouse blood. Based on these results, we show that it is possible to use mouse blood to feed female mosquitoes when using human blood for this purpose is problematic.

The impact of viral load in asymptomatic infected children is important to understand transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period at a large tertiary care childrens hospital. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data was available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic.

MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: Mental disorders were assessed using the \\"Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\\" and social support was determined using the \\"Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.\\" Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term.

METHODS A total of 174 patients who underwent primary THA from September 2016 to July 2018 were selected. They were randomly divided into two groups, 86 patients with IV administration of 15 mg/kg TXA and 88 controls without TXA usage.

Developing automatic segmentation tools in a short period with limited labelled images has become an urgent need. Pseudo label-based semi-supervised method is a promising way to leverage unlabelled data to improve segmentation performance. Existing methods usually obtain pseudo labels by first training a network with limited labelled images and then inferring unlabelled images. However, these methods may generate obviously inaccurate labels and degrade the subsequent training process. To address these challenges, in this paper, an active contour regularized semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to automatically segment infections with few labelled images. The active contour regularization is realized by the region-scalable fitting (RSF) model which is embedded to the loss function of the network to regularize and refine the pseudo labels of the unlabelled images. We further design a splitting method to separately optimize the RSF regularization term and the segmentation loss term with convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) and stochastic gradient descent, respectively, which enable fast optimization of each term. Furthermore, we build a statistical atlas to show the infection spatial distribution. Extensive experiments on a small public dataset and a large scale dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5\\\\% in DSC and NSD, 10\\\\% in RAVD and $8mm$ in 95\\\\% HD.

Therefore, the development of effective antifibrotic drugs is urgently required. IMB-S7 is novel biphenyl compound derived from bifendate (biphenyldicarboxylate) that is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis in China. In the current study we investigated the potential of IMB-S7 as an antihepatic fibrosis agent. In bile duct ligation (BDL) rat model, oral administration of IMB-S7 (400 mg kg(?1) d(?1), for 14 days) significantly ameliorated BDL-induced liver necrosis, bile duct proliferation, and collagen accumulation. We then showed that IMB-S7 treatment markedly suppressed the TGF-/Smad pathway in human hepatic stellate cell line LX2 and mouse primary HSCs, as well as in liver samples of BDL rats, thus inhibiting the transcription of most fibrogenesis-associated genes, including TGF-1, COL1A1, and ACTA2. Furthermore, IMB-S7 treatment significantly suppressed the expression of integrin v at the mRNA and protein levels in TGF--treated LX2 cells and liver samples of BDL rats. Using integrin v overexpression and silencing, we demonstrated that integrin v activity correlated positively with the activation of TGF-/Smad pathway. Based on dual luciferase assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay, we revealed that IMB-S7 inactivated integrin v through competitively inhibiting the binding of Sp1, a transcription factor, to the integrin v (ITGAV) promoter (?173/?163 bp). These results suggest that IMB-S7 inhibits HSCs activation and liver fibrosis through Sp1-integrin v signaling, and IMB-S7 may be a promising candidate to combat hepatic fibrosis in the future.","output":"A novel biphenyl compound IMB-S7 ameliorates hepatic fibrosis in BDL rats by suppressing Sp1-mediated integrin v expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to analyze data derived from Social Media In our time people and devices constantly generate data The network is generating location and other data that keeps services running and ready to use in every moment This rapid development in the availability and access to data has induced the need for better analysis techniques to understand the various phenomena We consider a Text Mining and a Sentiment Analysis of data extracted from Social Networks The application regards a Text Mining Analysis and a Sentiment Analysis on Twitter, in particular on tweets regarding Coronavirus and SARS ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"A Text Mining Analysis on Big Data Extracted from Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the report of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in late December 2019, there have been 204 610 cases worldwide as of 18 March, 2020.

We analyzed text and chat transcripts from Childhelp's National Child Abuse Hotline from May-June 2020 that were flagged as coming from a child with a COVID-19-related concern (N = 105). Thematic analysis was used to identify COVID-19 related influences of family conflict as well as how COVID-19 constraints influenced coping and survival for youth reporting distress or maltreatment to the hotline. Family conflict most commonly disclosed stemmed from parental or child mental health concerns, often manifesting in escalated child risk taking behaviors, parental substance use, and violence in the home. Conflict was also mentioned surrounding caregiver issues with child productivity while sheltering-in-place, commonly related to school or chores. Youth often voiced feeling unable to find relief from family conflict, exacerbated from physical distance from alternative social supports, technological isolation, and limited contact with typical safe places or supportive adults. To cope and survive, youth and crisis counselors found creative home-based coping skills and alternative reporting mechanisms. Understanding the unique impact of COVID-19 on youth in homes with family conflict and abuse can point to areas for intervention to ensure we are protecting the most vulnerable as many continue to shelter-in-place. In particular, this study revealed the importance of online hotlines and reporting mechanisms to allow more youth to seek out the help and professional support they need.","output":"\\"The Stay at Home Order is Causing Things to Get Heated Up\\": Family Conflict Dynamics During COVID-19 From The Perspectives of Youth Calling a National Child Abuse Hotline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As deep learning plays an increasing role in making medical decisions, explainability is playing an increasing role in satisfying regulatory requirements and facilitating trust and transparency in deep learning approaches.

As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations: Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries. Oncologists in the United States facing unprecedented decisions about prioritization can draw on ethical frameworks and lessons learned from real-world cancer care priority setting in resource-constrained environments.","output":"Applying Lessons Learned From Low-Resource Settings to Prioritize Cancer Care in a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to examine the literature to determine if both paediatric and adult patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at a higher risk of poor outcomes if they have the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), compared to those without CHD. METHODS A systematic review was executed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. To identify articles related to COVID-19 and CHD, an extensive literature search was performed on EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, and Global Health databases using keywords and MeSH terms. RESULTS A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis in this systematic review. Two themes were identified for data extraction: evidence supporting higher risks in CHD patients and evidence against higher risks in CHD patients. After combining the data, there were 99 patients with CHDs out of which 12 required admissions to ICU. CONCLUSION This systematic review suggests that CHD may increase the risk of poor outcomes for those with COVID-19, but also highlights the necessity for more research with larger sample sizes in order to make a more justified conclusion, as the majority of papers that were analysed were case series and case reports.

The features are clinically relevant and allow clinicians to document and observe the quantified movements and the changes of these metrics over time. A web server and a user interface for recordings viewing and feature visualizations are available. DNE was evaluated on a collected dataset of 21 subjects containing normal and simulated-impaired movements.

Methods A single-dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was administered to 477234 South African Healthcare Workers between 17 February and 17 May 2021. Monitoring of adverse events used a combination of passive reporting and active case finding. Telephonic contact was attempted for all adverse events reported as allergy. Anaphylaxis adjudication was performed using the Brighton Collaboration (BCC) and NIAID case definitions. Results Only 251(0.052%) patients reported any allergic-type reaction(less than 1 in 2000), with four cases of adjudicated anaphylaxis (BCC level 1, n=3)(prevalence of 8.4 per million doses). All anaphylaxis cases had a prior history of drug or vaccine-associated anaphylaxis.

METHODS A systematic review was performed with searches in major and regional databases for papers published 1 January 1945 to 25 April 2017. Included studies provided data on physical and/or developmental outcomes associated with armed conflict in children under 18 years. Data were extracted on health outcomes, displacement, social isolation, experience of violence, orphan status, and access to basic needs. The review is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017036425. FINDINGS Among 17,679 publications screened, 155 were eligible for inclusion. Nearly half of the 131 quantitative studies were case reports, chart or registry reviews, and one-third were cross-sectional studies.

Studies also described conflict-related social changes affecting child health. The geographical coverage of the literature is limited. Data on the effects of conflict on child development are scarce. INTERPRETATION The available data document the pervasive effect of conflict as a form of violence against children and a negative social determinant of child health. There is an urgent need for research on the mechanisms by which conflict affects child health and development and the relationship between physical health, mental health, and social conditions.

Another key issue is the widely popular assumption among experimenters that participants do not influence each other -- which is far from reality in a field study and can, if unaccounted for, deteriorate the quality of the trial. We address both issues in our work. After introducing randomized controlled trials bridging terms from different disciplines, we first address the issue of participant-treatment assignment in the presence of known covariate factors.

All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h). CONCLUSIONS Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care unit patients. The role of hypoalbuminemia during dalbavancin exposure merits further investigation.","output":"Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Dalbavancin Treatment in Severe Necrotizing Fasciitis in 3 Critically Ill Patients: A Grand Round."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: With the expanding use of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), lead interference with the tricuspid valve (TV) causing significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has gained increasing recognition. However, current knowledge about the long-term results of the surgical treatment of TR in this setting is scanty. Therefore, increasing this information was the goal of this study. METHODS: A retrospective review of our institutional database was carried out to select all patients with previously implanted CIEDs who underwent tricuspid valve repair and replacement from 2000 through 2019. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to analyse long-term survival. To describe the time course of TR, we performed a longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were identified. Mechanical interference with leaflet mobility and coaptation was detected in 103 patients (68%) (CIED-induced group); in the remaining 48 patients (32%), the lead was associated with TR without being the cause of it (CIED-associated group). A total of 105 patients underwent TV repair; in the remaining 46, a TV replacement was necessary. In patients who underwent TV repair, no significant difference in moderate TR recurrence rate was highlighted between CIED-induced and CIED-associated TR. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CIEDs and surgically treated tricuspid regurgitation, TR is CIED-induced in about two-thirds of the cases and CIED-associated in one-third of them. In our experience, TV repair was still possible in 63% of the cases, with good long-term results and no significant durability difference between CIED-induced and CIED-associated TR.","output":"Surgical treatment of tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: long-term results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] There is a growing trend toward the use of interaction network methods and algorithms, including community-based detection methods, in various fields of science. The approach is already used in many applications, for example, in social sciences and health informatics to analyze behavioral patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, proteinCprotein networks in biological sciences, agricultural science, economy, and so forth. This paper attempts to build interaction networks based on high-entropy alloy (HEA) descriptors in order to discover HEA communities with similar functionality. In addition, these communities could be leveraged to discover new alloys not yet included in the data set without any experimental laboratory effort. This research has been carried out using two community detection algorithms, the Louvain algorithm and the enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The data set, which is used in this paper, includes 90 HEAs and 6 descriptors. The results reveal 13 alloy communities, and the accuracy of the results is validated by the modularity. The experimental results show that the method with the PSO-based community detection algorithm can achieve alloy communities with an average accuracy improvement of 0.26 compared to the Louvain algorithm. Furthermore, some characteristics of HEAs, for example, their phase composition, could be predicted by the extracted communities. Also, the HEA phase composition has been predicted by the proposed method and achieved about 93% precision.","output":"Machine Learning Approach to Community Detection in a High-Entropy Alloy Interaction Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the capacity of health systems to continue the delivery of essential health services. While health systems around the world are being challenged by increasing demand for care of COVID-19 patients, it is critical to all other services including sexual reproductive health services. Countries are expected to ensure optimal balance between fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and maintenance of essential health services like sexual reproductive health. The purpose of this report was to assess and document continuity of sexual and reproductive health services with a focus on safe abortion, post abortion care and family planning services during the COVID -19 pandemic in selected countries of the World Health Organization Africa Region. Methods: : A descriptive survey using a simplified and user-friendly virtual web based rapid needs assessment through a questionnaire was filled in by key informants drawn from the ministries of health from 30 countries in July 2020. The questionnaires were filled in by the World Health Organization staff in charge of sexual reproductive health services in collaboration with their counterparts in the ministries of health and uploaded in excel data sheets and categorized in to thematic areas for analysis. Results: : Responses were received from 17 countries out of the 30 countries that received the questionnaires. Of the 17 countries, only 2 (12%) countries reported that sexual and reproductive health services are not integrated in the essential health services package. All the sexual reproductive health elements-family planning/contraception and comprehensive abortion care, including post abortion care are integrated in the essential health services package in 12 (80%) of the 15 countries that have sexual reproductive health integrated. Also,14(82%) countries reporting having ongoing awareness raising campaigns/communication messages about family planning, comprehensive abortion care and post abortion care during the COVID pandemic. 9(59%) of the countries reported reduction in the use of family planning services, 6(35%) indicated no changes in the use of family planning services with only 2(12%) countries providing no response. Conclusion: The survey provides information on the weak health systems of the participating member states of the WHO Africa Region and the magnitude of disruptions of sexual reproductive health services in selected countries. Further, strategies adopted by countries to ensure continuity of sexual reproductive health services amidst COVID -19 like communications, Countries finally identified key areas that need to be supported in family planning/contraception, comprehensive abortion care and post abortion care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Continuity of Essential Sexual and Reproductive Health Services During Covid-19 Pandemic in the Who African Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The main feature of IPF is a heterogeneous appearance with areas of sub-pleural fibrosis. However, the mechanism of sub-pleural fibrosis was poorly understood. In this study, our in vivo study revealed that pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) migrated into lung parenchyma and localized alongside lung fibroblasts in sub-pleural area in mouse pulmonary fibrosis. Our in vitro study displayed that cultured-PMCs-medium induced lung fibroblasts transforming into myofibroblast, cultured-fibroblasts-medium promoted mesothelial-mesenchymal transition of PMCs. Furthermore, these changes in lung fibroblasts and PMCs were prevented by blocking TGF-?1/Smad2/3 signaling with SB431542. TGF-?1 neutralized antibody attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Similar to TGF-?1/Smad2/3 signaling, wnt/?-catenin signaling was also activated in the process of PMCs crosstalk with lung fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of CD147 attenuated cultured-PMCs-medium induced collagen-I synthesis in lung fibroblasts. Blocking CD147 signaling also prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

The methodology applies novel hierarchical heuristic-simulation procedures to create a holistic algorithm for prioritising the process of demand allocation and optimising vaccine distribution. The Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia with a population of over five million is used as a case study. Three vaccine supply scenarios, namely limited, excessive, and disruption, were formulated to operationalise a two-dose vaccination program. Vaccine distribution with hard constraints were simulated and then further validated with sensitivity analyses. The results show that vaccines can be prioritised to societys most vulnerable segments and distributed using the current logistics network with 10 vehicles. Compared with other vaccine distribution plans with no prioritisation, such as equal allocation of vaccines to local government areas based on population size or one on a first-come-first-serve basis, the plans generated by the proposed DSS ensure prioritised vaccination of the most needed and vulnerable population. The aim is to curb the spread of the infection and reduce mortality rate more effectively. They also achieve vaccination of the entire population with less logistical resources required. As such, this study contributes to knowledge and practice in pandemic vaccine distribution and enables governments to make real-time decisions and adjustments in daily distribution plans.

Notably, it has a well-established role in the DNA damage response. While it was historically known as a post-translational modification of proteins, recent studies have shown that nucleic acids can also serve as substrates of reversible ADP-ribosylation. More precisely, ADP-ribosylation of DNA bases, phosphorylated DNA ends and phosphorylated RNA ends have been reported. We will discuss these three types of modification in details. In a variety of bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ADP-ribosylation of thymidine has emerged as the mode of action of a toxin-antitoxin system named DarTG, with the resultant products perceived as DNA damage by the cell. On the other hand, mammalian DNA damage sensors PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 were shown to ADP-ribosylate phosphorylated ends of double-stranded DNA in vitro. Additionally, TRPT1 and several PARP enzymes, including PARP10, can add ADP-ribose to the 5-phosphorylated end of single-stranded RNA in vitro, representing a novel RNA capping mechanism. Together, these discoveries have led to the emergence of a new and exciting research area, namely DNA and RNA ADP-ribosylation, that is likely to have far-reaching implications for the fields of DNA repair, replication and epigenetics.","output":"ADP-ribosylation of DNA and RNA()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 vaccination has been in the spotlight for almost a year now, both within the scientific community and in the general population. The issue of healthcare workers' (HCWs) hesitancy is particularly salient, given that they are at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. Not only could unvaccinated HCW spread the disease, but HCWs are also critical messengers in building confidence towards COVID-19 vaccines. The goal of this study was to examine the perception of COVID-19 risk and of its vaccine acceptance among employees (i.e., HCW plus administrative staff) in the Department of Paediatrics, Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Hospitals of Geneva, for the purpose of drawing lessons on the determinants of vaccination morale. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey comparing vaccination attitudes among vaccinated and unvaccinated workers in June 2021. It included questions on perception of COVID-19 risks and COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination was not mandatory in our institution but was strongly recommended. RESULTS: In June 2021, 66% of the 1,800 employees of our department had received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the time of the survey. Among the employees, 776 participated (43%) to the survey, and among them 684 (88%) had chosen to be vaccinated. Participants working for longer in a hospital, with a chronic disease and a household contact with chronic disease were more likely to be vaccinated. Doctors were twice as likely to be vaccinated than nurses. Among unvaccinated hospital employees, 48 (52%) responded that they would not change their mind. Further, 35 (38%) were not feeling in danger of contracting severe COVID-19, and 32 (35%) had fears about possible side effects of COVID-19 vaccines that they wanted to discuss with a specialist. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that, while two-third of the employees had been vaccinated, quite many were still hesitant. The unvaccinated explained their choice by not feeling at risk of complicated COVID-19, and because of fear of possible side effects associated with the vaccine. Investments in COVID-19 vaccine education is a critical component for increasing vaccine acceptance among the unvaccinated.","output":"Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccine Among Hospital Employees in the Department of Paediatrics, Gynaecology and Obstetrics in the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assess protection from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of 16,101 university students (2,021 with and 14,080 without previous infection).

Here, we report development and application of a structural bioinformatics protocol to design peptides that can inhibit RdRp complex formation by targeting the interface of its core subunit nonstructural protein (nsp) 12 with accesory factor nsp7. We adopt a top-down approach for protein design by using interaction hotspots of the nsp7-nsp12 complex obtained from a long molecular dynamics trajectory as template. A large library of peptide sequences constructed from multiple hotspot motifs of nsp12 is screened in silico to determine peptide sequences with highest shape and interaction complementarity for the nsp7-nsp12 interface. Two lead designed peptide are extensively characterized using orthogonal bioanalytical methods to determine their suitability for inhibition of RdRp complexation and anti-viral activity. Their binding affinity to nsp7 (target), as determined from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, is found to be comparable to that of the nsp7-nsp12 complex. Further, one of the designed peptides gives 46 % inhibition of nsp7-nsp12 complex at 10:1 peptide:nsp7 molar concentration (from ELISA assay).

The microvascular thrombosis is an underappreciated complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with profound implications on the development of multisystem organ failure. The telltale signs of perpetual on-going coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades underscore the presence of diffuse endothelial damage in the patients with COVID-19. These parameters serve as strong predictors of mortality. While summarizing the alterations of various components of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19, this review points to the emerging evidence that implicates the prominent role of the extrinsic coagulation cascade in COVID-19-related coagulopathy. These mechanisms are triggered by widespread endothelial cell damage (endotheliopathy), the dominant driver of macro- and micro-vascular thrombosis in these patients. We also summarize other mediators of thrombosis, clinically relevant nuances such as the occurrence of thromboembolic events despite thromboprophylaxis (breakthrough thrombosis), current understanding of systemic anticoagulation therapy and its riskCbenefit ratio.

In this study, we reviewed EEG records of six aortic arch procedures that used cannulation of the innominate artery to provide selective antegrade cerebral perfusion. In each case, a transient hemispheric asymmetry was noted within 2 minutes of the start of head cooling, consisting of enhanced suppression over the right compared with the left hemisphere, which was confirmed by power analysis. The EEG returned to baseline during passive-head rewarming in five cases, whereas a brief left-sided partial seizure occurred during rewarming in one case. These findings suggest that antegrade cerebral perfusion using cannulation of the innominate artery results in enhanced cooling of the right hemisphere as detected by intraoperative EEG monitoring.

The centre coordinates a network of eight individual cancer MDTs with three satellite hospitals. Following adaptation to virtual format, remote participants now join by videoconference, telephone call, or by phone application. Methods: A 30-part questionnaire was developed in electronic format and distributed to consultants who comprise the senior membership of the cancer MDTs. The objectives were to investigate experience of the virtual meetings post-implementation, and assess preference regarding the future of the meetings. Results: Among 36 respondents, surgeons accounted for 38.9%, medical oncologists (22.2%), pathologists (13.9%), radiologists (11.1%), haematologists (5.6%) and radiation oncology, palliative care and physicians for 2.8% each. The most common means of joining the meeting included videoconference (61.1%), physical attendance at MDT room (19.4%), telephone (11.4%) and by phone application (8.3%). 67% experienced difficulties using the technology including issues connecting (67%) and screen-sharing (50%). 78% reported that the virtual format did not affect their attendance at MDT, with 11% reporting increased attendance. 56% thought the case discussion at the virtual MDT was not as in-depth as the conventional MDTs, but a majority (81%) believe that decisions made are not impacted by the virtual format. 71% believe it has negatively impacted on education. Most respondents (40%) preferred the traditional face-to-face format, with 37% preferring a combination of virtual and face-to-face. The majority of consultants determine that virtual MDTs should continue past social distancing guidelines.

This will have a large impact on increasing students moral imagination. This study examines the use of AR-based behavior simulation, as an innovative technique for learning ethics, to improve moral imagination. This study employs a 3  2 experiment method, three training modes (AR-based behavioral simulation, paper-based-behavioral simulation, and no training) and two times (time one and time two) between- and within-subject factorial design. The subjects are 147 students on a business ethics course. The result of this study reveals that the use of AR-based behavior simulation can improve moral imagination.","output":"Does behavior simulation based on augmented reality improve moral imagination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a harmful disease caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus COVID-19 disease comprises symptoms such as cold, cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing COVID-19 has affected many countries and their spread in the world has put humanity at risk Due to the increasing number of cases and their stress on administration as well as health professionals, different prediction techniques were introduced to predict the coronavirus disease existence in patients However, the accuracy was not improved, and time consumption was not minimized during the disease prediction To address these problems, least square regressive Gaussian neuro-fuzzy multi-layered data classification (LSRGNFM-LDC) technique is introduced in this article LSRGNFM-LDC technique performs efficient COVID prediction with better accuracy and lesser time consumption through feature selection and classification The preprocessing is used to eliminate the unwanted data in input features Preprocessing is applied to reduce the time complexity Next, Deming Least Square Regressive Feature Selection process is carried out for selecting the most relevant features through identifying the line of best fit After the feature selection process, Gaussian neuro-fuzzy classifier in LSRGNFM-LDC technique performs the data classification process with help of fuzzy if-then rules for performing prediction process Finally, the fuzzy if-then rule classifies the patient data as lower risk level, medium risk level and higher risk level with higher accuracy and lesser time consumption Experimental evaluation is performed by Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset using different metrics like prediction accuracy, prediction time, and error rate The result shows that LSRGNFM-LDC technique improves the accuracy and minimizes the time consumption as well as error rate than existing works during COVID prediction","output":"Deming least square regressed feature selection and Gaussian neuro-fuzzy multi-layered data classifier for early COVID prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The month of Ramadan forms one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith.

In addition, due to the often high-calorie meals eaten to break the fast, Ramadan should be seen as a cycle of fasting and feasting. Ramadan fasting can impact those with diabetes, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and dehydration. This year, Ramadan will occur during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reports show that diabetes appears to be a risk factor for more severe disease with COVID-19. In addition, the UK experience has shown diabetes and COVID-19 is associated with dehydration, starvation ketosis, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state. This makes fasting in Ramadan particularly challenging for those Muslims with diabetes.

We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that these maps highly resolve the cis-regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression. Finally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.","output":"Index and biological spectrum of human DNase I hypersensitive sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 was one like no other, as we witnessed the far-reaching impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic.

However, transitioning surveillance approaches to small populations, such as dormitories and assisted living facilities poses challenges including difficulties with sample collection and processing. Recently, the need for reliable and timely data has coincided with the need for precise local forecasting of the trajectory of COVID-19. This study compared wastewater and clinical data from the University of Delaware (Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters), and evaluated wastewater collection practices for enhanced virus detection sensitivity. Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur in infected individuals. However, shedding concentrations and duration has been shown to vary. Therefore, three shedding periods (14, 21, and 30 days) were presumed and included for analysis of wastewater data. SARS-CoV-2 levels detected in wastewater correlated with clinical virus detection when a positive clinical test result was preceded by fecal shedding of 21 days (p < 0.05) and 30 days (p < 0.05), but not with new cases (p = 0.09) or 14 days of shedding (p = 0.17). Discretely collected wastewater samples were compared with 24-hour composite samples collected at the same site. The discrete samples (n = 99) were composited examining the influence of sampling duration and time of day on SARS-CoV-2 detection. SARS-CoV-2 detection varied among dormitory complexes and sampling durations of 3-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour (controls). Collection times frequently showing high detection values were between the hours of 03:00 to 05:00 and 23:00 to 08:00. In each of these times of day 33% of samples (3/9) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the control sample. The remainder (6/9) of the collection times (3-hour and 12-hour) were not different (p > 0.05) from the control.

In the last decade, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the structural mechanisms of IL-6 family signaling, particularly for IL-6 itself. However, our understanding of the detailed structural mechanisms underlying signaling by most IL-6 family members remains limited. With the emergence of new roles for IL-6 family cytokines in disease and, in particular, roles of IL-11 in cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer, there is an emerging need to develop therapeutics that can progress to clinical use. Here we outline our current knowledge of the structural mechanism of signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines. We discuss how this knowledge allows us to understand the mechanism of action of currently available inhibitors targeting IL-6 family cytokine signaling, and most importantly how it allows for improved opportunities to pharmacologically disrupt cytokine signaling.

During the spring of 2020, the cessation of all elective surgical procedures and the diminished number of outpatient visits challenged graduate medical education. While residency programs in less affected areas may not have had to make many dramatic adjustments, some of those located in pandemic hotspots had to redirect trainees from orthopaedic rotations to COVID-19 units. No matter the region, the time that trainees have spent in rotations has been altered, and absences have occurred due to quarantines. This symposium summarizes the impact of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on residency and fellowship programs from the perspectives of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), a program director, and a graduating resident. Although new opportunities for virtual curricula, virtual surgical simulation, and virtual interviews have been innovated, residency programs and residents report primarily a negative effect from the pandemic due to decreased surgical volumes and the limitation of patient-care experiences. Ultimately, program directors have an obligation to the program, the trainee, and the general public to graduate only those residents and fellows who are truly prepared to practice independently; they have the responsibility of making the final decision regarding graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to underscore the need for competency-based medical education. Assessing competency includes evaluation of the knowledge, the operative skills, the nonoperative patient-care skills, and the professional behavior of each and every individual graduating from orthopaedic residency and fellowship training programs. A hybrid model for time and competency-based training, with established national standards not only for accreditation for our training programs but also for board certification of our graduating residents, was enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic and is highlighted in this symposium.","output":"COVID-19: Impact on Orthopaedic Graduate Medical Education in the U.S.: AOA Critical Issues Symposium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficient induction and long-term persistence of pathogen-specific memory CD8 T cells are pivotal to rapidly curb the reinfection.

METHODS A point scale and entrance criteria were developed for the diagnosis of DCS. Once the entrance criterion had been met, points were awarded based upon the diver's symptoms and their time of onset. The point system and time limits (SANDHOG criteria) were determined based upon US Navy and Royal Canadian diving reports. The SANDHOG criteria were then applied on a post hoc basis to the Duke Hyperbaric database of diving injuries. Sensitivity and specificity were then calculated using three points as the cut off. The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis was performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS The three point SANDHOG criteria had a specificity of 90.3% and a sensitivity of 52.7%. ROC analysis of the original SANDHOG criteria gave an AUC of 0.72. Using different point values for the diagnosis of DCS will subsequently affect the sensitivity and specificity of the SANDHOG criteria.

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to the cellular surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); in addition, the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is needed for priming of the spike (S) protein of the virus.

Given that the uncertainty of how COVID-19 kills, hampers doctors' ability to choose treatments the need for a deep understanding of COVID-19 biology is urgent. Herein, we performed an expression profiling meta-analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes (and proteins) in public repository databases and found that all are widely expressed in human tissues; also, the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes tend to be co-regulated. The ACE2 and TMPRSS genes expression is (among others) suppressed by TNF, and is induced by pro-inflammatory conditions including obesity, Barrett's esophagus, stomach infection by helicobacter pylori, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and oxidized LDL; by exercise, as well as by growth factors, viruses' infections, cigarette smoke, interferons and androgens.

Survey completers who did not activate their account (n=5) identified that their lack of use was due to time constraints, competing priorities, or forgetting to use the application. Survey completers who activated their account (n=5) identified their lower use was due to lack of time, lack of eligible family/friend caregivers during trial period, and competing priorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 78.75, and the Net Promoter Score was 50. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate a generally positive response for the usability of a web-based application for clinicians to prescribe dementia education to family/friend caregivers. The dissonance between the promising data and widespread enthusiasm for the design and purpose of the education prescription application found in the initial user testing phase and subsequent lack of significant adoption in the field trial represents both an important lesson for other novel health technologies and a potential area for further investigation. Further research is required to better understand factors associated with implementation of this type of intervention and impact on dissemination of education to family/friend caregivers.","output":"A Novel Educational Prescription Web-Based Application to Support Education for Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Development and Usability Study With Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on quality of life appears to be highly underestimated, especially in patients who have not been admitted to the hospital Therefore, our aim was to assess respiratory-specific quality of life in addition to generic quality of life in former patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 who have never been admitted to the hospital Members of an online Belgian social support group for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 with persistent complaints, completed an online survey The five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were used to assess generic and respiratory-specific quality of life, respectively Data of 210 non-hospitalized patients (88% women, 45 &plusmn;11 years, 79 &plusmn;17 days after symptom onset) were included in the analyses Mean EQ-5D index and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) score was 0 62 &plusmn;0 19 and 50 71 &plusmn;18 87, respectively, with 40% of the patients demonstrating an EQ-5D index that was below the fifth percentile of normative values, indicating poor generic quality of life The mean CCQ score was 2 01 &plusmn;0 98 points, while 123 respondents (59%) had a total score &ge;1 9 points, indicating poor respiratory-specific quality of life The correlation between EQ-5D index score/EQ-VAS score and CCQ total score was moderate (r = &minus;0 524 and r = &minus;0 374;both p &lt;0 001) In conclusion, both generic and respiratory-specific quality of life are affected in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, approximately three months after the onset of symptoms The combined use of the EQ-5D and the CCQ could identify the broad impact of COVID-19 on quality of life","output":"Generic and Respiratory-Specific Quality of Life in Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can lead to acute cor pulmonale (ACP).

While successful at the time, this rigid and inflexible management philosophy has become synonymous with cost and schedule overruns of most high-profile space missions. The software industry has recently adopted modern, more flexible project management techniques based on lean-agile methods that enable team collaboration and communication through distributed task and schedule management, online document sharing and rolling-wave planning. However, due to the inherent schedule complexities of hardware development and the firm constraints of design review and launch timelines, flexible project management frameworks have not been widely adopted for space mission management. This paper presents a modified version of the traditional agile management philosophy, adapted to the unique needs of the space industry. A recent satellite development project was managed using the new modified-agile approach, while collecting project hours and task durations. Comparisons were made between this new style of space project management and a recently completed satellite development project using traditional space project management techniques. Results show that the new management approach reduced strain on the project team, improved overall productivity, and maintained a more level task loading when compared to the traditional management approach.

Objective: To describe and compare the outcomes of cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 on routine screening vs. non-routine screening at a multi-site tertiary cancer center. To identify risk factors for COVID-19-related hospital admission. Design: A multi-site prospective observational study was conducted between March 18 and July 31, 2020. Setting: Three major and 5 satellite campuses of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center. Participants: Adult patients diagnosed with active cancer within the past five years and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Primary Outcomes and Measures: Clinical and laboratory data were assessed as independent variables. The primary outcome was COVID-19- related hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and all-cause mortality. Results: Between March 18 and July 31, 2020, 5452 patients underwent routine screening in the outpatient setting, 44 (0.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Routine screening detected additional 19 patients from inpatient and pre-procedural settings;161 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on non-routine screening.

In this study, a computational approach was adopted to identify a multiepitope vaccine candidate against this virus that could be suitable to trigger a significant immune response. Sequences of the spike proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool, to identify the most immunogenic protein. Both T cell immunity and B cell immunity were checked for the peptides to ensure that they had the capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

An epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature search and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on Indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1-5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators.

Whether paramedics have a duty to treat under extreme conditions and what acceptable limitations may be placed on such a duty require urgent consideration. The purpose of this research is to encourage discussion within the paramedic profession and broader community on this important ethical and legal issue. METHODS The authors employed qualitative methods to gather paramedic and community member perspectives in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS These findings suggested that both paramedic and community member participants agree that acceptable limitations on paramedic duty to treat during disaster are required. These limitations should be based on consideration of the following factors: personal health circumstances (eg, pregnancy for female paramedics); pre-existing mental health conditions (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder/PTSD); competing personal obligations (eg, paramedics who are single parents); and unacceptable levels of personal risk (eg, risk of exposure and infection during a pandemic).

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that respond to viral infection and might relate to COVID-19 disease severity. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new predictive score for progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19 based on NK cells information. Method: In total, 239 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from two medical center in China were retrospectively included. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical data and laboratory findings from the electronic medical records of each hospital, were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier methods. A prognostic score was developed to predict progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19. Results: : Among the 239 patients, 216 (90.38%) patients had mild/moderate disease and 23 (9.62%) progressed to severe disease. After adjusting multiple confounding factors, pulmonary disease, age >75, IgM, CD16 + /CD56 + NK cells and aspartate aminotransferase were independently predictors of progression to severe COVID-19. Based on these five factors, a new predictive score (the PAINT score) was established and showed a high predictive value (C-index = 0.91, 0.902  0.021, p<0.001). The PAINT score was validated using nomogram, bootstrap internal validations, calibration curves, decision curves and clinical impact curve, all of which confirmed its high predictive value. Conclusions: : The PAINT score for progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19 based on NK cell information may be helpful to identify patients at high risk of progression.

Following infection, glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis increase in infected cells continually, which results in higher glucose consumption. The pentose phosphate shunt, as another glucose-consuming pathway, is enhanced by influenza infection to help produce more nucleotides, especially ATP. Regarding lipid species, following infection, levels of triglycerides, phospholipids, and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations, some of which are associated with inflammatory responses. Also, mitochondrial fatty acid -oxidation decreases significantly simultaneously with an increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids. Moreover, essential amino acids are demonstrated to decline in infected tissues due to the production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. Immune responses against influenza infection, on the other hand, could significantly affect metabolic pathways. Mainly, interferon (IFN) production following viral infection affects cell function via alteration in amino acid synthesis, membrane composition, and lipid metabolism. Understanding metabolic alterations required for influenza virus replication has revealed novel therapeutic methods based on targeted inhibition of these cellular metabolic pathways.","output":"Metabolic host response and therapeutic approaches to influenza infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: MRI imaging biomarkers can non-invasively characterize liver tissue potentially allowing early diagnosis and treatment. Proton density fat fraction (PDFF), R2?, and T1 and T2 times are relevant biomarkers measuring fat (PDFF), iron content (R2?), inflammation, and fibrosis (T1, T2). This study takes advantage of the MRI screening program that was established at our institution for myocarditis in competitive athletes recovering from COVID-19. The purpose of this project was to establish hepatic reference values for these biomarkers for the specific population of young competitive adult athletes. Methods: This retrospective study was HIPAAcompliant and IRB approved. Clinical cardiac MRI exams of competitive student athletes recovering from COVID-19 acquired between 01/2020 and 04/2021 at 1.5T or 3T were screened. 3D confounder-corrected PDFF and R2? maps were obtained over the entire liver in the axial plane, while T1 and T2 maps obtained through the heart in the double oblique short axis view also visualized large portions of the left lobe of the liver. PDFF, R2?, T1 and T2 Maps were analyzed with OsiriX (pixmeo SARL, Switzerland). In PDFF and R2? maps, the largest possible ROIs were placed in each Couinaud segment avoiding vessels, bile ducts, and artifacts. In T1 and T2 maps, the largest possible ROI was placed in each slice that included the liver. For each patient and map, the mean value of the liver ROIs was recorded. Results were compared between field strengths and sex using t-test. Results: 105 athletes matched the inclusion criteria (35 female, 191 years, BMI 265 kg/m). One patient was excluded due to clinical and imaging findings of COVID-associated myocarditis. 10 subjects had an elevated PDFF between 5.1% and 11.3%, one athlete had a mild iron overload (R2?= 136 s-1 at 1.5T). Gender- and field strength-specific results are compiled in Table 1. PDFF, R2?, and T1 values differed significantly between field strengths. T1 and T2 times differed significantly between gender at 3T and 1.5T, respectively. Conclusion: We generated gender- and field strength-specific reference values for hepatic T1, T2, PDFF and R2? in young athletes. Our results are consistent with published normal values for adults, with PDFF and T1 at the lower end of published values. The prevalence of pathologic hepatic fat and iron content was low.

Methods: The method of this study is based on the use of school areas and building data, the creation of 4m2 social distance areas for students, and the evaluation of these areas in terms of health measures. To this aim, first, the relevant guidelines issued by the government institutions in Turkey during the COVID-19 process were examined, in relation to how they will reflect on education policies regarding the sanitary safety of schools. This data was obtained from open-source data sets. Then, in the application stage, 20 schools were selected in order to analyse the sustainability of education in the Balgat district. In addition, the sanitary conditions of classrooms and garden areas were evaluated within the framework of educational policies, taking into account the capabilities of geographical information systems (GIS). Results: The findings indicated that 95% of school gardens comply with pandemic regulations, and only 38.9% of school classes can support education in two periods through binary grouping. Conclusions: It has been concluded that school buildings are well-planned in terms of health measures for gardens and classes.

Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. Methods: This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The cross-sectional study data was collected using an online survey following the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with some other basic information collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of socio-demographic and media specific factors on anxiety and depression. Results: The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores. Conclusion: This study indicated that higher media consumption was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Worldwide it should be acknowledged that excessive media consumption, particularly social media relating to COVID-19, can have an effect on mental health. However, as this was a cross-sectional study we cannot infer any directionality as we cannot infer cause and effect; therefore, future research involving longitudinal data collection and analyses of variables over time is warranted.","output":"Media consumption and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: a UK cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for a severe course of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and vulnerable to mental health problems. We aimed to investigate prevalence and associated patient (demographic and clinical) characteristics of mental wellbeing (health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and symptoms of depression and anxiety) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in older patients with advanced CKD. METHOD: An ongoing Dutch multicentre prospective cohort study enrols patients of 70 years with an eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73m(2) from October 2018 onward. With additional questionnaires during the pandemic (May-June 2020), disease-related concerns about COVID-19 and general anxiety symptoms were assessed cross-sectionally, and depressive symptoms, HRQoL, and emotional symptoms longitudinally. RESULTS: The 82 included patients had a median age of 77.5 years (inter-quartile range 73.9-82.1), 77% was male and none had tested positive for COVID-19. Cross-sectionally, 67% of the patients reported to be more anxious for COVID-19 because of their kidney disease, and 43% of the patients stated that their quality of life was reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). Higher COVID-19-related stress was associated with a lower education level (p=0.036), and patients who reported to feel more down due to COVID-19 were more often female (p=0.020). Anxiety scores were higher among females compared to males (median 4.0 [IQR 3.0-9.0] versus 2.0 [0.0-6.0], p=0.020), and weakly associated to a decline in eGFR (correlation coefficient 0.197, p=0.023). Compared to pre-COVID-19, presence of depressive symptoms had increased (11% to 22%; p=0.022) and physical HRQoL declined (40.410.1 to 36.110.4, p<0.001). Mental HRQoL (50.39.6 to 50.49.9; p=0.913) and emotional symptoms remained similar. Males showed a greater decline in physical HRQoL (mean -5.3, SD 8.5) compared to females (mean -0.9, SD 5.7; p=0.039). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that older patients with advanced CKD suffered from disease-related anxiety for COVID-19, increased depressive symptoms, and reduced physical HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on this vulnerable patient group extends beyond increased mortality risk, and awareness of mental health problems during the pandemic is essential.

There were significant differences (P=0.0005) between antibody titers in normal and diarrheic groups, in which diarrheic group had a higher titer. Total IgG concentration in diarrheic calves (20.86  0.49), their dams (23.48  0.54) and colostrum (33.40  0.50) was less than normal group (P=0.0005).

Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID\\\\19 and influenza virus. A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID\\\\19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID\\\\19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C\\\\reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4  7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients).

Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID\\\\19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID\\\\19 infection only.

As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including for patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pretest probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection.

On oceanic islands, flying-foxes are often the only seed dispersers or pollinators. However, many flying-fox populations are currently in decline, particularly those of insular species, and this has consequences for the ecological services they provide. Knowledge of the drivers and the scale of flying-fox movements is important in determining the ecological roles that flying-foxes play on islands. This information is also useful for understanding the potential long-term consequences for forest dynamics resulting from population declines or extinction, and so can aid in the development of evidence-based ecological management strategies. To these ends, we examined the foraging movements, floral resource use, and social interactions of the Critically Endangered Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis). METHODS Utilization distributions, using movement-based kernel estimates (MBKE) were generated to determine nightly foraging movements of GPS-tracked P. natalis (n = 24). Generalized linear models (GLMs), linear mixed-effect models (LMMs), and Generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMMs) were constructed to explain how intrinsic factors (body mass, skeletal size, and sex) affected the extent of foraging movements. In addition, we identified pollen collected from facial and body swabs of P. natalis (n = 216) to determine foraging resource use. Direct observations (n = 272) of foraging P. natalis enabled us to assess the various behaviors used to defend foraging resources. RESULTS Larger P. natalis individuals spent more time foraging and less time traveling between foraging patches, traveled shorter nightly distances, and had smaller overall foraging ranges than smaller conspecifics. Additionally, larger individuals visited a lower diversity of floral resources. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that smaller P. natalis individuals are the primary vectors of long-distance dispersal of pollen and digested seeds in this species, providing a vital mechanism for maintaining the flow of plant genetic diversity across Christmas Island. Overall, our study highlights the need for more holistic research approaches that incorporate population demographics when assessing a species' ecological services.","output":"Body-size dependent foraging strategies in the Christmas Island flying-fox: implications for seed and pollen dispersal within a threatened island ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organisation has called for a 40% increase in personal protective equipment manufacturing worldwide, recognising that frontline workers need effective protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Current devices suffer from high fit-failure rates leaving significant proportions of users exposed to risk of viral infection. Driven by non-contact, portable, and widely available 3D scanning technologies, a workflow is presented whereby a users face is rapidly categorised using relevant facial parameters. Device design is then directed down either a semi-customised or fully-customised route. Semi-customised designs use the extracted eye-to-chin distance to categorise users in to pre-determined size brackets established via a cohort of 200 participants encompassing 87.5% of the cohort. The users nasal profile is approximated to a Gaussian curve to further refine the selection in to one of three subsets. Flexible silicone provides the facial interface accommodating minor mismatches between true nasal profile and the approximation, maintaining a good seal in this challenging region. Critically, users with outlying facial parameters are flagged for the fully-customised route whereby the silicone interface is mapped to 3D scan data. These two approaches allow for large scale manufacture of a limited number of design variations, currently nine through the semi-customised approach, whilst ensuring effective device fit.

The pathogenesis of the disease is imbalance of / globin chains. The excess of -globin chains will form hemichromes which can damage red blood cell membranes and lead to hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and secondary iron overload. Iron overload in turn can cause complications such as growth retardation, liver cirrhosis, cardiac insufficiency, and aggravate the disease phenotype. In recent decades, genes participating in iron metabolism have been discovered, and the mechanism of iron metabolism in the development of thalassemia has gradually been elucidated. Subsequently, by manipulating the expression of key genes in iron metabolism such as hepcidin and transferrin receptor, researchers have revealed that iron restriction can improve ineffective hematopoiesis and iron overload, which may provide a potential approach for the treatment of thalassemia.

The synthetic index proposed in this study reflects the public open spaces, accessibility and provision of services qualities of the urban context. Besides, this study estimates these advantages through the hedonic prices method, analyzing the residential market. The combined methodology has been applied in detail to three districts located in the Municipality of Milan (Italy). The simultaneous reading of the indices used to spatialise the urban quality levels allows identifying the extrinsic characteristics of the three neighbourhoods analyzed.

In an earlier clinical study, individuals with moderate COVID-19 were treated with either arbidol (ARB) or inhaled interferon (IFN)-2b +/?ARB. IFN treatment resulted in accelerated viral clearance from the upper airways and in a reduction in the circulating levels of the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). We have extended the analysis of this study cohort to determine whether IFN treatment had a direct effect on virus-induced lung abnormalities and also to ascertain whether any clinical or immune parameters are associated with worsening of lung abnormalities. Evidence is provided that IFN-2b treatment limits the development of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19, as assessed by CT images. Clinical predictors associated with worsening of lung abnormalities include low CD8+ T cell numbers, low levels of circulating albumin, high numbers of platelets, and higher levels of circulating interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Notably, in this study cohort, IFN treatment resulted in a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells, lower tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- levels and, as reported earlier, lower IL-6 levels.

Methods: Coagulation proteins levels (antithrombin, prothrombin, factor_XI, factor_XII, and factor_XIII) and CRP were measured in plasma by the ProcartaPlex Panel (Invitrogen) multiplex immunoassay upon diagnosis. Results: We found higher levels of antithrombin, prothrombin, factor XI, factor XII, and factor XIII in asymptomatic/mild and moderate COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. Interestingly, decreased levels of antithrombin and factors XI, XII, and XIII were observed in those patients who eventually developed severe illness. Additionally, survival models showed us that patients with lower levels of these coagulation proteins had an increased risk of death.

An automated respiratory assessment methodology using the pneuRIP device and a machine-learning algorithm was developed. pneuRIP is a noninvasive approach that uses differences between thoracic and abdominal movements (thoracic-abdominal asynchrony) during respiration to assess respiratory status. The technique was evaluated on 17 patients with Morquio (9 females and 8 males) between the ages of 2 and 57 years. The results of the automated technique agreed with the clinical assessment in 16 out of the 17 patients. It was found that the inverse cumulative percentage representation of the time delay between the thorax and abdomen was the most critical variable for accurate evaluation. It was demonstrated that the technique could be successfully used on patients with Morquio who have difficulty breathing with 100% compliance.

Methods: Data from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March to April 2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed. 37 patients received IMV (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission. Results: The 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean +/- SD 123 +/- 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean +/- SD: 140+/- 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR) , lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher PFR prior to CPAP. Discussion: CPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR, RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success.

Ultrastructural examination demonstrated spherical spiked particles in the glomerular capillary endothelium and the presence of tubulo-reticular inclusions suggestive of an active COVID-19 infection within the kidney. The intra-tubular oxalate deposition was considered to be the result of high dose, supplemental Vitamin C used as an immune booster in many patients with COVID - 19 infection in India.

It is well known that humans spend 80% of their time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to three main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent indoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro and micro, to design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours to an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while Transformers capture long term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro mobility, conditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the topological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the current state-of-art models. Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications of WiFiMod - (i) predict high density hot pockets and space utilization for policy making decisions for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic simulation of indoor mobility data to simulate spread of diseases, (iii) design personal assistants. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"WiFiMod: Transformer-based Indoor Human Mobility Modeling using Passive Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused world-wide turmoil in a short period of time, and the infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly.

METHODS: A voluntary survey was sent to 179 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency program directors to distribute to their residents. Questions focused on issues that may have occurred, program's responses, and expectations of programs during the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 507 residents completed the survey, and 10% reported being deployed to do nonorthopaedic-related care, with junior classes being more likely to receive this assignment (P < 0.001). The greatest concern for respondents was the possibility of getting family members sick (mean = 3.89, on scale of 1-5), followed by personally contracting the illness (mean = 3.38). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous changes and novel sources of adversity for the orthopaedic surgery resident. Contrary to popular opinion, most residents are comfortable with the proposition of providing nonorthopaedic care.

In this study, the application of RNA interference (RNAi) for inhibiting the replication of NDV in cell culture by targeting the viral matrix protein gene (M) is described. Two M-specific shRNA-expressing plasmid constructs, named pS(M641) and pS(M827), were evaluated for antiviral activity against the NDV strain NA-1 by cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration and real-time RT-PCR. After 36h of infection, both pS(M641) and pS(M827) reduced virus titers by 79.4- and 31.6-fold, respectively, and they down-regulated mRNA expression levels of the matrix protein gene M by 94.6% and 84.8%, respectively, in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, while only pS(M641) significantly decreased CPE, compared to the control group. These results indicated that the M gene 641 and 827 sites represent potential antiviral therapy targets, and RNAi targeting of the M gene could not only represent an effective treatment in Newcastle disease but also aid as a method for studying the replication of NDV.","output":"Inhibition of Newcastle disease virus replication by RNA interference targeting the matrix protein gene in chicken embryo fibroblasts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the course of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thrombotic phenomena and/or diffuse vascular damage are frequent, and viral elements have been observed within endothelial cells. OBJECTIVES: CD146 + circulating endothelial cells (CD146 + CECs) and their progenitors (CEPs) are increased in cardiovascular, thrombotic, infectious, and cancer diseases. The present study was designed to investigate their kinetics in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We used a validated flow cytometry procedure to enumerate viable and apoptotic CD146 + CECs and CEPs in COVID-19 patients during the course of the disease and in patients who recovered. RESULTS: Viable CEPs per milliliter were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls. Regarding mature CD146 + CECs, in COVID-19 patients, their absolute number was similar to those observed in healthy controls, but the viable/apoptotic CD146 + CEC ratio was significantly different. Both mild and severe COVID-19 patients had significantly less apoptotic CD146 + CECs compared with healthy controls. Patients who recovered had significantly less CD146 + CECs per milliliter when compared with controls as well as to mild and severe COVID-19 patients. A positive correlation was found between the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cellular fraction and apoptotic CEPs per milliliter in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: CD146 + CECs and CEPs might be investigated as candidate biomarkers of endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Circulating endothelial progenitors are increased in COVID-19 patients and correlate with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in severe cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most crises, though difficult and challenging to address, offer opportunities for change and for development of new perspectives or approaches to deal with traditional strategies.

METHODS: We performed a multi-center study in the four largest hospitals designated for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. There are totally 1547 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the study, alcohol consumption and CS history were evaluated among these patients. The epidemiology, laboratory findings and outcomes of patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that COVID-19 patients with a history of CS tend to have more severe outcomes than non-smoking patients. However, alcohol consumption did not reveal significant effects on neither development of severe illness nor death rates in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: CS is a risk factor for developing severe illness and increasing mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The infection itself leads to a broad activation of B-lymphocytes, which in combination with reduced immunosuppression and systemic pro-inflammatory state may possibly lead to an alloimmune response. The main objective of this retrospective single-center study was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on anti-HLA antibody dynamics and development of de novo donor specific antibodies (dnDSA) in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). We also aimed to determine the outcomes of treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) reduction. Methods A cohort of 27 LTRs infected by SARS-CoV-2 was retrospectively analyzed. The median age of LTRs at infection was 45.4 years (IQR 26.8-59.5) and median time between transplantation and infection was 16.8 months (IQR 8.0-56.9). The inclusion criteria were history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and screening for anti-HLA antibodies (Luminex technology, One Lambda) before and after infection (median 84, IQR 29-239 days and median 55, IQR 32-90 days resp.). Results No dnDSA were detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection. De novo class II anti-HLA antibodies with low mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were observed in 1 patient (3.7%) treated with favipiravir and MMF discontinuation without receiving CP. The standard therapeutic regimen consisted of specific antiviral therapy (remdesivir n=15, 55.6%;favipiravir n=12, 44.4%), reduced or discontinued MMF (n=10, 37.0% and n=17, 63.0%, resp.) and administration of CP (n=18, 66.7%) (Table 1). Conclusion In this retrospective study we did not observe a significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, MMF reduction or CP treatment on anti-HLA antibody dynamics and dnDSA incidence in LTRs. Therefore, CP and MMF withdrawal may be considered as safe therapeutic options regarding antibody-mediated rejection in LTRs affected by SARS-CoV-2. Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm the findings.","output":"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Anti-HLA Antibodies and De Novo DSA Incidence in Lung Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As intracellular parasites, viruses depend heavily on host cell structures and their functions to complete their life cycle and produce new viral particles. Viruses utilize or modulate cellular translational machinery to achieve efficient replication; the role of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in viral replication particularly highlights the importance of the ribosome quantity and/or quality in controlling viral protein synthesis. Recently reported studies have demonstrated that ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) and ribosomal proteins (RPs) act as multifaceted regulators in selective translation of viral transcripts. Here we summarize the recent literature on RBFs and RPs and their association with subcellular redistribution, post-translational modification, enzyme catalysis, and direct interaction with viral proteins.

The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells. ACE2, a pivotal component of the renin-angiotensin system, exerts its physiological functions by modulating the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7). We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. Therefore, we believe that apart from droplets and contact transmission, the possibility of mother-to-child and sexual transmission also exists. Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development.

The therapeutic value of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the prognosis of ARDS remains controversial. The aim of this research is studying the impacts of GCs treatment on ARDS patients in ICU. Methods: We retrospectively studied 2,167 ARDS patients whose data were collected from the public eICU Collaborative Research Database, among which 254 patients who received glucocorticoid (GCs) treatment were 1:1 matched by propensity matching analysis (PSM). The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Every oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) measurement before death or ICU discharge was recorded. A joint model (JM) which combined longitudinal sub-model (mixed-effect model) and time-to-event sub-model (Cox regression model) by trajectory functions of PaO2/FiO2 was conducted to determine the effects of GCs treatment on both ICU mortality and PaO2/FiO2 level and further PaO2/FiO2's effect on event status. The marginal structural cox model (MSCM) adjusted the overall PaO2/FiO2 of patients to further validate the results. Results: The result of the survival sub-model showed that GCs treatment was significantly associated with reduced ICU mortality in ARDS patients [HR (95% CI) = 0.642 (0.453, 0.912)], demonstrating that GCs treatment was a protective factor of ICU mortality. In the longitudinal sub-model, GCs treatment was not correlated to the PaO2/FiO2. After adjusted by the JM, the HR of GCs treatment was 0.602 while GCs was still not significantly related to PaO2/FiO2 level. The JM-induced association showed that higher PaO2/FiO2 was a significant protective factor of mortality in ARDS patients and the HR was 0.991 which demonstrated that one level increase of PaO2/FiO2 level decreased 0.9% risk of ICU mortality. MSCM results also show that GCs can improve the prognosis of patients. Conclusion: Rational use of GCs can reduce the ICU mortality of ARDS patients in ICU. In addition to the use of GCs treatment, clinicians should also focus on the shifting trend of PaO2/FiO2 level to provide better conditions for patients' survival.","output":"The Role of Glucocorticoids in the Treatment of ARDS: A Multicenter Retrospective Study Based on the eICU Collaborative Research Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is considerably the biggest global health challenge of this modern era.

Anti-inflammatory therapy reduces mortality but knowledge on the host response at the level of inflamed tissues is incomplete. Methods: We performed targeted proteomic analysis of pulmonary and splenic tissues from 13 fatal cases of COVID-19 that underwent rapid autopsy, and compared to control tissues from cancer resection (lung) and deceased organ donors (spleen). Viral RNA presence was determined by multiplex PCR, and protein was isolated from tissue by phenol extraction. Targeted multiplex immunoassay panels were used for protein detection and quantification. Findings: Pulmonary proteins with increased abundance in COVID-19 included the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant MCP-3, antiviral TRIM21 and pro-thrombotic TYMP. The lung injury markers OSM and EN-RAGE/S100A12 were highly correlated and associated with tissue inflammation severity. Unsupervised clustering of lung proteomes clearly defined two COVID-19 clusters;these differed by viral presence, tissue inflammation severity and illness duration and were annotated early viral and late inflammatory groups. In the spleen, lymphocyte chemotactic factors and CD8A were decreased in COVID-19, with pro-apoptotic factors, B-cell signalling components and macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) all increased. To contextualise our findings, we cross-referenced an existing meta-analysis of host factors in COVID-19 (MAIC). Overlap with a substantial sub-set of factors (including DDX58, OSM, TYMP, IL-18, MCP-3 and CSF-1) was found, with numerous additional proteins also identified by our study.

METHODS: Patients whose orthopaedic restorative surgeries were postponed as well as those within 3 months postoperative completed electronic questionnaires assessing physical health, emotional health, virtual care and access to resources. The EuroQoL-five-dimensional-three level (EQ-5D-3L) was included as a quantitative and standardised measure of general health status. Data were descriptively analysed using means, SD and qualitative measures. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients whose surgeries were postponed completed the survey. Notable findings included that 41.7% of patients reported an increase in their symptoms during the COVID-19-related closures, and 68.7% described a negative impact on their physical health. Furthermore, 62.6% of patients reported that the postponement of their surgery would negatively affect their ability to return to work. A substantial percentage of patients (71.3%) reported that postponement of their surgery had an overall negative impact on their physical and/or emotional health. The mean health state on the EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale (VAS) scale was 69.9 (SD=18.7). A total of 198 patients within 3 months postoperative completed the survey. A majority of patients (69.7%) indicated that COVID-19-related healthcare closures had an overall negative affect on their recovery. One-third of patients (35.4%) stated that they experienced increased symptoms as a direct result of limited postoperative follow-up. Less than half (41.4%) of patients accessed virtual physiotherapy, and only 42.9% of those that did found it to be helpful in some way.

In contrast, time spent exercising significantly declined [1.0 (0.0, 2.3) to 0.0 (0.0, 0.6) h/week], whereas sedentary time increased from 7.8 (6.1, 10.4) to 8.9 (6.8, 11.4) h/day (p < 0.001). The absolute increase in physical activity was 13 (?36, 81) min/day, whereas sedentary behaviour increased by 55 (?72, 186) min/day. CONCLUSION: Despite a small increase in physical activities, the larger increase in sedentary time induced a net reduction in habitual physical activity levels in Dutch CVD patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown. Since a more inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with disease progression and mortality, we encourage CVD patients and their caregivers to explore novel solutions to increase physical activity levels and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Dutch cardiovascular disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potentially useful for patients with COVID-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, possibly through sigma-1 receptor antagonist effect. METHODS: We examined the associations of haloperidol use with intubation or death and time to discharge home among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Assistance Publique-H?pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. In the primary analyses, we compared these two outcomes between patients receiving and not receiving haloperidol using univariate Cox regression models in matched analytic samples based on patient characteristics and other psychotropic medications. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score analyses with inverse probability weighting and multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Of 15,121 adult inpatients with a positive COVID-19 PT-PCR test, 39 patients (0.03%) received haloperidol within the first 48 hours of admission. Over a mean follow-up of 13.8 days (SD = 17.9), 2,024 patients (13.4%) had a primary end-point event and 10,179 patients (77.6%) were discharged home at the time of study end on May 1st. The primary endpoint occurred in 9 patients (23.1%) who received haloperidol and 2,015 patients (13.4%) who did not. The secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 16 patients (61.5%) who received haloperidol and 9,907 patients (85.8%) who did not. There were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.62, p = 0.531) and secondary (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.74 to 2.28, p = 0.355) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Findings from this multicenter observational study suggest that haloperidol use prescribed at a mean dose of 4.5 mg per day (SD = 5.2) for a mean duration of 8.4 days (SD = 7.2) may not be associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to discharge home, among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","output":"Observational study of haloperidol in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this report is to describe the main aspects of sex-related differences in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM), focusing on chemotherapy-induced heart failure (HF) and investigating the possible therapeutic implications and clinical management applications in the era of personalized medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: In cardio-oncology, molecular and multimodality imaging studies confirm that sex differences do exist, affecting the therapeutic cardioprotective strategies and, therefore, the long-term outcomes. Interestingly, compelling evidences suggest that sex-specific characteristics in drug toxicity might predict differences in the therapeutic response, most likely due to the tangled interplay between cancer and HF, which probably share common underlying mechanisms. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular diseases show many sex-related differences in prevalence, etiology, phenotype expression, and outcomes. Complex molecular mechanisms underlie this diverse pathological manifestations, from sex-determined differential gene expression to sex hormone interaction with their receptors in the heart. Non-ischemic DCM is an umbrella definition that incorporates several etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathies. The role of sex as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity is poorly explored. However, understanding the various features of disease manifestation and outcomes is of paramount importance for a prompt and tailored evaluation.","output":"Sex-Related Differences in Dilated Cardiomyopathy with a Focus on Cardiac Dysfunction in Oncology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a programme of care offered to people who recently experienced a cardiac event. There is a growing focus on home-based formats of CR and a lack of evidence on preferences for psychological care in CR. This pilot study aimed to investigate preferences for delivery attributes of a psychological therapy intervention in CR patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted and recruited participants from a feasibility trial. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical interventions, described using five attributes; intervention type (home or centre-based), information provided, therapy manual format, cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and waiting time. A separate opt-out was included. A conditional logit using maximum likelihood estimation was used to analyse preferences. The NHS cost was used to estimate willingness to pay for aspects of the intervention delivery. RESULTS: 35 responses were received (39% response rate). Results indicated that participants would prefer to receive any form of therapy compared with no therapy. Statistically significant results were limited, but included participants being keen to avoid not receiving information prior to therapy (=?0.270; p=0.03) and preferring a lower cost to the NHS (=?0.001; p=0.00). No significant results were identified for the type of psychological intervention, format of therapy/exercises and programme start time. Coefficients indicated preferences were stronger for home-based therapy compared with centre-based, but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a DCE in this group, it identifies potential attributes and levels, and estimates the sample sizes needed for a full study. Preliminary evidence indicated that sampled participants tended to prefer home-based psychological therapy in CR and wanted to receive information before initiating therapy.

METHODS: We performed an anonymous survey of AC participants and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) adult reconstruction fellows. Participants were polled with regards to educational tools used before and after COVID-19 and their value. Specifically, participation in the AC, AAHKS FOCAL (Fellows Orthopedic Continued AAHKS Learning) lectures, institutional lectures, industry lectures, textbooks, online videos, journal articles, and webinars was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven participants responded with 49 (86%) at the fellow level. There was an increase in the use of web-based learning, including the AC (Not applicable pre, 61% post), AAHKS FOCAL lectures (Not applicable pre, 82% post), industry lectures (53% pre, 86% post), and AAHKS/AAOS webinars (35% pre, 56% post). Usage declined with institutional lectures (89% pre, 80% post), textbooks (68% pre, 49% post), and journal articles (97% pre, 90% post), with minimal change in the use of online surgical videos (84% pre, 82% post).

We investigated the effects of school reopening and easing of social distancing restrictions on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Israel, between March-July 2020. METHODS: We examined the nationwide agewise weekly incidence, prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, their positivity, COVID-19 hospitalizations and associated mortality. Temporal differences in these parameters following school reopening, school ending, and following easing of restrictions such as permission of large scale gatherings, were examined. RESULTS: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections gradually increased following school reopening in all age groups, with a significantly higher increase in adults compared to children. Higher relative ratios (RRs) of sample positivity rates 21-27 days following school reopening relative to positivity rates prior to openings were found for the age groups 40-59 (RR: 4.72, 95% CI: 3.26 - 6.83) and 20-39 years (RR: 3.37 [2.51 - 4.53]), but not for children aged 0-9 (RR: 1.46 [0.85 - 2.51]) and 10-19 years (RR: 0.93 [0.65 - 1.34]).No increase was observed in COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths following school reopening. In contrast, permission of large-scale gatherings was accompanied by increases in incidence and positivity rates of samples for all age groups, and increased hospitalizations and mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the admission CXR of 327 patients accessed to our institute during the Italian pandemic descending phase (April 2020). For each CXR were searched ground glass opacification (GGO), consolidation (CO), reticular-nodular opacities (RNO), nodules, excavations, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, vascular congestion and cardiac enlargement. For lung alterations was defined the predominance (upper or basal, focal or diffuse, central or peripheric, etc.). Then radiologists assessed whether CXRs were suggestive or not for COVID-19 infection. For COVID-19 patients, a prognostic score was applied and correlated with the patients' outcome. RESULTS: CXR showed 83% of specificity and 60% of sensitivity. GGO, CO, RNO and a peripheric, diffuse and basal prevalence showed good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis pointed out GGO and a basal or diffuse distribution as independent predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis. The prognostic score showed good correlation with the patients' outcome. CONCLUSION: In our study, admission CXR showed a fair specificity and a good correlation with patients' outcome. GGO and others CXR findings showed a good correlation with COVID-19 diagnosis; besides GGO a diffuse or bibasal distribution resulted in independent variables highly suggestive for COVID-19 infection thus enabling radiologists to signal to clinicians radiologically suspect patients during the pandemic descending phase.","output":"Chest X-ray in the emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic descending phase in Italy: correlation with patients' outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this editorial is to illustrate the new public funding framework of the Italian National Health System following the Covid-19 pandemic.

This typically involves a preoperative symptom screen and nasal swab RT-PCR test for viral RNA. Asymptomatic patients with a negative COVID-19 test are cleared for surgery. However, little is known about the rate of postoperative COVID-19 positivity among elective surgical patients, risk factors for this group and rate of complications. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study included all patients undergoing elective surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. Patients were divided into groups based on first positive COVID-19 test within 30 days after surgery (COVID[-/+]), before surgery (COVID[+/-]) or negative throughout (COVID[-/-]). The cumulative incidence, risk factors for and complications of COVID[-/+], were estimated using univariate analysis, exact matching, and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Between March 1 and December 1, 2020 90,093 patients underwent elective surgery. Of these, 60,853 met inclusion criteria, of which 310 (0.5%) were in the COVID[-/+] group. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression identified female sex, end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cancer, cirrhosis, and undergoing neurosurgical procedures as risk factors for being in the COVID[-/+] group. After matching on current procedural terminology code and month of procedure, multivariable Poisson regression estimated the complication rate ratio for the COVID[-/+] group vs. COVID[-/-] to be 8.4 (C.I. 4.9-14.4) for pulmonary complications, 3.0 (2.2, 4.1) for major complications, and 2.6 (1.9, 3.4) for any complication. DISCUSSION: Despite preoperative COVID-19 screening, there remains a risk of COVID infection within 30 days after elective surgery. This risk is increased for patients with a high comorbidity burden and those undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Higher intensity preoperative screening and closer postoperative monitoring is warranted in such patients because they have a significantly elevated risk of postoperative complications.","output":"Increased complications in patients who test COVID-19 positive after elective surgery and implications for pre and postoperative screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent medical literature suggests that vitamin D supplementation protects against acute respiratory tract infection.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332).

Prompt diagnosis of GAS can improve the quality of patient care and minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop an alternative nucleic acid amplification method for the diagnosis of GAS. METHOD: We developed and evaluated a strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) assay to rapidly and specifically detect GAS. The performance of the developed GAS SIBA assay was compared with an established GAS polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: The GAS SIBA assay detected small amounts (ten copies) of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min. The rapid detection time was achieved in part by optimization of magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The sensitivity and specificity of the GAS SIBA assay for detection of S. pyogenes from clinical specimens were both 100%, and clinical specimens were detected within ~ 8 min of starting the reaction. CONCLUSION: Because the GAS SIBA assay is performed at low and constant temperature, it can be used both in centralized laboratories and for point-of-care testing.

No severe or serious AEs, medically attended AEs (MAAEs) or AEs of special interest (AESI) were reported during the study period and all the reported AEs resolved without any sequelae. In both pediatric age groups, CORBEVAX vaccinated subjects showed significant improvement in humoral immune-responses in terms of anti-RBD-IgG concentrations, anti-RBD-IgG1 titers, neutralizing antibody (nAb)-titers against Ancestral Wuhan and Delta strains. Significantly high interferon gamma immune response (cellular) was elicited by CORBEVAX vaccinated subjects with minimal effect on IL-4 cytokine secretion. Interpretations: The safety profile of CORBEVAX vaccine in 17 to 5 years children and adolescents was found to be safe and tolerable. The adverse event profile was also found to be acceptable. Significant increase in anti-RBD IgG and nAb titers and IFN-gamma immune responses were observed post vaccination in both pediatric age sub groups. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were found to be non-inferior to the immune responses induced by CORBEVAX vaccine in adult population. This study shows that CORBEVAX vaccine is highly immunogenic and can be safely administered to pediatric population as young as 5 years old.","output":"Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Biological Es CORBEVAX vaccine in children and adolescents: A Prospective, Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Phase-2/3 Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many novel drugs were used in COVID19 pandemic to improve outcome.

While it is challenging to meet the rapidly growing demand for bandwidth to support supply chain applications in the Blockchain era, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered bandwidth demand surges across all online services such as the internet, content delivery, e-platforms, and social media. A sudden demand surge may impel users to lose their access or have a poor online experience due to bandwidth throttling by their Online Service Providers (OSPs). Earlier work on optimal throttling mechanism under stochastic demand has overlooked such demand surges. In this paper, we recast the user demand to adequately capture the demand surges, such as home bandwidth demand surges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we model the user demand as a geometric Lvy (jumpCdiffusion) process. Within our general setting, we show that it is optimal for the OSP to follow a modified control-band policy that encompasses the existing results as a special case. Our numerical study not only enhances the current insights about the optimal throttling mechanism by including demand surges but also provides new insights concerning the nature of demand surges. For example, our study suggests that OSPs should initiate demand throttling at relatively lower usage levels if the likelihood of having demand surges is high;furthermore, we find that when OSPs are exposed to demand surges with higher intensities, it is optimal for them to wait until the usage level reaches a relatively high level before throttling it.","output":"Managing surges in online demand using bandwidth throttling: An optimal strategy amid the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the effectiveness of evoking other-oriented emotions in vaccine messages to promote vaccine advocacy behaviors.

Because the course of the disease is often erratic and varies between patients, it is imperative for patients with ALS to be closely monitored. E-health innovations that can monitor disease progression remotely have great potential to tailor the care to the needs of individual patients with ALS. Therefore, the e-health innovation ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching was developed employing a user-centered design process and implemented at the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands in 2017. Because ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching was shown to be feasible and well received by patients and healthcare professionals at University Medical Centre Utrecht, we aim to implement this e-health innovation nationwide, starting with 10 ALS care teams in different rehabilitation settings spread across the Netherlands. METHODS: This research focuses on the implementation process and the user experiences with ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching of both patients and healthcare professionals. We will use a participatory action research approach, with the stakeholders involved in all stages of the implementation process. The implementation process model of Grol and Wensing was used to structure and support planning, execution and evaluation of the implementation strategy. The expected barriers and facilitators will be explored and identified in focus group settings using the Theoretical Domains Framework. After that, each team will develop their own action plan with strategies for how to resolve each barrier. The teams will include 5-10 ALS patients with whom they will test their implementation plan and provide care with ALS Home-monitoring and Coaching for approximately 3 months. Afterwards, the implementation and the user experiences will be evaluated with digital surveys based on the evaluation framework of Proctor (e.g., acceptability, adoption, appropriateness). DISCUSSION: Using implementation theories, this study will provide inside in factors influencing implementation outcomes and strategies that can be used to overcome barriers. This will enhance our understanding of how to successfully implement e-health innovations in multidisciplinary care in rehabilitation settings.

BACKGROUND Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. DESIGN Cross-sectional online survey. METHODS A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. RESULTS Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.","output":"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: CKD is common in heart failure (HF) and associated with morbidity and mortality, yet life-prolonging medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) are underused due to risk of hyperkalaemia. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a potassium-binding medication that has been shown to reduce incidence of hyperkalaemia in CKD, non-CKD, and HF populations, which we propose will support maximisation of RAASi therapy. METHODS: We propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants will receive either SZC or placebo. We will up-titrate participants RAASi therapy while monitoring their serum potassium levels and adjusting their SZC dose if necessary. Participants with CKD and HF will be recruited from CKD and HF clinics at St Georges Hospital. The total study period will be 18 months; 130 participants will be enrolled for approximately two months each following screening. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who achieve maximum RAASi dose while maintaining normokalaemia. Secondary outcomes include participants reaching maximum RAASi dose without severe hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to severe hyperkalaemia; number of RAASi dose escalations per participant; final doses of RAASi therapy; changes in quality of life score, eGFR, ACR, serum sodium, troponin T; number and duration of hospital admissions; and within-participant change in serum potassium compared to baseline. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first to examine the use of SZC for the maximisation of RAASi dosing in patients with advanced CKD and HF. We will assess the impact of achieving target RAASi dosing on hospital admission rates and duration of stay, with the hope that optimum RAASi treatment will translate into reduced morbidity and improved QoL.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged  12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18C30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower.

This survey aims to evaluate contemporary practice for managing CLTI in the UK. METHODS A questionnaire was developed in conjunction with the VSGBI to survey the management of CLTI and canvass opinions on the PAD QIF. The survey was distributed to all consultant members of the VSGBI and through a targeted social media campaign. RESULTS Forty-seven consultant vascular surgeons based at 36 arterial centres across the UK responded (response rate from arterial centres = 46%). Only 14.3% of centres provided outpatient consultation within the target of seven days from referral, with only one centre providing revascularisation within the target of seven days from consultation. For inpatient management, 31.6% provided surgical and 23.8% endovascular revascularisation within the target of three days from assessment. While 60% of participants believe the PAD QIF's 5-day 'admitted care' pathway is achievable, only 28.6% thought the 14-day 'non-admitted care' pathway was feasible. Challenges to meeting these targets include the availability of theatre space and angiography lists, and availability of outpatient appointments for patient assessment. CONCLUSIONS The opinion of UK vascular surgeons indicates that achieving the targets of the PAD QIF represents a major challenge based upon current services.

Moreover, in Italy, the government banned all non-essential travel across the entire country from the beginning of March. Consequently, Italian cyclists were banned from leaving their homes and therefore unable to perform their ordinary training activities. The Italian Association of Professional Cyclists (ACCPI) early on during that period noticed that several cyclists were experiencing a worrying decrease in their mental well-being and asked the authors to set up an online Sport Psychology Intervention (SPI) during lockdown to enhance the athletes' mental health. Through a number of unprecedented events and considerations, the aim of the current investigation was to assess the Italian cyclists' mental health during the lockdown and its changes after the SPI. We validated the Italian version of the Sport Mental Health Continuum Short Form (Sport MHC-SF)presented in Study 1and then applied it to a sample of Italian professional cyclistspresented in Study 2prior to and after the SPI. To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the Sport MHC-SF were tested in Study 1. RM-MANOVA tests were run to evaluate the effect of SPI on cyclists in Study 2. A total of 185 Italian athletes were involved in the validation of the MHC in Study 1 and 38 professional cyclists in Study 2. Results from Study 1 suggested a three-factor higher order model of Sport MHC-SF [Model fit: (2)(df) = 471.252 (252), p < 0.000; CFI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.049; RMR= 0.048]. MCFA showed that the default model kept invariance among groups of athletes (i.e., female, male, individual, and team sports). Results from Study 2 highlighted that professional cyclists who followed the SPI were able to cope better with psychological stressors, showing improved well-being compared to the athletes that did not. No significant differences were found for emotional and social well-being. The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of Sport MHC-SF translated in the Italian language and culture. It also provides practical implications related to cases of reduced mental health due to injury, illness, or similar situations of home confinement in the future.","output":"How Does a Sport Psychological Intervention Help Professional Cyclists to Cope With Their Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Gastroparesis is a life-altering diagnosis caused by the stomach's inability to function in the absence of a mechanical obstruction. The primary causes are idiopathic, diabetic, and postoperative. Our first-line treatment for medical refractory gastroparesis is the endoscopic per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) procedure. Predicting clinical response cost effectively remains elusive. METHODS All patients who underwent a POP procedure at our institution by a single surgical endoscopist from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. All endoscopic data were prospectively collected. The patients were followed by a survey including the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and other relevant postoperative measures. The primary endpoint was clinical response defined as  1.0 decrease in the GCSI from preoperative to the time of survey. Secondary outcome was normalization of the gastric emptying study (GES). RESULTS Our patient population is 85% female and has an average age of 44.8 years. The diagnosis of gastroparesis is 71% iatrogenic, 19% postoperative, and 10% diabetic. On endoscopy, 30% had bile in the stomach and 65% had any degree of pylorospasm. The primary outcome measure of clinical response was 39% at an average of 697  151 days post-POP, but 66% of patients attested to an improvement in their symptoms. Of 68 postoperative gastric emptying studies 50% normalized at an average of 145  98 days. Following univariate and multivariate analyses of preoperative data and endoscopic findings, there were no significant predictors of clinical response. A preoperative GCSI  2.6 trends toward significance (OR 6.87, p = 0.058). CONCLUSION Endoscopic findings at the time of POP do not correlate with clinical response. The GCSI model currently used to measure clinical response may not accurately capture the full clinical picture. The long-term durability of endoscopic myotomy to treat medical refractory gastroparesis needs to be studied further to improve patient selection.","output":"Endoscopic findings do not predict per-oral pyloromyotomy (POP) response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational prediction of Protein-Ligand Interaction (PLI) is an important step in the modern drug discovery pipeline as it mitigates the cost, time, and resources required to screen novel therapeutics. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in PLI prediction. However, the performance is highly dependent on protein and ligand features utilized for the DNN model. Moreover, in current models, the deciphering of how protein features determine the underlying principles that govern PLI is not trivial. In this work, we developed a DNN framework named SSnet that utilizes secondary structure information of proteins extracted as the curvature and torsion of the protein backbone to predict PLI. We demonstrate the performance of SSnet by comparing against a variety of currently popular machine and non-Machine Learning (ML) models using various metrics. We visualize the intermediate layers of SSnet to show a potential latent space for proteins, in particular to extract structural elements in a protein that the model finds influential for ligand binding, which is one of the key features of SSnet. We observed in our study that SSnet learns information about locations in a protein where a ligand can bind, including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used. We further observed that SSnet is not biased to any specific molecular interaction and extracts the protein fold information critical for PLI prediction. Our work forms an important gateway to the general exploration of secondary structure-based Deep Learning (DL), which is not just confined to protein-ligand interactions, and as such will have a large impact on protein research, while being readily accessible for de novo drug designers as a standalone package.","output":"SSnet: A Deep Learning Approach for Protein-Ligand Interaction Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radix of Isatis indigotica (indigowood root, IR) has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory effect.

A total of 57 BALB/c mice were randomized into six treatment groups: control, IR treatment (0.195, 0.585 and 1.170 g/kg, p.o. daily), L-glutamine (0.520 g/kg) and sham group. All mice except the sham group were irradiated and then administered for one week. The radioprotective effect on hematopoietic system, serum cytokines, and intestinal toxicity was studied. Protective effects on spleen and thymus are found in IR-treated groups. IR assisted in restoration of leukocytopenia after whole mice irradiation with significant reduction of serum TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6. These enhancements of hematopoietic effects are due to an increase in the serum G-CSF concentration in IR treated groups. In histopathological assessment, significant improvement of intestine toxicity is observed in high-dose IR and L-glutamine group. Evidences show that IR has potentials to be a radioprotector, especially in recovery of hematopoietic system, reduction of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal toxicity.

Current influenza virus vaccine modalities primarily induce antibodies directed towards the highly variable head domain of the hemagglutinin protein on the virus surface. Such antibodies are often strain-specific, meaning limited cross-protection against divergent influenza viruses is induced, resulting in poor vaccine efficacy. To attempt to counteract this, yearly influenza vaccination with updated formulations containing antigens from more recently circulating viruses is required. This is an expensive and time-consuming exercise, and the constant arms race between host immunity and virus evolution presents an ongoing challenge for effective vaccine development. Furthermore, there exists the constant pandemic threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with high fatality rates (~30C50%) or the emergence of new, pathogenic reassortants. Current vaccines would likely offer little to no protection from such viruses in the event of an epidemic or pandemic. This highlights the urgent need for improved influenza virus vaccines capable of providing long-lasting, robust protection from both seasonal influenza virus infections as well as potential pandemic threats.

This study examines the prevalence and factors associated with shortages of NH staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: We obtained self-reported information on staff shortages, resident and staff exposure to COVID-19, and PPE availability from a survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in May 2020. Multivariate logistic regressions of staff shortages with state fixed-effects were conducted to examine the effect of COVID-19 factors in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 11,920 free-standing NHs. MEASURES: The dependent variables were self-reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other ancillary staff. We controlled for NH characteristics from the most recent Nursing Home Compare and Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, market characteristics from Area Health Resources File, and state Medicaid reimbursement calculated from Truven data. RESULTS: Of the 11,920 NHs, 15.9%, 18.4%, 2.5%, and 9.8% reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other staff, respectively. Georgia and Minnesota reported the highest rates of shortages in licensed nurse and nurse aides (both >25%). Multivariate regressions suggest that shortages in licensed nurses and nurse aides were more likely in NHs having any resident with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44, 1.60, respectively) and any staff with COVID-19 (AOR = 1.37, 1.34, respectively). Having 1-week supply of PPE was associated with lower probability of staff shortages. NHs with a higher proportion of Medicare residents were less likely to experience shortages. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Abundant staff shortages were reported by NHs and were mainly driven by COVID-19 factors. In the absence of appropriate staff, NHs may be unable to fulfill the requirement of infection control even under the risk of increased monetary penalties.","output":"Shortages of Staff in Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: What are the Driving Factors?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteroides fragilis is an obligate anaerobe and a common gut commensal bacterium that is also an important opportunistic pathogen.

ACE2 (FC = +1.88, p  0.05) and DPP4 (FC = +3, p < 0.01) genes showed a significant overexpression in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 and DPP4 expression levels had a good performance (AUC = 0.75; p < 0.001) in distinguishing COVID-19 patients from negative subjects.

All primary presentations with acute stroke or AMI during the first 28 days of Stage 2 and 3 SOE restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2020) were compared to an equivalent period without restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2019). The primary outcome variable was time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation. RESULTS: There were 52 (1.6% of all ED presentations) patients that met inclusion criteria during the SOE period and 57 (1.0%) patients in the comparator period. Patients were equally matched for demographics, disease severity and prior history of stroke or AMI. Median time from symptom onset to presentation was 227 (93\\\\1183) mins during the SOE period and 342 (119\\\\1220) mins during the comparator period (p=0.24).

METHODS: The research was developed with the Fulni-? people in the municipality of guas Belas, Agreste of Pernambuco, Northeast of Brazil. In order to do this, we applied snowball sampling to select the participants. Data from potentially useful game species were obtained from lists and semi-structured interviews to register their particular kind of uses, capture periods (daytime, night, or both), preferences, and perceived abundance. The hunters who allowed their game meat captured to be weighed and identified were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Our records pointed to a vast repertoire of potentially hunting animals. However, we did not verify relationships between the abundance, seasonality, and biomass of the animals that were hunted by the Fulni-?. We observed a total of 209,866 (kg) of game meat hunted in the studied group, belonging to 23 species, distributed in three taxonomic groups, the birds being the most representative group with 59% of total reported. CONCLUSION: Such consumption by the group is well below in terms of biomass when compared to other ethnic or local groups in other regions of Brazil, or in Caatinga areas, characterizing an activity much more of cultural character than subsistence. Also, the use of game meat among the Fulni-? seems to be actively directed to the preferred species, suggesting that in the case of an urbanized indigenous community, where other sources of income are available, the demand for game meat is lower when compared to other ethnic groups.","output":"Use of game fauna by Fulni-? people in Northeastern Brazil: implications for conservation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Prolonged lockdown in our country provided us with a unique opportunity to study the interplay of psychosocial impact on pain in surgically treated patients of chronic pancreatitis Methods Forty-one patients who underwent surgery for chronic pancreatitis in the last 24 months were followed up, of which 27 were enrolled The data were collected telephonically Pain was assessed using the numeric pain rating (NPR) scale and depression using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9 In patients having recent onset pain during the lockdown, oral tramadol 50 mg and amitryptiline 25 mg were prescribed and reassessed after two weeks Results Of the 25 pain-free patients in February (pre-lockdown), 14 developed pain of varying intensity during the lockdown and were prescribed medications Twelve out of 14 patients had very good resolution of pain after two weeks of medication Conclusions Operated patients with chronic pancreatitis who developed new-onset depression and pain responded well to low-dose anti-depressants in addition to analgesics This study gives indirect, objective evidence that covert depression leading to pain in chronic pancreatitis is often downplayed and interpreted as poor results of surgery","output":"Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Has It Given Us a New Dimension for Treatment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started in Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019, and then increased rapidly.

Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. METHODS: We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. RESULTS: We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children.

Our aim was to investigate the vaccination status, vaccination card knowledge and the vaccination behavior of MS patients with regard to vaccinations against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and poliomyelitis. Three hundred twenty-seven patients with MS were evaluated by anamnesis, clinical examination, structured interview and vaccination card control in this two-center study. Based on the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute, we assessed the completeness of the vaccination status of the examined vaccinations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of patients with complete/incomplete or correctly/wrongly self-reported vaccination status was performed. In the cohort analyzed, the vaccination coverage was 79.5% for tetanus, 79.2% for diphtheria, 74.8% for pertussis and 84.8% for poliomyelitis. The assumed vaccination status was higher for tetanus (86.5%) and lower for diphtheria (69.4%), pertussis (61.2%) and poliomyelitis (75.9%). Patients who were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated against tetanus had received vaccination advice from a physician less often in the past year (13.4 vs. 36.9%, p < 0.001) and had no one to check the vaccination card more often (35.8 vs. 12.3%, p < 0.001). High sensitivity (93.7%) and low specificity (30.3%) were determined regarding the validity of self-reported tetanus vaccination status. Patients with a correctly reported tetanus vaccination status were more likely to have their vaccination card checked by a physician than those who overestimated or underestimated their vaccination status (76.7 vs. 63.0/43.8%, p = 0.002). Similar findings were seen with regard to diphtheria, pertussis and poliomyelitis vaccination.

In efforts to increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of COVID-19 screening, we evaluated the feasibility of pooling clinical Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens during nucleic acid extraction without a reduction in sensitivity of qRT-PCR. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and subsequently tested by qRT-PCR according to the WHO-Charit protocol. We demonstrated that the sample pooling method showed no loss of sensitivity. The effectiveness of the pooled testing strategy was evaluated on both retrospective and prospective samples, and the results showed a similar detection sensitivity compared to testing individual sample alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a pooled testing strategy to increase testing capacity and conserve resources, especially when there is a high demand for disease testing.","output":"A novel strategy for community screening of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): Sample pooling method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the mediating and moderating effects of competitive advantage and access to working capital, respectively, on the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and informal microenterprise economic performance in Senegal from the lens of resource-based view theory (RBV) Data were randomly gathered using the cross-sectional research design from 356 informal micro-entrepreneurs operating in the informal sector The study outcomes revealed that entrepreneurial competencies and competitive advantage emerged as significant predictors of economic performance for informal microenterprises in Senegal On the contrary, access to working capital displayed an adverse moderating effect, while competitive advantage exhibited a partial and positive mediating effect on the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and economic performance of informal microenterprises The Important and Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) results signify that the most significant considerations for the economic performance of informal microenterprises in Senegal were competitive advantage, access to working capital, commitment competency, and relationship competency Simultaneously, this study expanded the reach of RBV by enhancing our understanding pertaining to the mediating and moderating roles in the relationships among entrepreneurial competencies, competitive advantage, and access to working capital towards improving the economic performance of informal microenterprises across developing countries Since many have lost their jobs due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of Senegal and its policymakers should place more emphasis on the importance of informal entrepreneurship, such as provision of low-interest credit facilities for their working capital, as well as thorough training in the strategic advantage and competencies domains This is because informal entrepreneurs have the ability, via jobs creation and income generating activities, to contribute to the economic growth of the country","output":"Competitive Advantages of the Relationship between Entrepreneurial Competencies and Economic Sustainability Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telework has been promoted for decades as one of the traffic demand management policies to alleviate congestion during peak periods and reduce work-related trips, along with other benefits. However, less clear is the role played by life stages (i.e., gender, marital status and parenthood) on telework behavior. This study investigated to which extent telework frequency associated with life stages, and how these associations could be explained based on the work-life conflict perspective. Representative data were obtained from German Microcensus 2010 (N = 188,081 participants). The outcome variable was measured as ordered telework participation levels (i.e., never, infrequently and frequently). After testing for multicollinearity, a zero-inflated ordered probit regression model was applied to assess the associations between telework and family-life stages, while adjusting for individual, household, job-related and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that life stages associate with telework behavior in a complex way. Three patterns have been distinguished. Specifically, irrespective of gender and marital status, parents are less likely to telework compared to those without children. Regarding individuals without children, single individuals are more likely to telework than married ones, and males more likely than females. In contrast, for individuals with children, the partnered parents are more likely to telework than single parents, and females more likely than males. Our findings suggest that as the most important feature in family-life stages, children play a vital role in telework behavior. It not only increases both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, but also triggers housework re-division within couples and aggravates gender differences. Policies that support formal childcare resources could relieve the family-to-work conflict and encourage people to work at home.","output":"A work-life conflict perspective on telework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are at an increased risk for diaper dermatitis, which can cause skin breakdown and lead to significant pain and potential infection exposure. Skin care protocols in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting seldom specifically address the needs of this at-risk population, leading to inconsistent skin care management. PURPOSE The goal was to support a decrease in the rate of diaper dermatitis for infants with NAS by designing and implementing an evidence-based skin care protocol. METHODS A retrospective medical record review was used to examine outcomes of 25 infants preintervention and 8 infants postintervention. The skin care protocol was a bundle of 5 evidence-based interventions: (1) a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool; (2) frequent diaper changes with superabsorbent diapers; (3) application of petroleum jelly and alcohol-free wipes; (4) infant bathing in pH neutral soap; and (5) application of zinc oxide barrier cream for erythema. RESULTS There was an overall 80.5% decrease in diaper dermatitis from pre- to postimplementation (P  .01) as noted when comparing positive cases of diaper dermatitis with negative cases from pre- to postintervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Expanding the skin care protocol to all neonates in the NICU and nursery could aid in maintaining skin integrity and decreasing diaper dermatitis in the NICU. More research is needed following this study for the data to be generalizable to other NICUs. This study offers key takeaways including using a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool and consistently using the bundle of interventions.Video Abstract Available at:https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx?autoPlay=false&videoId=47.","output":"Designing and Implementing a Skin Care Protocol for Infants With Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome to Decrease Rates of Diaper Dermatitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human astroviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes.

Over the past decades, significant investments have been made in global health leadership development programs by governments and philanthropic organizations to address this need. Evaluating the societal impact of these programs remains challenging, despite consensus on the importance of public health leadership. OBJECTIVE: This article identifies the gaps and highlights the critical role of monitoring and evaluation approaches in assessing the impact of global health leadership programs. Importantly, we also propose the theory of change (TOC) as a common framework and identify a set of tools and indicators that leadership programs can adapt and use. METHODS: We carried out an informal review of major global health leadership programs, including a literature review on leadership program evaluation approaches. Current practices in assessing the short- to long-term outcomes of leadership training programs were explored and synthesized. We also examined use of program theory frameworks, such as theory of change to guide the evaluation strategy. We find the TOC approach can be enhanced by integrating evaluation-specific frameworks and establishing broad stakeholder buy-in. We highlight measurement challenges, proposed outcome indicators and evaluation methodologies, and outline the future direction for such efforts. FINDINGS: Most evaluation of current leadership programs is focused on short-term individual-level outcomes, while reports on long-term societal impact were limited. Reciprocal impacts on and benefits for the host organizations were not included in evaluation metrics. Most programs had program logic or result chains, but with no well-articulated program theories. CONCLUSION: Key stakeholders involved in leadership training programs benefit from the evidence of rigorous program evaluations to inform decisions that address barriers in fostering global health leadership and improving population health outcomes. Insight into reciprocal change in host organizations is important. Evaluation of global health leadership training must go beyond the individual trainee and encompass organizational and community-level impacts. Documentation of long-lasting organizational and societal impacts is essential for donors to appreciate the return on their investment. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Evaluation plays an important role in understanding how leadership development takes place and how it contributes to improving public health outcomes. Making the case for investments in leadership development programs requires robust evidence from monitoring and evaluation strategies that link investments beyond the individual-level to longer-term societal impacts. The first critical step towards a strategy for success is for leadership programs to clearly build, articulate, share, and use their program theories or theories of change. Theories of change help identify the pathways (and potential tensions) through which leadership development programs effect change at the individual, organizational and community levels. Evaluation methods that examine outcomes of leadership programs should be multi-method, multi-level, and where possible include counterfactual outcomes. Allocation of funds to evaluate on-going and long-lasting societal impact of leadership programs should be a routine practice.","output":"Measuring for Success: Evaluating Leadership Training Programs for Sustainable Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutbacks in government spending slowed the recovery and led to lasting damage to workers and economic growth.","output":"COVID-19 Is Transforming Economic Policy in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has created havoc around the globe since it first started infecting humans in December 2019. It has not only created a significant health and economic crisis for the world but also caused unusual individual behaviours such as panic buying all around the world. At the outset, the rationality behind these abnormal behaviours is hard to explain as such behaviours are naturally irrational. Thus, this study attempted to explain individual behaviours observed in various countries through the theoretical lens of several established behavioural theories to make a recommendation for changing peoples behaviour during a future pandemic. Taking a quantitative approach with a comprehensive review of recent literature and using secondary data from online sources, the study analysed peoples behaviours in numerous countries using several behavioural theories. The study found that excessive information, sometimes rumours and misinformation, circulated through social and news media had played a significant role in the unprecedented panic buying observed around the world. As explained in behavioural theories, during a pandemic, people are compelled to make quick decisions and to take actions to subside their negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety so that they feel better and safe. In doing so, people use their heuristics or mental shortcuts which leads to panic buying behaviours. More specifically, the behaviours such as affect heuristic, availability heuristic, loss aversion, regret aversion, risk aversion, framing, hoarding, herding and bandwagon effect had primarily contributed to the panic buying occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, based on the findings, the study made several recommendations to stakeholders so that they would be able to make people better prepared for a future pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and Panic Buying: An Examination of the Impact of Behavioural Biases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluation for the controlling policy's effectiveness to mitigate criteria air pollutants (CAPs) in South Korea during December 1, 2019-March 31, 2020 is difficult because of its coincidence with the COVID-19 social distancing. In this study, we differentiated the influence of three major driving factors (intensive controlling policy by the government, meteorological conditions, and social distancing) to the CAP variation in Ulsan, the largest industrial city in South Korea. In 2013-2019, the concentrations of PM2.5 (2015-2019), PM10, SO2, and NO2 decreased by 6.7, 1.6, 4.2, and 3.3%/year, respectively, whereas the O3 concentration slightly increased by 0.7%/year. Trend analysis was used to predict the CAP concentrations before (January 1-February 21) and during (February 22-March 31) the social distancing in 2020. The difference between the measured and predicted concentrations was designated as the contribution of the three factors. The controlling policy was the most important driver of the CAP reductions. In particular, its contributions were 94.1% (January 1-February 21) and 87.4% (February 22-March 31) to the PM2.5 decrease. The change in meteorological conditions considerably affected the CAP reductions, with the highest contributions of 35.2% (January 1-February 21) and 39.2% (February 22-March 31) to the O3 decrease. On February 22-March 31, the effects of social distancing were 1.6, 0.6, 1.3, and 1.4% to the reduction of SO2, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, respectively.

The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial.

It has been reported that older adults and those with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are prone to develop severe disease and poorer outcomes. By virtue of their average old age, multiple comorbidities, immunosuppression and frequent contact with other patients in dialysis facilities, chronic HD patients are at particular risk for severe COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to compare clinical presentation, laboratory and radiologic data and outcomes between HD and non-HD COVID-19 patients and find possible risk factors for mortality on HD patients. METHOD: A single center retrospective cohort study including patients on HD hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, from March 1st to December 31st of 2020 and matched them to non-dialysis patients (non-HD) (1:1). Data regarding patient baseline characteristics, symptoms, laboratory and radiologic results at presentation were collected, as well as their outcomes. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means or medians for variables with skewed distributions. A paired Students t-test was performed on parametric continuous values or Mann-Whitney for non-parametric continuous variables. Chi-squared test was performed for comparing categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for mortality on HD patients. A p-value of less than 0,05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients HD patients were included, 70,6% male, mean age of 76,5 years, median time of dialysis of 3,0 years. Among them 85,3% were hypertensive, 47,1% diabetic, 47,1% had cardiovascular disease, 30,6% pulmonary chronic disease and 23,5% cancer. The most frequent symptoms were fever (67,6%), shortness of breath (61,8%) and cough (52,9%). At admission, 55,9% of patients needed oxygen supply, one required mechanic ventilation and was admitted to intensive care unit. Regarding laboratory data, the most common features were lymphopenia in 58,9% (median- 795/uL), elevated LDH in 64,7% (median- 255 U/L), raised C-reactive protein in 97,1% (median-6,3 mg/dlL, raised D-dimer in 95,8% (median 1,7 ng/mL), and all patients presented high ferritin (median 1658 ng/mL) and elevated Troponin T (median 130ng/mL). The majority presented with radiologic changes, particularly bilateral infiltrates in 29,4%. Concerning clinical outcomes, the median hospitalization time was 11 days and 13 patients (38,2%) developed bacterial superinfection. Mortality rate was 32,4%. When matched to 34 non-HD patients there was no statistical significant differences in sex, age and comorbidities. The HD group had a tendency to more ventilator support need (p=0,051), higher ferritin and troponin levels (p=<0,001 for both), whereas the non-HD group presented with greater levels of transaminases (p= 0,017). There was o significant difference in hospitalization time (median of 11 vs 7 days, p=0,222) neither in mortality (median of 32,4 vs 35,3%, p=0,798). When the logistic regression was performed, only bacterial superinfection was a predictor for mortality on hemodialysis patients (p=0,004). CONCLUSION: Our study compared outcomes for COVID-19 patients on chronic HD to non-dialysis patients and showed no difference in hospitalization time nor in death rate. In spite of these results, the mortality in patients on chronic HD is still not negligible, with up to 32% of in-hospital mortality. Bacterial superinfection is a predictive risk factor for mortality. Hence the importance of interventions to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 in these patients, by preventing its spread, particularly in hemodialysis centers.","output":"MO824 PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY OF COVID-19 IN CHRONIC HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following boom-and-bust economic cycles provoked by Brazilian governmental attempts to integrate Indigenous peoples into national society, it is approximately since the beginning of the 2000s that Brazilian Indigenous peoples came to be viewed officially as poor and victims of hunger.

Nevertheless, accuracy in HR readings is unreliable specifically during physical activity. Among several identified sources that affect PPG recording, contact pressure (CP) between the PPG sensor and skin greatly influences the signals. Methods: In this study, the accuracy of HR measurements of a PPG sensor at different CP was investigated when compared with a commercial ECG-based chest strap used as a test control, with the aim of determining the optimal CP to produce a reliable signal during physical activity. Seventeen subjects were enrolled for the study to perform a physical activity at three different rates repeated at three different contact pressures of the PPG-based wristband. Results: The results show that the CP of 54 mmHg provides the most accurate outcome with a Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.81 to 0.95 and a mean average percentage error ranging from 3.8% to 2.4%, based on the physical activity rate. Conclusion: Authors found that changes in the CP have greater effects on PPG-HR signal quality than those deriving from the intensity of the physical activity and specifically, the individual best CP for each subject provided reliable HR measurements even for a high intensity of physical exercise with a BlandCAltman plot within 11 bpm. Although future studies on a larger cohort of subjects are still needed, this study could contribute a profitable indication to enhance accuracy of PPG-based wearable devices.","output":"A Study on the Effect of Contact Pressure during Physical Activity on Photoplethysmographic Heart Rate Measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the surface of hands in humans is known to harbor high levels of antimicrobial activity, reports investigating the relationship between antimicrobial activity and morbidity in infectious diseases are lacking. Additionally, the precise components involved in this activity are not known. Therefore, in this study, a method was developed to quantitatively measure the antimicrobial activity of the components found on the surface of hands, which was then compared with the medical history of the participants for infectious diseases. As a result, the antimicrobial activity of the surface of the hands was found to be positively associated with the history of infection in individuals. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the components on the surface of hands indicated that organic acids and antimicrobial peptides are highly correlated with antimicrobial activity. The high amounts of lactic acid found on the surface of hands suggested it is an important factor in the hand surface infection barrier. Here we showed that the application of lactic acid within the range of the amounts present on the hand surface was found to significantly improve the antimicrobial activity of the hands. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this new method can be used to quantify antimicrobial activity, which opens new avenues for the development of hand hygiene practices by enhancing the antimicrobial activity on the surface of hands using natural ingredients against pathogens.","output":"Detailed Analysis of Surface Infection Barrier on Hands: Relationship with Morbidity to Infection Diseases and Identification of Antimicrobial Components"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we have considered a mathematical model that deals with the effectiveness of the measures that may be helpful for reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the society.

Among all the sources of noise pollution, the noise generated by road vehicle traffic significantly affects the quality of urban environments. Concerning the recent imposition of COVID-19 societal lockdown, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the changes in noise pollution levels before, during, and after lockdown phase in different residential, commercial, industrial, and silence zones of the city of Kanpur, India. Utilizing data collected from portable environmental sensors, the average noise levels before lockdown and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown, except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Results further indicated that the impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%), industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period, it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase. Even the risk of sleep disturbance in the residential zone was found to reduce from 37.96% during pre-lockdown to 14.72% during lockdown phase.

We prospectively assessed outcomes in patients managed in a hepatology clinic (HC) alone versus those managed in combination with a multidisciplinary weight management program (MWMP). We describe each group's readiness to change at the time of NAFLD diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD were given a modified Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) at enrollment (T1) to assess readiness to change. They were then followed at 3-9 months (T2) and at 10-15 months (T3). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in BMI, BMI z-score, and transaminases over time and between the two groups. There were no significant treatment group main effects or treatment x time interactions for our primary endpoints for HC alone (n=75) or with MWMP (n=18). There was a significant main effect for time for BMI z-score, with BMI z-scores declining on average by 0.0568 (p=.004) from visit to visit. Low SOCRATES subscales scores in HC alone (n=33) or with MWMP (n=4) suggested a patient population with low recognition of disease and likelihood of taking steps for change. Patients with obesity and NAFLD had low scores on all three SOCRATES sub-scales.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.","output":"Predicting engagement in behaviors to reduce the spread of COVID-19: the roles of the health belief model and political party affiliation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe early onset (less than 34 weeks gestation) intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) affects 0.1% of pregnant women in Australia and is associated with a 3-fold increased risk of stillbirth, fetal hypoxia and compromise, spontaneous preterm birth, as well as increased frequencies of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. ICP is often familial and overlaps with other cholestatic disorders. Treatment options for ICP are not well established, although there are limited data to support the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to relieve pruritus, the main symptom. Rifampicin, a widely used antibiotic including in pregnant women, is effective in reducing pruritus in non-pregnancy cholestasis and has been used as a supplement to UDCA in severe ICP. Many women with ICP are electively delivered preterm, although there are no randomised data to support this approach. METHODS: We have initiated an international multicentre randomised clinical trial to compare the clinical efficacy of rifampicin tablets (300 mg bd) with that of UDCA tablets (up to 2000 mg daily) in reducing pruritus in women with ICP, using visual pruritus scores as a measuring tool. DISCUSSION: Our study will be the first to examine the outcomes of treatment specifically in the severe early onset form of ICP, comparing standard UDCA therapy with rifampicin, and so be able to provide for the first-time high-quality evidence for use of rifampicin in severe ICP. It will also allow an assessment of feasibility of a future trial to test whether elective early delivery in severe ICP is beneficial.

Several e-learning modules have been developed by Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC). With distance learners and technological challenges such as poor internet bandwidth to be considered, UMC opted for the microlearning approach based on small learning units connected to specific learning objectives. The aim of this study was to evaluate how this e-learning course was received. METHODS: The course was evaluated through usage data and the results of two user surveys, one for modules 1-4, signal detection and causality assessment, and the other for module 5, statistical reasoning and algorithms in pharmacovigilance. The evaluation model used was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A questionnaire was developed, divided into demographic profile, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, educational compatibility and behavioural intention. The two surveys were disseminated to 2067 learners for modules 1-4 and 1685 learners for module 5. RESULTS: Learners from 137 countries participated, predominantly from industry (36.6%), national pharmacovigilance centres (22.6%) and academia (16.3%). The overall satisfaction level was very high for all modules, with over 90% of the learners rating it as either 'excellent' or 'good'. The majority were satisfied with the learning platform, the course content and the lesson duration. Most learners thought they would be able to apply the knowledge in practice. Almost 100% of the learners would recommend the modules to others and would also study future modules. Suggested improvements were an interactive forum, more practical examples in the lessons and practical exercises.

The tracking of behaviors and emotions is becoming more pervasive with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), where small and always connected sensors can continuously capture information about human gestures, movements and postures. The captured information about readable behaviors conveys significant information that can be represented as time series. Few studies in emotion recognition and affective computing have explored the connection between the time series sensors data and the emotional behavior they conveys. In this paper, an innovative approach is proposed to study the emotions and behaviors connected to the time series data. A convolutional network augmented with attention-based bidirectional LSTM is introduced to represent the correlations between behaviors and emotions. The advantage of this model is that it can well recognized emotions by exploiting the data captured by sensors.

The study involved 7 months (August 2020CFebruary 2021). Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment options with their outcome were recorded and analyzed. Out of 268 patients with parosmia, there were 197 (73.5%) females. The majority were from age group  30 years (n = 188, 70.1%), housewives (n = 150, 56%), non-smokers (n = 222, 82.8%), and associated with dysgeusia (n = 207, 77.2%) but not associated with nasal symptoms (n = 266, 99.3%). All patients have complained of anosmia (89.9%) or hyposmia (10.1%). Troposmia was reported in the majority of participants. The majority of the patients were suffering from severe parosmia (65.7%). Around 3 quarters of the cases were presented in  4 months. Altered quality of life (AQL) was presented in 91.8% of subjects, and there was a significant association with the presence of dysgeusia and type and severity of parosmia. The smoking habit didn't show a significant association with AQL, the severity of parosmia, and the recovery rate. Most of the odor group was the most triggering stimuli eliciting parosmia, while, the sewage was the response odor in above 50% of the cases.

We reviewed the existing literature from 2007 to April 2013 and expert opinions about clinician engagement and education for critical care during a pandemic or disaster and offer suggestions for integrating ICU clinicians into planning and response. The suggestions in this article are important for all of those involved in a pandemic or large-scale disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed and suggestions formulated according to the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Consensus Statement development methodology. We assessed articles, documents, reports, and gray literature reported since 2007. Following expert-informed sorting and review of the literature, key priority areas and questions were developed. No studies of sufficient quality were identified upon which to make evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS: Twenty-three suggestions were formulated based on literature-informed consensus opinion. These suggestions are grouped according to the following thematic elements: (1) situational awareness, (2) clinician roles and responsibilities, (3) education, and (4) community engagement. Together, these four elements are considered to form the basis for effective ICU clinician engagement for mass critical care. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal engagement of the ICU clinical team in caring for large numbers of critically ill patients due to a pandemic or disaster will require a departure from the routine independent systems operating in hospitals. An effective response will require robust information systems; coordination among clinicians, hospitals, and governmental organizations; pre-event engagement of relevant stakeholders; and standardized core competencies for the education and training of critical care clinicians.","output":"Engagement and Education: Care of the Critically Ill and Injured During Pandemics and Disasters: CHEST Consensus Statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shock is common in critically ill patients with COVID-19, developing in up to 67% of patients in intensive care (5% to 10% overall) and is associated with high mortality.

This could adversely impact epidemics of public health importance, such as HIV, and access to testing, which is a cornerstone of prevention efforts. METHODS: In this observational study, we collected HIV testing and positivity rate clinical data from four geographically diverse U.S. healthcare systems in New Orleans, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Providence, Rhode Island; and, Seattle, Washington. Data from 2019 to 2020 were examined to assess changes in HIV testing in community-based, emergency department, and outpatient settings. Poisson regression was used to explore trends in HIV testing through phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In outpatient settings, there was a 68-97% reduction in the number of HIV tests per week during each state's stay-at-home order period, compared to during the pre-stay-at-home order period in early 2020. HIV testing remained reduced 11-54% after states transitioned to advisory phases. The HIV positivity rate increased slightly at outpatient settings, except in New Orleans where it fell. INTERPRETATION: We found a concerning trend of substantially decreased HIV testing across four geographically diverse sites. These findings suggest that new HIV infections within the U.S. may be undiagnosed and not yet linked to clinical care and services, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, augmented efforts to identify patients and link them to HIV services will be needed as healthcare settings return to full operation.

The aims of this study were to evaluate whether the plasma concentration of the above-mentioned biomarkers was different 1) in survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19-related ARDS and 2) in COVID-19-related and classical ARDS. METHODS: This prospective study was performed in two COVID-19-dedicated Intensive Care Units (ICU) and one non-COVID-19 ICU at Ferrara University Hospital. A cohort of 31 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS and a cohort of 11 patients with classical ARDS were enrolled. Ang-2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE were determined with a bead-based multiplex immunoassay at three time points: inclusion in the study (T1), after 7  2 days (T2) and 14  2 days (T3). The primary outcome was to evaluate the plasma trend of the biomarker levels in survivors and non-survivors. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the differences in respiratory mechanics variables and gas exchanges between survivors and non-survivors. Furthermore, we compared the plasma levels of the biomarkers at T1 in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS and classical ARDS. RESULTS: In COVID-19-related ARDS, the plasma levels of Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were statistically higher in non-survivors than survivors, (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively), whereas those of P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE did not differ. Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were predictors of mortality (AUROC 0.650 and 0.717, respectively). At T1, RAGE and P-selectin levels were higher in classical ARDS than in COVID-19-related ARDS.

Diagnostic instruments are rapidly evolving. Symptoms range from those of a common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to sepsis arising from the flood of inflammatory bacterial and viral pathogens in the blood. Mortality generally arises from cytokine storms of uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, with secondary bacterial infection. To address the indisputably urgent need for therapeutics for COVID-19, a specialized interdisciplinary medical panel convened in Shanghai in March 2020 to consider all relevant clinical and experimental evidence on the possible utility of intravenous (IV) ascorbate in the treatment of COVID-19-related ARDS. Methods: The panel convened multidisciplinary medical experts and reviewed all relevant in vitro, in vivo, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials on IV ascorbate and issued a consensus report on 23 March 2020 noting that substantial differences in serum concentrations of ascorbate are achieved through IV administration in contrast with the oral route. Findings: The Shanghai panel, and a parallel medical group in Guangzhou, are advising the use of high-dose IV ascorbate for the treatment of ARDS, along with other supportive therapies, including Vitamin D and zinc. We report preliminary progress in using this treatment for 50 consecutive cases treated in Shanghai hospitals, consistent with earlier reports from a meta-analysis of the use of IV ascorbate to treat sepsis. We provide an instructive clinical anecdote regarding a single family where one elderly member with cardiac and other major comorbidities developed and survived ARDS-related sepsis following daily treatments that included 15 g of IV ascorbate.

As a result of these findings, an increase in inflammation and preatherogenic factors is observed, and these changes may lead to endothelial dysfunction. AIM Our study aims to reveal possible cardiac risks (systolic-diastolic functions and endothelial dysfunctions) in patients who have applied to the emergency department with hypoglycemia. METHODS This cross-sectional, case-control study included 46 hypoglycemia patients who admitted to the emergency with symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia and diagnosed with hypoglycemia and 30 healthy volunteers. All patients were evaluated with baseline echocardiography, tissue-Doppler imaging (carotid and brachial artery). Also, the fasting blood tests of the patients referred to the internal medicine department were examined. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Vitamin B12, TSH, and fasting blood glucose levels were similar in the groups' blood tests (all P values > .05). We observed a statistically significant decrease in diastolic dysfunction parameters: E/A and E/e' ratios (respectively, P = .020 and 0.026). It was shown that insulin resistance was influential in forming these considerable differences. The patient group observed that the carotid intima-media thickness was more remarkable (P = .001), and the brachial flow-mediated dilatation value was smaller (P = .003), giving an idea about endothelial functions. CONCLUSION As a message, we can say that hypoglycemia may affect diastolic functions in addition to endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, even young individuals without any chronic diseases may need follow-up in terms of possible risks.","output":"Hypoglycemia in the emergency, is there any effect on endothelial and diastolic functions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brucellosis is an important zoonosis occurring globally. In addition to the risk for disease in humans, the disease causes production losses, since the disease in livestock is characterized by abortion and other reproductive failures. The disease is a public health concern in China, but no information is available on knowledge, perception and awareness of potential risk groups such as farmers, butchers and animal health workers; yet successful control requires compliance of those affected groups to be effective. Following the principles of the Ecohealth approach, emphasis was given to participation of all relevant stakeholders, use of qualitative and quantitative tools, and cross-sectorial collaboration. Data collection included on-farm questionnaires (N = 192) and collection of bulk milk samples of goat (N = 40), cattle (N = 45) and buffalo (N = 41) from farms, as well as serum samples (N = 228) from humans. Milk samples were tested with an ELISA for presence of antibodies, while a serum agglutination test was used for human samples. Qualitative work included 17 focus group discussion (FGD) with villagers and 47 in-depth interviews (IDI) with village animal health workers, doctors, and butchers, focused on knowledge, perception and awareness on zoonoses including brucellosis. Results from questionnaires indicate that abortions are a common problem; cattle with abortion history are kept for further insemination and the milk still consumed or sold. Antibodies against Brucella were detected in cows (5/45) and goats (1/40) milk samples, and in human samples (5/126) in Yiliang, while in Mangshi, all buffalo (N = 41) and humans (N = 102) were negative. FGD and IDI results showed an alarmingly low knowledge and awareness on zoonoses; particularly, low awareness about brucellosis was noted, even among the professional groups. Collaboration between village animal health workers and doctors was uncommon. No confirmed brucellosis cases were found in retrospective investigation of hospital and veterinary stations. This study demonstrates the presence of brucellosis in livestock and humans in Yunnan, indicating a non-negligible risk for humans. It is also made apparent that there is a need for increased awareness among both farmers and professionals in order to reduce the risk of zoonotic transmissions.","output":"Participatory and Transdisciplinary Studies of Brucella Infection in Humans and Animals in Yunnan Province, ChinaLessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research project has the goal to verify whether the application of neuromarketing techniques, such as implicit association test (IAT) techniques and emotional facial expressions analyses may contribute to the assessment of user experience (UX) during and after website navigation. These techniques have been widely and positively applied in assessing customer experience (CX); however, little is known about their simultaneous application in the field of UX. As a specific context, the experience raised by different websites from two well-known automotive brands was compared. About 160 Italian university students were enrolled in an online experimental study. Participants performed a Brand Association Reaction Time Test (BARTT) version of the IAT where the two brands were compared according to different semantic dimensions already used in the automotive field. After completing the BARTT test, the participants navigated the target website: 80 participants navigated the first brand website, while the other half navigated the second brand website (between-subject design). During the first 3 min of website navigation, emotional facial expressions were recorded. The participants were asked to freely navigate the website home page, look for a car model and its characteristics and price, use the customising tool, and in the end, look for assistance. After the website navigation, all the participants performed, a second time, the BARTT version of the IAT, where the two brands were compared again, this time to assess whether the website navigation may impact the Implicit Associations previously detected. A traditional evaluation of the two websites was carried on by means of the classic heuristic evaluation. Findings from this study show, first of all, the significant results provided by neuromarketing techniques in the field of UX, as IAT can provide a positive application for assessing UX played by brand websites, thanks to the comparison of eventual changes in time reaction between the test performed before and after website navigation exposure. Secondly, results from emotional facial expression analyses during the navigation of both brand websites showed significant differences between the two brands, allowing the researchers to predict the emotional impact raised by each website. Finally, the positive correlation with heuristic evaluation shows that neuromarketing can be successfully applied in UX.","output":"Applying Implicit Association Test Techniques and Facial Expression Analyses in the Comparative Evaluation of Website User Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Pervasive refusal syndrome (PRS) is a rare psychiatric disease that affects children.

Despite this, PRS has not yet been classified in DSM-5 and ICD-11 and the lack of evidence-based treatment makes this syndrome a real challenge for clinicians. The aim of this paper is to present our experience through the description of a case report and its treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The case reported is a girl aged 11 years that fits the clinical picture described in the literature of PRS. In previous reports, behavioural treatment was not used or appreciated; our case adds new knowledge regarding the PRS diagnosis and the successful behavioural treatment during hospitalization, which we describe in all its phases.

Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: While the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our data showed differences between the antibody responses raised after the first and second BNT162b2 vaccination, in particular lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies in the elderly group. This suggests that this population needs to be closely monitored and may require earlier revaccination or/and an increased vaccine dose to ensure stronger long lasting immunity and protection against infection.","output":"Age-dependent immune response to the Biontech/Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication of COVID-19 encompassing a wide range of presentations.

Although the successful use of this technique is well reported in general surgery and urology, there is a lack of studies on SILS in gynaecology. AIMS To evaluate the feasibility, safety, cosmesis and outcome of SILS in gynaecology. METHODS A prospective case series analysis of 105 women scheduled to undergo surgery by SILS from August 2010 to November 2011. Intra-operative data such as operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, additional ports and hospital stay were collected. Post-operative pain and cosmetic outcomes (scar size) were also recorded. RESULTS Out of 105 women, SILS was performed for 84 (60 excisions of endometriosis, 13 divisions of adhesions, five hysterectomies, two mesh sacrohysteropexies and four ovarian cystectomies). SILS was not undertaken for 21 women because of a number of factors, including the lack of required equipment (eg bariatric scope, SILS port, roticulating instruments and diathermy leads). Four women required insertion of additional ports because of surgical difficulties. One intra-operative (uterine perforation) and seven post-operative complications (six wound infections and one vault haematoma) occurred. Mean operation times were as follows: mesh sacrohysteropexy - 60 min, excision of endometriosis - 55 min, hysterectomy - 150 min, laparoscopic division of adhesions - 62 min and ovarian cystectomy - 40 min.

We also compare these two models to other PAH models commonly used in research. In the last few years, the focus of animal PAH models has moved towards studying the mechanism of angioproliferation of plexiform lesions, in which the role of increased pulmonary blood flow is considered as an important trigger in the development of severe pulmonary vascular remodeling. One of the most promising rodent models of increased pulmonary flow is the unilateral left pneumonectomy combined with a \\"second hit\\" of MCT or Sugen. The removal of the left lung leads to increased and turbulent pulmonary blood flow and vascular remodeling. Currently, there is no detailed procedure of the pneumonectomy surgery in rats. This article details a step-by-step protocol of the pneumonectomy surgical procedure and post-operative care in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, the animal is anesthetized and the chest is opened. Once the left pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchus are visualized, they are ligated and the left lung is removed. The chest then closed and the animal recovered. Blood is forced to circulate only on the right lung. This increased vascular pressure leads to a progressive remodeling and occlusion of small pulmonary arteries. The second hit of MCT or Sugen is used one week post-surgery to induce endothelial dysfunction. The combination of increased blood flow in the lung and endothelial dysfunction produces severe PAH. The primary limitation of this procedure is that it requires general surgical skills.","output":"The Left Pneumonectomy Combined with Monocrotaline or Sugen as a Model of Pulmonary Hypertension in Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The illness ME/CFS has been repeatedly tied to infectious agents such as Epstein Barr Virus. Expanding research on the human microbiome now allows ME/CFS-associated pathogens to be studied as interacting members of human microbiome communities. Humans harbor these vast ecosystems of bacteria, viruses and fungi in nearly all tissue and blood. Most well-studied inflammatory conditions are tied to dysbiosis or imbalance of the human microbiome. While gut microbiome dysbiosis has been identified in ME/CFS, microbes and viruses outside the gut can also contribute to the illness. Pathobionts, and their associated proteins/metabolites, often control human metabolism and gene expression in a manner that pushes the body toward a state of illness. Intracellular pathogens, including many associated with ME/CFS, drive microbiome dysbiosis by directly interfering with human transcription, translation, and DNA repair processes. Molecular mimicry between host and pathogen proteins/metabolites further complicates this interference. Other human pathogens disable mitochondria or dysregulate host nervous system signaling. Antibodies and/or clonal T cells identified in patients with ME/CFS are likely activated in response to these persistent microbiome pathogens. Different human pathogens have evolved similar survival mechanisms to disable the host immune response and host metabolic pathways. The metabolic dysfunction driven by these organisms can result in similar clusters of inflammatory symptoms. ME/CFS may be driven by this pathogen-induced dysfunction, with the nature of dysbiosis and symptom presentation varying based on a patient's unique infectious and environmental history. Under such conditions, patients would benefit from treatments that support the human immune system in an effort to reverse the infectious disease process.","output":"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the Era of the Human Microbiome: Persistent Pathogens Drive Chronic Symptoms by Interfering With Host Metabolism, Gene Expression, and Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health.

These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.

Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis.

This model simulates the infection trends for a hypothetical situation in which HK adopts centralized quarantine measures, and compares them to actual infection numbers. Results suggest that home quarantine would have been less effective than centralized quarantine initially. However, the infection rate under home quarantine later converges with the counterfactual estimate under centralized quarantine (0.136% vs. 0.174%), suggesting similar efficacy in the later phase of implementation. Considering its minimal reliance on public resources, home quarantine with heightened enforcement may therefore be preferable to centralized quarantine in countries with limited public health resources.

This study aimed at identifying potential key genes (KGs), highlighting their functions, signaling pathways, and candidate drugs for CC diagnosis and targeting therapies. Four publicly available microarray datasets of CC were analyzed for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the LIMMA approach through GEO2R online tool. We identified 116 common DEGs (cDEGs) that were utilized to identify seven KGs (AURKA, BRCA1, CCNB1, CDK1, MCM2, NCAPG2, and TOP2A) by the proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of KGs revealed some important functions and signaling pathways that were significantly associated with CC infections. The interaction network analysis identified four TFs proteins and two miRNAs as the key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of KGs. Considering seven KGs-based proteins, four key TFs proteins, and already published top-ranked seven KGs-based proteins (where five KGs were common with our proposed seven KGs) as drug target receptors, we performed their docking analysis with the 80 meta-drug agents that were already published by different reputed journals as CC drugs.

However, when FD devices are explicitly represented in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, flow around the stent wires must be resolved, leading to high computational cost. Classic porous medium (PM) methods can reduce computational expense but cannot capture the inhomogeneous FD wire distribution once implanted on a cerebral artery and thus cannot accurately model the post-stenting aneurysmal flow. We report a novel approach that models the FD flow modification as a thin inhomogeneous porous medium (iPM). It improves over the classic PM approaches in two ways. First, the FD is more appropriately treated as a thin screen, which is more accurate than the classic 3D-PM-based Darcy-Forchheimer relation. Second, pressure drop is calculated cell-by-cell using the local FD geometric parameters across an inhomogeneous PM. We applied the iPM technique to simulating the post-stenting hemodynamics of three patient-specific aneurysms. To test its accuracy and speed, we compared the results from the iPM technique against CFD simulations with explicit FD devices. The iPM CFD ran 500% faster than the explicit CFD while achieving 94%-99% accuracy; thus, iPM is a promising clinical bedside modeling tool to assist endovascular interventions with FD and stents.","output":"Cerebral aneurysm flow diverter modeled as a thin inhomogeneous porous medium in hemodynamic simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Textile meshes frequently are implanted in the abdominal wall to reinforce a hernia repair.

We aimed to understand the patient experience around telehealth for delivery of postpartum care using a qualitative approach. Study Design: We performed individual, semi-structured patient interviews (n=25) within two weeks of a scheduled telehealth postpartum visit (PPV) at our institution. Interviews were performed by phone from 10/1/2020-1/1/2021, more than 6 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcriptions were analyzed using grounded theory and coded with a systematic approach. Results: Overall, participants reported mixed preferences for the modality of the postpartum visit (in-person vs. telehealth). Those in favor of telehealth focused on its convenience and flexibility. When performed via video and audio rather than audio alone, participants felt telehealth well-simulated in-person engagement. Participants also reported similar experiences by modality regarding contraceptive planning. On the other hand, several participants raised concerns about the limitations of telehealth for physical examination, such as providing patient reassurance regarding healing after delivery. Reported facilitators to telehealth were lack of need for childcare or transportation to an in-person encounter, minimized disruption to maternal-newborn routine, and prioritizing safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported barriers also included the need for childcare during the telehealth encounter, as well as difficulty finding a private space for the visit, scheduling and logistic challenges, privacy concerns, and technological difficulties. Conclusion: Telehealth is becoming an increasingly utilized modality of PPVs in the United States. In this qualitative analysis, we characterize patients experiences with telehealth postpartum care, and identify areas of patient concern.

In the aftermath of the SARS crisis, there was a need for a clearer understanding of Ontario's capacity to manage suspected or confirmed cases of airborne infectious diseases. In so doing, the Walker Commission thought that more attention should be paid to the potential use of new technologies such as in-room air cleaning units. It recommended that the Medical Advisory Secretariat of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care evaluate the appropriate use and effectiveness of such new technologies. Accordingly, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee asked the Medical Advisory Secretariat to review the literature on the effectiveness and utility of in-room air cleaners that use high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) air cleaning technology. Additionally, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee prioritized a request from the ministry's Emergency Management Unit to investigate the possible role of the Plasmacluster ion air purifier manufactured by Sharp Electronics Corporation, in the pandemic influenza preparation plan. CLINICAL NEED Airborne transmission of infectious diseases depends in part on the concentration of breathable infectious pathogens (germs) in room air. Infection control is achieved by a combination of administrative, engineering, and personal protection methods. Engineering methods that are usually carried out by the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system function to prevent the spread of airborne infectious pathogens by diluting (dilution ventilation) and removing (exhaust ventilation) contaminated air from a room, controlling the direction of airflow and the air flow patterns in a building. However, general wear and tear over time may compromise the HVAC system's effectiveness to maintain adequate indoor air quality. Likewise, economic issues may curtail the completion of necessary renovations to increase its effectiveness. Therefore, when exposure to airborne infectious pathogens is a risk, the use of an in-room air cleaner to reduce the concentration of airborne pathogens and prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases has been proposed as an alternative to renovating a HVAC system. Airborne transmission is the spread of infectious pathogens over large distances through the air. Infectious pathogens, which may include fungi, bacteria, and viruses, vary in size and can be dispersed into the air in drops of moisture after coughing or sneezing. Small drops of moisture carrying infectious pathogens are called droplet nuclei. Droplet nuclei are about 1 to 5m in diameter. This small size in part allows them to remain suspended in the air for several hours and be carried by air currents over considerable distances. Large drops of moisture carrying infectious pathogens are called droplets. Droplets being larger than droplet nuclei, travel shorter distances (about 1 metre) before rapidly falling out of the air to the ground. Because droplet nuclei remain airborne for longer periods than do droplets, they are more amenable to engineering infection control methods than are droplets. Droplet nuclei are responsible for the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, chicken pox (varicella), measles (rubeola), and dessiminated herpes zoster, whereas close contact is required for the direct transmission of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, such as influenza (the flu) and SARS. THE TECHNOLOGY In-room air cleaners are supplied as portable or fixed devices. Fixed devices can be attached to either a wall or ceiling and are preferred over portable units because they have a greater degree of reliability (if installed properly) for achieving adequate room air mixing and airflow patterns, which are important for optimal effectiveness. Through a method of air recirculation, an in-room air cleaner can be used to increase room ventilation rates and if used to exhaust air out of the room it can create a negative-pressure room for airborne infection isolation (AII) when the building's HVAC system cannot do so. A negative-pressure room is one where clean air flows into the room but contaminated air does not flow out of it. Contaminated room air is pulled into the in-room air cleaner and cleaned by passing through a series of filters, which remove the airborne infectious pathogens. The cleaned air is either recirculated into the room or exhausted outside the building. By filtering contaminated room air and then recirculating the cleaned air into the room, an in-room air cleaner can improve the room's ventilation. By exhausting the filtered air to the outside the unit can create a negative-pressure room. There are many types of in-room air cleaners. They vary widely in the airflow rates through the unit, the type of air cleaning technology used, and the technical design. Crucial to maximizing the efficiency of any in-room air cleaner is its strategic placement and set-up within a room, which should be done in consultation with ventilation engineers, infection control experts, and/or industrial hygienists. A poorly positioned air cleaner may disrupt airflow patterns within the room and through the air cleaner, thereby compromising its air cleaning efficiency. The effectiveness of an in-room air cleaner to remove airborne pathogens from room air depends on several factors, including the airflow rate through the unit's filter and the airflow patterns in the room. Tested under a variety of conditions, in-room air cleaners, including portable or ceiling mounted units with either a HEPA or a non-HEPA filter, portable units with UVGI lights only, or ceiling mounted units with combined HEPA filtration and UVGI lights, have been estimated to be between 30% and 90%, 99% and 12% and 80% effective, respectively. However, and although their effectiveness is variable, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged in-room air cleaners as alternative technology for increasing room ventilation when this cannot be achieved by the building's HVAC system with preference given to fixed recirculating systems over portable ones. Importantly, the use of an in-room air cleaner does not preclude either the need for health care workers and visitors to use personal protective equipment (N95 mask or equivalent) when entering AII rooms or health care facilities from meeting current regulatory requirements for airflow rates (ventilation rates) in buildings and airflow differentials for effective negative-pressure rooms. The Plasmacluster ion technology, developed in 2000, is an air purification technology. Its manufacturer, Sharp Electronics Corporation, says that it can disable airborne microorganisms through the generation of both positive and negative ions. (1) The functional unit is the hydroxyl, which is a molecule comprised of one oxygen molecule and one hydrogen atom. Plasmacluster ion air purifier uses a multilayer filter system composed of a prefilter, a carbon filter, an antibacterial filter, and a HEPA filter, combined with an ion generator to purify the air. The ion generator uses an alternating plasma discharge to split water molecules into positively and negatively charged ions. When these ions are emitted into the air, they are surrounded by water molecules and form cluster ions which are attracted to airborne particles. The cluster ion surrounds the airborne particle, and the positive and negative ions react to form hydroxyls. These hydroxyls steal the airborne particle's hydrogen atom, which creates a hole in the particle's outer protein membrane, thereby rendering it inactive. Because influenza is primarily acquired by large droplets and direct and indirect contact with an infectious person, any in-room air cleaner will have little benefit in controlling and preventing its spread. Therefore, there is no role for the Plasmacluster ion air purifier or any other in-room air cleaner in the control of the spread of influenza. Accordingly, for purposes of this review, the Medical Advisory Secretariat presents no further analysis of the Plasmacluster. REVIEW STRATEGY The objective of the systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of in-room air cleaners with built in UVGI lights and HEPA filtration compared with those using HEPA filtration only. The Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, INAHATA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment), Biosis Previews, Bacteriology Abstracts, Web of Science, Dissertation Abstracts, and NIOSHTIC 2. A meta-analysis was conducted if adequate data was available from 2 or more studies and where statistical and clinical heterogeneity among studies was not an issue. Otherwise, a qualitative review was completed. The GRADE system was used to summarize the quality of the body of evidence comprised of 1 or more studies.

It has been hypothesized that molecular mimicry may play a role in triggering an autoimmune inflammatory reaction in some individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we investigate if linear peptides contained in proteins that are primarily expressed in the heart also occur in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Specifically, we compared the library of 136,704 8-mer peptides from 144 human proteins (including splicing variants) to 9926 8-mers from all the viral proteins in the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. No 8-mers were exactly identical between the reference human proteome and the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. However, there were 45 8-mers that differed by only one amino acid when compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, analysis of protein-coding mutations from 141,456 individuals showed that one of these 8-mers from the SARS-CoV-2 Replicase polyprotein 1a/1ab (KIALKGGK) is identical to an MYH6 peptide encoded by the c.5410 C > A (Q1804K) genetic variation, which has been observed at low prevalence in Africans/African Americans (0.08%), East Asians (0.3%), South Asians (0.06%), and Latino/Admixed Americans (0.003%). Furthermore, analysis of 4.85 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from over 200 countries shows that viral evolution has already resulted in 20 additional 8-mer peptides that are identical to human heart-enriched proteins encoded by reference sequences or genetic variants. Whether such mimicry contributes to cardiac inflammation during or after COVID-19 illness warrants further experimental evaluation. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring peptides identical to human cardiac proteins should be investigated as viral variants of cardiac interest.","output":"Genetic alteration of human MYH6 is mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein: mapping viral variants of cardiac interest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Since December 2019 there has been a rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across most of the world. This has determined the enormous burden on the global economy. The burden of the new coronavirus infection is determined not only by the costs directly related to the treatment of the acute phase of the disease, but also by the successful rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19, risk reduction and timely management of adverse outcomes for optimal patient recovery. Aim. The aim of the study was to analyze the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 and to estimate the possibility of their correction and prevention. Material and methods. We analyzed the PubMed database for 2020-2021 using the keywords left-pointing-double-angle COVID-19, pulmonary outcomes and treatment right-pointing-double-angle , as well as the online meetings of chief pulmonologists of the Volga Federal District (VFD) in April 2021, where we heard about the regional experience in prevention and correction of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Results and discussion. More and more publications are appearing on the so-called left-pointing-double-angle postdrome right-pointing-double-angle after COVID-19. Postdrome problems are becoming increasingly important as more and more treated patients are discharged from hospitals. To date, there are already over 103 million COVID-19 survivors. In patients with severe or critical manifestations of the disease, widespread and progressive endothelial thrombosis with diffuse microvascular thrombosis is increasingly evident as the final stage of the proinflammatory cytokine storm. Adequate anticoagulant therapy primarily using heparins with direct antiviral activity, preventing venous thromboembolism, being used for pulmonary thrombosis, is relevant in the prevention of adverse outcomes. Many authors note long-lasting residual changes on lung CT after the acute phase of COVID-19. At the same time, unlike post-inflammatory pneumosclerosis in the outcome of bacterial pneumonias, these changes can often regress within 6-12 months after a viral infection. Along with the effects of optimal anticoagulant therapy in the prevention of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, the available literature discusses the possibility of different regimens of glucocorticosteroid therapy. At the expert council of pulmonology specialists of the Volga Federal District the regional experience of using a domestic drug bovgialuronidase azoximer (Longidase) with official indications for treatment of fibrosis was covered in the therapeutic complex of patients with severe forms of COVID-19.

During high-multiplicity infection of cultured mammalian cells with Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV), NSs is rapidly degraded after reaching peak levels of expression at 12hpi. Through the use of inhibitors this was shown to be the result of proteasomal degradation. A recombinant virus (rBUN4KR), in which all four lysine residues in NSs were replaced by arginine residues, expresses an NSs protein (NSs4KR) that is resistant to degradation, confirming that degradation is lysine-dependent. However, despite repeated attempts, no direct ubiquitylation of NSs in infected cells could be demonstrated. This suggests that degradation of NSs, although lysine-dependent, may be achieved through an indirect mechanism. Infection of cultured mammalian cells or mice indicated no disadvantage for the virus in having a non-degradable NSs protein: in fact rBUN4KR had a slight growth advantage over wtBUNV in interferon-competent cells, presumably due to the increased and prolonged presence of NSs.

Due to the high food exports and low application of wastewater reclamation in less developed provinces, the effect of reclaimed water use in those provinces is not as obvious as that in developed provinces. This paper offers a new perspective for understanding the current VRWN and guidance for the optimization of the virtual water trade structure.","output":"What the reclaimed water use can change: From a perspective of inter-provincial virtual water network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Without universal access to point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 testing, many hospitals rely on clinical judgement alone for identifying cases of COVID-19 early. METHODS Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust introduced a 'traffic light' clinical judgement aid to the COVID-19 admissions unit in mid-March 2020. Ability to accurately predict COVID-19 was audited retrospectively across different stages of the epidemic. RESULTS One SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient (1/41, 2%) was misallocated to a 'green' (non-COVID-19) area during the first period of observation, and no patients (0/32, 0%) were mislabelled 'green' during the second period. 33 of 62 (53%) labelled 'red' (high risk) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive during the first period, while 5 of 22 (23%) 'red' patients were PCR positive in the second.

Comparative insolvency law literature traditionally compares Australia to jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. However, Germany has a track record of using insolvency law to manage social and economic crises. The German approach suggests solutions to critical issues not dealt with in the Australian safe harbour legislation, such as the failure to suspend other statutory duties to provide clear guidance to directors on the balancing of various interests, and the treatment of potential voidable transactions and new monies (i.e., new funding or credit). The responses in both jurisdictions suggest a change in priorities away from creditor protection, a key raison d'tre for these types of duties, during a crisis. Similar to the German approach of turning the obligation to file for formal insolvency proceedings off and on, the further safe harbour adopted in Australia as part of a new restructuring procedure for small businesses, which commenced on January 1, 2021, suggests that the use of safe harbours could become a permanent crisis\\\\management tool in Australia too, with potential consequences for the balance between debtor and creditor interests.","output":"Directors' duties to prevent insolvent trading in a crisis: Responses to COVID\\\\19 in Australia and lessons from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently putting a massive strain on the world's critical infrastructures.

The development of COVID-19 associated AKI is closely linked to the severity of the disease course. The main risk factor for kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy is the necessity for invasive ventilation, whereby the onset of renal failure is often closely associated with the timing of intubation. Additionally, the risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 have been shown to also be risk factors for renal failure. AKI in COVID-19 shows a high mortality and in some patients leads to chronic kidney disease; however, full recovery of kidney function in survivors who need dialysis is not uncommon. With respect to prevention and treatment of renal failure associated with COVID-19, the same recommendations as for AKI from other causes are valid (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, KDIGO bundles). Due to the large numbers of patients in the setting of overwhelmed resources, the availability of extracorporeal renal replacement procedures can become critical, especially since hypercoagulation is frequent in COVID?19.

However, they are active only against proliferating fungal cells and unable to completely eradicate fungal cells even after a 24 h drug exposure in standard time-kill assays. Surprisingly, we found that caspofungin, when dissolved in low ionic solutions, had rapid and potent antimicrobial activities against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida and bacteria cells even in non-growth conditions.

Furthermore, caspofungin dissolved in low ionic solutions drastically reduced mature biofilm cells of MDR Candida auris in only 5 min, as well as Candida-bacterial polymicrobial biofilms in a catheter-lock therapy model. Caspofungin displayed ion concentration-dependent conformational changes and intracellular accumulation with increased reactive oxygen species production, indicating a novel mechanism of action in low ionic conditions.

SARS-CoV-2 emergency use authorization (EUA) test is a cartridge-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. METHODS: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (C(T)). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. C(T) value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33  C(T) < 35.3 C(T) range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings.

Myths, rumors, and false information on COVID-19 and vaccines are flourishing, and the aftermath can be disastrous. A more concerning trend is that people are increasingly relying on social media to obtain healthcare information and tending to believe what they read on social media. Given the serious consequences of misinformation, this study aims to advance our understanding of a potential cure for the infodemic we face. Specifically, we focus on a countermeasure that Twitter currently employs, which is to nudge users toward credible information when users search topics for which erroneous information is rampant. Twitters policy is unique, in that the intervention is not about censorship but rather about redirecting users away from false information and toward facts. Our analysis utilizes 1,796 news articles that contain misinformation about health topics such as measles, vaccine, cancer, and COVID-19. Our analysis reveals that Twitters policy effectively reduces misinformation diffusion. After the policy introduction, a news article that contains misinformation is 17% less likely to start a diffusion process on Twitter. In addition, tweets that contain a link to misinformation articles are less likely to be retweeted, quoted, or replied to, which leads to a significant reduction in the aggregated number of tweets each misinformation article attracts. We further uncover that the observed reduction is driven by the decrease both in original tweet poststhose that first introduce misinformation news articles to the Twitter platformand in those resharing the misinformation, although the reduction is more significant in resharing posts. Lastly, we find that the effect is driven primarily by a decrease in human-like accounts that share links to unverified claims but not by a decrease in activities by bot-like accounts. Our findings indicate that a misinformation policy that relies on a nudge to a credible source rather than on censorship can substantially contain misinformation.","output":"A Nudge to Credible Information as a Countermeasure to Misinformation: Evidence from Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. Findings Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.

Samples from placenta, chorion, amnion, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, and 8 fetal sites were procured at 5 daily time points thereafter until term for analysis. RESULTS When controlled by acellular luciferase, donor HSCs were identified in the amnion, chorion, placenta, and amniotic fluid of fetuses receiving cells at all time points (p = 0.033 to <0.001), peaking first at the amnion and subsequently at the chorion and placenta. Cells could be detected in the fetal liver as early as day 1, progressively expanding to all the other fetal sites over time, in parallel to their increased presence in the chorion and placenta.

Such determination is particularly challenging because NPs are extremely difficult to detect and quantify once distributed in a biological system. Radiolabelling with positron or gamma emitters and subsequent imaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) are some of the few valid alternatives. However, NPs that degrade or radionuclides that detach or are released from the NPs can cause artefact. Here, submicron-sized poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) stabilised with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were dual radiolabelled using gamma emitters with different energy spectra incorporated into the core and coating. To label the core, 111In-doped iron oxide NPs were encapsulated inside PLGA-NPs during NP preparation, and the BSA coating was labelled by electrophilic substitution using 125I. After intravenous administration into rats, energy-discriminant SPECT resolved each radioisotope independently. Imaging revealed different fates for the core and coating, with a fraction of the two radionuclides co-localising in the liver and lungs for long periods of time after administration, suggesting that NPs are stable in these organs. Organ harvesting followed by gamma counting corroborated the SPECT results. The general methodology reported here represents an excellent alternative for visualising the degradation process of multi-labelled NPs in vivo and can be extended to a wide range of engineered NPs.","output":"Visualisation of dual radiolabelled poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticle degradation in vivo using energy-discriminant SPECT."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Online teaching has expanded over the past few decades, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The equipment is portable, relatively inexpensive, and simple to use. One disadvantage, however, is that nasal inspiratory peak flow is influenced by lower airway as well as upper airway function. Rhinomanometry is a more sensitive technique that is specific for nasal measurements. The equipment, however, requires an operator, is more expensive, and is not portable. Thus, it is applicable only for clinic visit measures in clinical trials. Measurements require patient cooperation and coordination, and not all can achieve repeatable results. Thus, this objective measure is best suited to laboratory challenge studies involving smaller numbers of selected volunteers. A nonphysiological measure of nasal patency is acoustic rhinometry. This sonic echo technique measures internal nasal luminal volume and the minimum cross-sectional area. The derivation of these measures from the reflected sound waves requires complex mathematical transformation and makes several theoretical assumptions. Despite this, however, such measures correlate well with the nasal physiological measures, and the nasal volume measures have been shown to relate well to results obtained by imaging techniques such as computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. Like rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry is not suitable for home monitoring and can be applied only to clinic visit measures or for laboratory nasal challenge monitoring. It has advantages in being easy to use, in requiring little patient cooperation, and in providing repeatable results. In addition to nasal obstruction, allergic rhinitis is recognized to be associated with impaired mucociliary clearance and altered nasal responsiveness. Measures exist for the monitoring of these aspects of nasal dysfunction. Although measures of mucociliary clearance are simple to perform, they have a poor record of reproducibility. Their incorporation into clinical trials is thus questionable, although positive outcomes from therapeutic intervention have been reported. Measures of nasal responsiveness are at present largely confined to research studies investigating disease mechanisms in allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. The techniques are insufficiently standardized to be applied to multicenter clinical trials but could be used in limited-center studies to gain insight into the regulatory effects of different therapeutic modalities.","output":"Objective monitoring of nasal patency and nasal physiology in rhinitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Menopause is the natural cessation of menstruation and may be accompanied by troublesome symptoms including hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms) and genitourinary symptoms. Randomized trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of interventions for these symptoms have reported a wide range of outcomes and used inconsistent measures. This variation precludes comparing and combining data from different trials. To overcome this limitation, we will develop a Core Outcome Set for Menopausal Symptoms. METHODS: We will systematically review the literature to identify the outcomes reported in the interventional trials for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms. This list will be entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey to be completed by clinicians, researchers, and consumers (women who have experienced menopause). Participants will score outcomes on a nine-point scale from not important to critically important. Representatives from each stakeholder group will then meet to discuss the results and finalize the Core Outcome Set. Ethics approval was not required as this was considered service evaluation and development. The study is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/917). RESULTS: An agreed upon set of minimum outcomes and outcome measures will facilitate combining and comparing findings from future trials of treatments for menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This Core Outcome Set will better enable women and clinicians to select effective treatments, improve the quality of trial reporting, reduce research wastage, and improve care for women with troublesome menopausal symptoms.

There are few accurate mortality estimates in SARI patients, particularly in adults  65 years old. The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital. Mortality increased to 12% (30/258, 30% increase) when electronic vital records and a 30-day post-hospitalization time frame were used. Being age  65 years (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6C9.9) and having an intensive care unit admission (OR = 7.4; 95% CI: 3.0C17.9) were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The use of electronic vital records increased SARI-associated mortality estimates by 30%.

It expects to increase productivity by optimizing the land and minimizing environmental pollution. The study aims to understand the perception level of society towards the environmental pollution of the integrated livestock-fish production system on raising catfish and laying duck (Clarias sp and Anas platyrhynchos). The study was conducted in Desa Balunijuk, Bangka. The questionnaire was used for the data collection technique through a face-to-face interview by following the health protocol of Covid-19. Two stages of data collection were applied: before and after treatment of Probio_Fm. Qualitative descriptive was employed to analyze the data. The respondents were the society who lived nearby the location of the study. A mixture of probiotics was employed on the feed and the catfish pond. The study found that the perception was significantly different between before and after treatment of Probio_Fm particularly on the negative environmental effects such as odor pollutants due to unmanaged animal waste. It occurred at the very beginning of the study during the wet season before the probiotic treatment. Interestingly, during the dry season, the probiotic treatment was regularly applied. The odor pollutant impact decreased even not having a bad odor at all. The waste both absorbed in the sand and was streamed through the drain pipeline. However, most of the respondents were not disturbed due to the odor pollutant surrounding the integrated livestock-fish production system. It articulated that the probiotic treatment worked effectively in unraveling the bacteria so that the pollutant level decreased drastically. The study recommended various solutions to the problems: the draining pipeline should be repaired, the animal feed should use probiotics to achieve optimal use of nutrition, consistent and effective feeding should be applied, and the cleanliness of the duck house should be properly maintained. The monitoring and evaluation of the environmental impact towards the integrated livestock-fish production system should involve relevant stakeholders such as a village government, the management, and society as a whole so that the healthy and environment-friendly integrated fisheries activity can be achieved.","output":"The perception level on the impact of integrated livestock-fish production systems towards the environmental pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the past years, and even more now with the major challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are faced with the inadequacies that undermine the healthcare system in Greece.

Thus, in order to improve the performance of the healthcare system in the best interest of patients and communities, the education of healthcare personnel should be a priority. By reviewing the existing literature in combination with our experience we attempt to delineate the weak points of the undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Greece. Additionally, based on medical curricula from other countries, we suggest reforms in order to achieve a uniform, clinically oriented, emphasis on training in public health issues in undergraduate medical education. Reforms are also suggested for postgraduate training with regard not only to specialization curricula, but also to the accredited institutions which provide specialty training. Finally, the necessity for Continuing Medical Education (CME) is underlined; medical education must have a continuum that begins with undergraduate training but does not end there; it is life-long learning.","output":"Medical education in Greece: Necessary reforms need to be re-considered."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s10888-021-09499-2.].","output":"Correction to: the Fall in Income Inequality during COVID-19 in Four European Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive or inappropriate inflammation and immunosuppression are components of the response to surgery, trauma, injury, and infection in some individuals and these can lead, progressively, to sepsis and septic shock. The hyperinflammation is characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators, while the immunosuppression is characterized by impairment of antigen presentation and of T helper cell type-1 responses. Long-chain n?3 FA from fish oil decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids. They act both directly (by replacing arachidonic acid as an eicosanoid substrate and by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism) and indirectly (by altering the expression of inflammatory genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Thus, long-chain n?3 FA are potentially useful anti-inflammatory agents and may be of benefit in patients at risk of developing sepsis. As such, an emerging application of n?3 FA is in surgical or critically ill patients where they may be added to parenteral or enteral formulas. Parenteral or enteral nutrition including n?3 FA appears to preserve immune function better than standard formulas and appears to partly prevent some aspects of the inflammatory response.

The availability of the COVID 19 vaccine has been widely anticipated, yet not all individuals will seek the vaccine. Once vaccines are available for children under the age of 16 years, this long-standing pediatric management issue may again emerge and impact public health.

METHODS: Between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, patients with COVID-19 infection and surgically treated PFF were included. Patients demographic characteristics, oxygen (O2) therapy, comorbidities, and AO type fracture were collected. Chi-square test or Fisher test and hazard ratio were used to assessing the correlation between mortality rate, patient characteristics, and COVID-19 status. Kaplan-Meyer curve was used to analyze 30C60C90-day mortality. Level of significance was set as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (mean age of 82.7  8.85 years) were included. Thirty-day mortality rate was 5%, which increased to 21% at 60 days and 90 days. Eleven patients died, eight due to AO type A-like and three due to AO type B-like fractures. No significant difference in mortality rate between patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity or no cardiopulmonary comorbidity was found (p = 0.67); a significant difference in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and patients without COPD was found (p = 0.0021). A significant difference between asymptomatic/mild symptomatic COVID-19 status and symptomatic COVID-19 status was found (p = 0.0415); a significant difference was found for O2 therapy with < 4 L/min and O2 therapy  4 L/min (p = 0.0049). CONCLUSION: Thirty-day mortality rate of COVID-19 infection and PFFs does not differ from mortality rate of non-COVID-19 PFFs.

This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. METHODS: All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. RESULTS: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age <40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees.

Methods We included patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized between July 2018 and June 2020 using Diagnostic Procedure Combination data, an administrative database in Japan, and counted the admission cases whose primary diagnosis was alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis. We defined the period from April 2020, when the Japanese government declared a state of emergency, as the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The rate ratio (RR) of admissions with alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis per 1,000 admissions was tested using interrupted time series analysis. In addition, excess admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis were calculated. Results Overall admissions were 3,026,389 cases, and a total of 10,242 admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis occurred from 257 hospitals. The rate of admissions per 1,000 admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak period (April 2020 to June 2020) had a 1.2 times increase compared with the pre-outbreak period (July 2018 to March 2020) for cases of alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis (RR: 1.22, 95%Confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.33).

METHODS: In 41 PV pregnancies, the pregnancy outcome, the use of PV-specific therapies (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid, low molecular weight heparin and/or interferon-alpha) and the postpartum PV course were investigated. RESULTS: A live birth rate of 51.2 % (21/41 pregnancies) was observed. 43.9 % of pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion and 4.9 % in stillbirth. A significantly increased live birth rate occurred in pregnancies with PV-specific therapies compared to standard antenatal care (69.0% vs. 8.3%; p<0.0019).

Methods: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, questionnaires were distributed in-person and online to 1011 migrant workers subjected to movement restrictions. Mental health symptoms were assessed using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As covariates, we also assessed participants' socio-demographics, quarantine status, COVID-19 health concerns, financial stability, and exposure to news and misinformation. Linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with each of the three DASS-21 subscales. Findings: Complete movement restrictions (e.g., prolonged in-dormitory quarantine) were associated with increased depression and stress symptoms, while being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with increased anxiety. Participants who harboured fears about their health or job, perceived their health to be poorer, or had higher exposure to COVID-19 rumours reported higher scores on all three subscales. At a group level, documented rates of severe or extremely severe depression (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-4.3%), anxiety (4.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-5.5%), and stress (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-2.2%) were similar to those observed in the general population for the host country.

The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of facial PIs. The secondary outcomes of interest were facial pain while wearing PPE and ease of use of the care bundle. METHODS: This study used a voluntary survey by questionnaire, supplemented by a qualitative analysis of interviews from a small purposive sample that took place in one large Irish hospital over a two-month period in 2020. The hospital was a city-based public university teaching hospital with 800 inpatient beds. The intervention was a care bundle consisting of skin protection, face mask selection, material use, skin inspection, cleansing and hydration developed in line with international best practice guidelines. All staff working in COVID-19 wards, intensive care units and the emergency department in the hospital were given a kitbag containing the elements of the care bundle plus an information pamphlet. Data were collected via a survey and interviews. RESULTS: A total of 114 staff provided feedback on the use of the care bundle. Before using the care bundle 29% (n=33) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI, whereas after using the care bundle only 8% (n=9) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI. The odds ratio (OR) of skin injury development was 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-10.49; p=0.0001), suggesting that after the care bundle was issued, those who responded to the survey were almost five times less likely to develop a skin injury. Interviews with 14 staff determined that the bundle was easy to use and safe. CONCLUSION: Among those who responded to the survey, the use of the bundle was associated with a reduction in the incidence of skin injury from 29% to 8%, and respondents found the bundle easy to use, safe and effective. As with evidence from the international literature, this study has identified that when skincare is prioritised, and a systematic preventative care bundle approach is adopted, there are clear benefits for the individuals involved.","output":"Facial pressure injuries and the COVID-19 pandemic: skin protection care to enhance staff safety in an acute hospital setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, testing is highly essential to be able to isolate, treat infected persons, and finally curb transmission of this infectious respiratory disease Group testing has been used previously for various infectious diseases and recently reported for large-scale population testing of COVID-19 However, possible sample dilution as a result of large pool sizes has been reported, limiting testing methods detection sensitivity Moreover, the need to sample all individuals prior to pooling overburden the limited resources such as test kits An alternative proposed strategy where test is performed on pooled samples from individuals representing different households is presented here This strategy intends to improve group testing method through the reduction in the number of samples collected and pooled during large-scale population testing Moreover, it introduces database system which enables continuous monitoring of the populations virus exposure for better decision making","output":"Household representative sample strategy for COVID-19 large-scale population screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heparanase (HPSE) is a multifunctional protein endowed with many non-enzymatic functions and a unique enzymatic activity as an endo--d-glucuronidase.

However, there still exists a non-standardized metric in which the distance between samples is greater than 1 after features are standardized. It is difficult to find the optimal search path if the data sample metrics are not standardized. To address this problem, we develop a dynamic-metric accelerated method for fuzzy clustering by introducing a metric matrix, whose diagonal elements consist of infinite norms of the metric matrix into the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm and its derived algorithms. More specifically, we focus on constructing a dynamic metric matrix that is used to unify the metric between data samples and updating cluster centers to optimize the search path of the cluster center. In addition, we propose a new evaluation index named the Coefficient of Variation Metric (CVM) to evaluate metric effectiveness. The dynamic metric accelerated method, whose complexity remains unchanged, can effectively accelerate the iteration speed of fuzzy clustering. The comparisons between the algorithm using the dynamic metric accelerated method and the corresponding algorithm on UCI, business district and COVID-19 CT image datasets show the superiority of the dynamic metric accelerated method in accelerating effect and clustering performance.","output":"Dynamic Metric Accelerated Method for Fuzzy Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim was to describe the organisational changes in French EDs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to architectural constraints and compare with the recommendations of the various bodies concerning the structural adjustments to be made in this context. METHODS: As part of this cross-sectional study, all heads of emergency services or their deputies were contacted to complete an electronic survey. This was a standardised online questionnaire consisting of four parts: characteristics of the responding centre, creation of the COVID-19 zone and activation of the hospitals emergency operations plan, flow and circulation of patients and, finally, staff management. Each centre was classified according to its workload related to COVID-19 and its size (university hospital centre, high-capacity hospital centre and low-capacity hospital centre). The main endpoint was the frequency of implementation of international guidelines for ED organisation. RESULTS: Between 11 May and 20 June 2020, 57 French EDs completed the online questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Twenty-eight EDs were able to separate patient flows into two zones: high and low viral density (n=28/57, 49.1%). Of the centres included, 52.6% set up a specific triage area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (n=30/57).

Hence, to avoid life-threatening challenges, all pregnant patients were electively admitted and tested for COVID-19 near term to anticipate the difficulties and prevent complications. AIM: Our aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 infection on maternal morbidity and mortality as well as the effect on the neonate under spinal anesthesia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifteen COVID-19-positive pregnant patients in the age group of 20C40 years from July 2020 to December 2020 were electively taken for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Patients who needed emergency cesarean delivery were excluded from the study. Emergency cesarean delivery was avoided to reduce the risk of aerosol generation under general anesthesia as endotracheal intubation of COVID-19 patients poses a significant risk of viral exposure to doctors and staff. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Spinal anesthesia was given at L4CL5 intervertebral space. Demographic parameters, anesthetic and surgical parameters, and neonatal parameters were observed. Any inadvertent event was noted. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were expressed as mean, median, percentage, or number. RESULTS: All pregnancies were singleton. None of the patients was converted to general anesthesia. One hundred and ten were either mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. Five of our patients had severe symptoms and needed intensive care unit care preoperatively and postoperatively. Seven patients developed spinal hypotension and were managed by vasopressors. No significant thrombocytopenia was noted in any of our patients. None of our patients developed symptomatic thromboembolism. Vertical transmission was not reported in any of the cases. All babies were born with weight >2500 g and good APGAR score.

We investigated levels of copeptin, the C-terminal segment of the vasopressin prohormone, that mirrors the production rate of vasopressin in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We measured levels of copeptin on admission and after 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8 days in 74 consecutive hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n=876) and acute or chronic bronchitis (n=371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Median admission copeptin levels in COVID-19 patients were almost 4-fold higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (49.4 pmol/L (IQR 24.9-68.9 pmol/L) vs. 13.5 pmol/L (IQR 7.0-26.7 pmol/L) resulting in an age and gender-adjusted odds ratio of 7.0 (95%CI 1.2 to 40.3), p<0.03 for mortality. Higher copeptin levels in non-survivors persisted during the short-term follow-up. Compared to the control group patients with acute/chronic bronchitis and pneumonia, COVID-19 patients did not have higher admission copeptin levels.

Results: Two major components of LI were identified as liquiritin (1) and glycyrrhizin (2); total flavones and flavonols were shown as its minor constituents. The LI (100-800 g/ml) stimulated the expression of CD69 on lymphocytes in a concentration-independent manner.

Methods: This observational comparative effectiveness study was conducted in closed administrative claims data from the US HealthVerity database (December 11, 2020-January 10, 2022, before omicron). A 2-dose mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 regimen was assessed for preventing medically-attended breakthrough COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalizations among immunocompromised adults. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline characteristics between vaccine groups. Incidence rates from patient-level data and hazard ratios (HRs) using weighted Cox proportional hazards models were calculated. Results: Overall, 57,898 and 66,981 individuals received a 2-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 or BNT161b2, respectively. Among the weighted population, mean age was 51 years, 53% were female, and baseline immunodeficiencies included prior blood transplant (8%-9%), prior organ transplant (7%), active cancer (12%-13%), primary immunodeficiency (25%-26%), HIV (20%-21%), and immunosuppressive therapy use (60%-61%). Rates per 1,000 person-years (PYs; 95% confidence intervals [CI]s) of breakthrough medically-attended COVID-19 were 25.82 (23.83-27.97) with mRNA-1273 and 30.98 (28.93, 33.18) with BNT162b2 (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.93). When requiring evidence of an antigen or polymerase chain reaction test before COVID-19 diagnosis, the HR for medically-attended COVID-19 was 0.78 (0.67-0.92). Breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalization rates per 1,000 PYs (95% CI) were 3.66 (2.96-4.51) for mRNA-1273 and 4.68 (3.91-5.59) for BNT162b2 (HR, 0.78; 0.59-1.03).

Conclusions: Among immunocompromised adults, a 2-dose mRNA-1273 regimen was more effective in preventing medically-attended COVID-19 in any setting (inpatient and outpatient) than 2-dose BNT162b2. Results were similar for COVID-19 hospitalization, although statistical power was limited when using closed claims only.

Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UKs first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown.

The outcome measures included (a) Agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments (b) Willingness to resume treatments, given the choice (c) Patients emotional reactions (d) Psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: : Due to the small number of male respondents, only female patients were included in the analysis (N=181). 43% expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines.

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and lower respiratory tract infection signs. Almost all populations are susceptible to the virus, and the basic reproduction number (R0) is 2.8-3.9. The fight against COVID-19 should have two aspects: one is the treatment of infected patients, and the other is the mobilization of the society to avoid the spread of the virus. The treatment of patients includes supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, and oxygen therapy. For patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and circulatory support are recommended. Plasma therapy and traditional Chinese medicine have also achieved good outcomes. This review is intended to summarize the research on this new coronavirus, to analyze the similarities and differences between COVID-19 and previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and to provide guidance regarding new methods of prevention, diagnosis and clinical treatment based on autodock simulations. METHODS: This review compares the multifaceted characteristics of the three coronaviruses including COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Our researchers take the COVID-19, SARS, and MERS as key words and search literatures in the Pubmed database. We compare them horizontally and vertically which respectively means concluding the individual characteristics of each coronavirus and comparing the similarities and differences between the three coronaviruses. RESULTS: We searched for studies on each outbreak and their solutions and found that the main biological differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are in ORF1a and the sequence of gene spike coding protein-S. We also found that the types and severity of clinical symptoms vary, which means that the diagnosis and nursing measures also require differentiation. In addition to the common route of transmission including airborne transmission, these three viruses have their own unique routes of transmission such as fecal-oral route of transmission COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In evolutionary history, these three coronaviruses have some similar biological features as well as some different mutational characteristics. Their receptors and routes of transmission are not all the same, which makes them different in clinical features and treatments.

However, the take-up calls were made in the face of profound disagreements on social media platforms and online networks about the value and efficacy of the vaccines. Thus, this study seeks to explore the responses of Saudi citizens to the COVID-19 vaccines and their sentiments about being vaccinated using opinion mining methods to analyze data extracted from Twitter, the most widely used social media network in Saudi Arabia. A corpus of 37,467 tweets was built. Vector space classification (VSC) methods were used to group and categorize the selected tweets based on their linguistic content, classifying the attitudes and responses of the users into three defined categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The lexical semantic properties of the posts show a prevalence of negative responses. This indicates that health departments need to ensure citizens are equipped with accurate, evidence-based information and key facts about the COVID-19 vaccines to help them make appropriate decisions when it comes to being vaccinated.

Local environmental conditions affect the expression and evolution of sexual signals and mating behaviors; changes in such traits have important evolutionary consequences because of their effect on reproduction. In this review, we synthesize research investigating how sexual communication is affected by the environmental changes associated with urbanizationincluding pollution from noise, light, and heavy metals, habitat fragmentation, impervious surfaces, urban heat islands, and changes in resources and predation. Urbanization often has negative effects on sexual communication through signal masking, altering condition\\\\dependent signal expression, and weakening female preferences. Though there are documented instances of seemingly adaptive shifts in trait expression, the ultimate impact on fitness is rarely tested. The field of urban evolution is still relatively young, and most work has tested whether differences occur in response to various aspects of urbanization. There is limited information available about whether these responses represent phenotypic plasticity or genetic changes, and the extent to which observed shifts in sexual communication affect reproductive fitness. Our understanding of how sexual selection operates in novel, urbanized environments would be bolstered by more studies that perform common garden studies and reciprocal transplants, and that simultaneously evaluate multiple environmental factors to tease out causal drivers of observed phenotypic shifts. Urbanization provides a unique testing ground for evolutionary biologists to study the interplay between ecology and sexual selection, and we suggest that more researchers take advantage of these natural experiments. Furthermore, understanding how sexual communication and mating systems differ between cities and rural areas can offer insights on how to mitigate negative, and accentuate positive, consequences of urban expansion on the biota, and provide new opportunities to underscore the relevance of evolutionary biology in the Anthropocene.","output":"How urbanization affects sexual communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The optimal time to initiate renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury is controversial. We investigated the effect of such earlier versus later initiation of renal replacement therapy on the primary outcome of 28-day mortality and other patient-centered secondary outcomes. DESIGN We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to July 17, 2020, and included randomized controlled trials comparing earlier versus later renal replacement therapy. SETTING Multiple centers involved in eight trials. PATIENTS Total of 4,588 trial participants. INTERVENTION Two independents investigators screened and extracted data using a predefined form. We selected randomized controlled trials in critically ill adult patients with acute kidney injury and compared of earlier versus later initiation of renal replacement therapy regardless of modality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Overall, 28-day mortality was similar between earlier and later renal replacement therapy initiation (38.43% vs 38.06%, respectively; risk ratio, 1.01; [95% CI, 0.94-1.09]; I = 0%). Earlier renal replacement therapy, however, shortened hospital length of stay (mean difference, -2.14 d; [95% CI, -4.13 to -0.14]) and ICU length of stay (mean difference, -1.18 d; [95% CI, -1.95 to -0.42]). In contrast, later renal replacement therapy decreased the use of renal replacement therapy (relative risk, 0.69; [95% CI, 0.58-0.82]) and lowered the risk of catheter-related blood stream infection (risk ratio, 0.50, [95% CI, 0.29-0.86). Among survivors, renal replacement therapy dependence at day 28 was similar between earlier and later renal replacement therapy initiation (risk ratio, 0.98; [95% CI, 0.66-1.40]). CONCLUSIONS Earlier or later initiation of renal replacement therapy did not affect mortality. However, earlier renal replacement therapy was associated with significantly shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, whereas later renal replacement therapy was associated with decreased use of renal replacement therapy and decreased risk of catheter-related blood stream infection.

However, we report a case of Coxsackie induced ADEM that remitted but got exacerbated by COVID-19 infection. The patient contracted the COVID-19 infection shortly after being discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Direct COVID-19 neuroinvasion was ruled out via CSF PCR testing for the virus. The patient responded well to pulse steroid therapy and plasmapheresis in both occasions. We hypothesize that COVID-19 infection can flare-up a recently remitted ADEM via altering the immune responses. It is known now that COVID-19 infection can produce cytokine storming. Cytokine pathway activation is known to be involved in the pathology of ADEM.

Here, we characterized in vitro A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015, an H5N6 avian influenza virus recently isolated from cats. A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015 replicated to high titers and caused CPE in feline kidney cells. We determined that infection with A/feline/Guangdong/1/2015 did not activate the IFN- promoter, but inhibited it by blocking the activation of NF-B and IRF3. We also determined that the viral NS1 protein mediated the block, and that the dsRNA binding domain of NS1 was essential to perform this function. In contrast to treatment after infection, cells pretreated with IFN- suppressed viral replication. Our findings provide an example of an H5N6 influenza virus suppressing IFN production, which might be associated with interspecies transmission of avian influenza viruses to cats.","output":"The NS1 protein of H5N6 feline influenza virus inhibits feline beta interferon response by preventing NF-B and IRF3 activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human bronchial epithelium is the first line of defense against atmospheric particles, pollutants, and respiratory pathogens such as the novel SARS-CoV-2. The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.","output":"Long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome in preclinical 3D models of the human bronchial epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic Understanding South Asians awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region Methods We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative Results Participants were 61% female, mean age 45 1 years Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%) Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%) Key preventive measures were not widely adopted Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications;40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9 3% to 39 4% (P&lt;0 001), and household income fell by 52% (P&lt;0 001) during the lockdown Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P&lt;0 001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P&lt;0 001), during the lockdown Conclusions Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor","output":"Low uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviours and high socioeconomic impact of lockdown measures in South Asia: evidence from a large-scale multi-country surveillance programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract ORF5 sequences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were analysed to determine genetic diversity, codon usage, positive and negative selection sites and potential changes in the predicted glycoprotein 5 (GP5).

These sequences corresponded to isolates obtained 10 years apart (1991C1995, 18 strains) and a second set (n =46) from 2000 to 2005. Similarity to Lelystad virus (LV) decreased from 95.5% in 1991C1995 to 89.5% in 2000C2005. Three highly variable regions were found in ORF5. Codon usage was different in both sets for leucine, glutamine, serine and proline. Thus, 2000C2005 sequences used codons more similar to those present in highly expressed pig genes compared to the 1991C1995 set. Twenty four sites of positive selection and 20 sites of negative selection were found in GP5, most of them in transmembrane regions. Additional glycosylation in N37 of GP5 was common in 2000C2005 but some sequences lack a glycosylation site in N46. The hypothetical GP5 was only 88.1% similar to LV and was less hydrophobic.

Evolution model considers the possibility of infections from asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized individuals. Evolution model considers the possibility that individuals who have recovered from the disease become symptomatic again. Observation model accounts for underreport of cases and deaths. Observation model accounts for delays in reporting cases and deaths. Model parameters were initially estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by using the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro from February 28, 2020 to April 29, 2020. These estimations were used as initial input values for the solution of the state estimation problem for the city of Rio de Janeiro. Algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter was used for the solution of the state estimation problem because it allows the simultaneous estimation of state variables and model parameters. State estimation problem was solved with the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from February 28, 2020 to May 05, 2020. Monte Carlo simulations were run for 20 future days, considering uncertainties in the model parameters and state variables. Initial conditions were given by the state variables and corresponding distributions estimated with the particle filter on May 05, 2020. Distributions of the model parameters were also given by the estimations obtained for this date. Data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from May 06, 2020 to May 15, 2020, were used for the validation of the solution of the state estimation problem. The present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem. The Ratio of Infected Individuals per Reported Cases was around 15 on May 05, 2020. The Indexes of Under-Reported Cases and Deaths were around 12 and 2, respectively, on May 05, 2020.

In platelets, the interaction of thrombin with its receptor initiates the degradation of phosphatidylinositol by the action of a specific phospholipase C (refs 4C8). In normal conditions of stimulation, the resultant 1,2-diacylglycerol is rapidly and completely phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid(4C11). The formation of phosphatidic acid precedes the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids of stimulated platelets(5). This early appearence of phosphatidate might result in the initial production of arachidonic acid and lysophosphatidic acid by the action of a phospholipase A(2) specific for phosphatidate(12). Phosphatidate/lysophosphatidate could induce calciumgating(13C15) and subsequently stimulate phospholipases of the A(2)-type(8), that degrade phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and a further fraction of phosphatidylinositol(6). Alternatively, the lysophosphatidate produced may serve as a substrate for the transfer of arachidonate directly from other phospholipids(16,17) to form new phosphatidate which in turn can release more arachidonate. Overall, such a sequence would be equivalent to phospholipase A(2) activation of other phospholipids. Our present data indicate that when the release of arachidonic acid is completely inhibited by cyclic AMP or quinacrine, phosphatidic acid is redirected entirely to phosphatidylinositol and there is no production of arachidonate. In these conditions, the availability of calcium might be profoundly restricted. The correlation in platelets of a phosphatidylinositol by a specific phospholipase A(2) might suggest that these phenomena are applicable to activations in other cell systems.","output":"The phosphatidylinositol cycle and the regulation of arachidonic acid production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and ethnodemographic correlates of serological responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein following mild-to-moderate COVID-19. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had self-isolated due to COVID-19. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK (UHBFT). PARTICIPANTS: 956 healthcare workers were recruited by open invitation via UHBFT trust email and social media between 27 April 2020 and the 8 June 2020. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of their original illness and ethnodemographic variables. RESULTS: Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG, IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2% (n=442/956). The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3%, 18.7% and 8.1% for IgG, IgA and IgM, respectively. IgGAM identified serological responses in 40.6% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a positive predictive value of 92.3% for seropositivity in self-isolating individuals a time when Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 was predominant.

Firstly, this study explores why SM is being used by physicians to cross horizontal (physician to physician) and stakeholder (physician to patient) boundaries prior to COVID-19. Secondly, based on the studies reviewed, this study provides insights on the practical SM implications for physician leaders working in the COVID-19 environment to actively enhance their practices, reduce public confusion and improve patient care, thus informing health-care practices. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A systematic literature review was used to conduct a structured transparent overview of peer reviewed articles that describe physicians' use of cross-boundary SM across several disciplines (e.g. health, information science). As a baseline assessment prior to COVID-19, the review synthesized 47 articles, identified and selected from six databases and Novanet. This study used NVivo 12 to thematical code the articles, leading to the emergence of four broad factors that influence SM use. FINDINGS: A key reason noted in the literature for physicians use of SM to cross horizontal boundaries is to share knowledge. Regarding stakeholder boundaries, the most cited reasons are to improve patient's health and encourage behavioural changes. Insights garnered on the practical SM implications include the need for physicians to be stronger leaders in presenting trustworthy and consistent facts about health information to the public and fellow peers. As role models for the effective use of SM tools, physician leaders can mentor and coach their colleagues and counterparts. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: As this was a literature review, the authors did not collect primary data to further explore this rapidly changing and dynamic SM world. Next steps could include a survey to determine firstly, how physicians currently use SM in this COVID-19 environment, and secondly, how they could leverage it for their work. Findings from this survey will help us better understand the role of physician leaders as health-care influencers and how they could better create trust and inform the Canadian public in the health information that is being conveyed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physician leaders can play a key role in positively influencing institutional support for ethical and safe SM use and engagement practices. Physicians need to participate in developing regulations and guidelines that are fundamentally to physician leader's SM use. Central to this research would be the need to understand how physicians cross-boundary practices have changed during and potentially post COVID-19. Physician leaders also need to monitor information sources for credibility and ensure that these sources are protected. As role models for the effective use of SM tools, physician leaders can mentor and coach their colleagues and counterparts in this area. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Although there have been studies of how physicians use SM, fewer studies explore why physician leaders' cross boundaries (horizontal and stakeholder) using SM. Important insights are gained in physician leaders practical use of SM. Key themes that emerged included: organizational and individual, information, professional and regulations and guideline factors. These factors strengthen physician leaders understanding of areas of foci to enhance their cross-boundary interactions. There is an urgency to study the complexity of SM and the effectiveness of regulations and guidelines for physicians, who are being required, at an accelerated rate, to strengthen and increase their cross-boundary practices.","output":"Physician leaders' cross-boundary use of social media: what are the implications in the current COVID-19 environment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Social media allow users to quickly spread information and opinions. Unfortunately, it is often a place of anti-vaxxers activity, who create content that spreads easily. This situation leads to an increase in vaccine hesitancy and may result in outbreaks of infectious diseases. We wanted to find and characterize what negative arguments against the COVID-19 vaccines Facebook users create and how the popularity of the allegations against vaccines changes over time. Methods We followed the posts published on Facebook by the biggest Polish media. We have selected the highest commented events related to the registration and introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines. Then, we analyzed user comments related to those events and established the main themes of anti-vaccine comments. Using this list of topics, we categorized 3414 comments and checked the frequency of comments from given categories and their variability over time. Results The arguments of vaccine opponents about the COVID-19 vaccines can be divided into 12 categories. Seven of them also apply to other vaccines but five types are COVID-19' specific. Two new arguments say that vaccines were not properly tested or do not exist. The third topic mentions the history of the swine flu vaccine and the following narcolepsy cases. The fourth category suggests that vaccine against COVID-19 existed before the pandemic. The last argument says that no one takes responsibility for the side effects of the vaccine. The frequency of arguments from a given category varies over time. We also noticed that, while the comments were mostly negative, the reactions were positive. Conclusions Our codebook of anti-vaccine topics can help public health professionals better understand social media content. Real-time monitoring of social media is important because the popularity of certain arguments on Facebook changes rapidly over time but early recognition of social doubts allows for targeted interventions.

During the Covid-19 pandemic the seminar program of the KWBW-Verbundweiterbildung(plus?) in Baden-Wrttemberg was converted to digital formats. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the acceptance by the GP-trainees and lecturers, to describe experiences with the conversion to e-learning and to derive recommendations with regard to the future orientation of seminar programs in post-graduate as well as continuing medical education. The implementation was based on a modified Kern-cycle and aimed at offering eight teaching units of 45 minutes each to a large number of GP-trainees. It tried to maintain the high quality of content and education as well as the interactive character of the previous seminars. For this purpose, the events were designed as synchronous webinars (six units) with asynchronous preparation and post-processing (two units) according to the flipped classroom method. The evaluation by the participating GP-trainees and lecturers was performed online using a multi-center developed and pre-piloted questionnaire. Results and discussion: N=101 GP-trainees participated in the evaluation of five individual seminar days in the second quarter of 2020 (response rate 97%). 58% (N=59) of the trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the implementation. 82% (n=83) rated pre-tasks as helpful. 99% (n=100) would participate in an online seminar again. For 52% (n=53) of the trainees, the attitude towards e-learning had changed positively. The main advantages mentioned were no travel, save in time and costs as well as increased flexibility. The main disadvantages mentioned were less personal interaction and technical obstacles. The high acceptance of the new digital format showed the fundamental potential of e-learning in continuing medical education. The experiences can be a source of inspiration for other departments and KW.

While many lines have proven to be useful for investigating gene function, many have also shown no apparent phenotype, or phenotypes not of interest to the originating lab. In order for labs to document and share information about these lines, we have created ZebraShare as a new resource offered within ZFIN. METHODS: ZebraShare involves a form-based submission process generated by ZFIN. The ZebraShare interface (https://zfin.org/action/zebrashare) can be accessed on ZFIN under Submit Data. Users download the Submission Workbook and complete the required fields, then submit the completed workbook with associated images and captions, generating a new ZFIN publication record. ZFIN curators add the submitted phenotype and mutant information to the ZFIN database, provide mapping information about mutations, and cross reference this information across the appropriate ZFIN databases. We present here examples of ZebraShare submissions, including phf21aa, kdm1a, ctnnd1, snu13a, and snu13b mutant lines. RESULTS: Users can find ZebraShare submissions by searching ZFIN for specific alleles or line designations, just as for alleles submitted through the normal process. We present several potential examples of submission types to ZebraShare including a phenotypic mutants, mildly phenotypic, and early lethal mutants. Mutants for kdm1a show no apparent skeletal phenotype, and phf21aa mutants show only a mild skeletal phenotype, yet these genes have specific human disease relevance and therefore may be useful for further studies. The p120-catenin encoding gene, ctnnd1, was knocked out to investigate a potential role in brain development or function. The homozygous ctnnd1 mutant disintegrates during early somitogenesis and the heterozygote has localized defects, revealing vital roles in early development. Two snu13 genes were knocked out to investigate a role in muscle formation. The snu13a;snu13b double mutant has an early embryonic lethal phenotype, potentially related to a proposed role in the core splicing complex. In each example, the mutants submitted to ZebraShare display phenotypes that are not ideally suited to their originating labs project directions but may be of great relevance to other researchers. CONCLUSION: ZebraShare provides an opportunity for researchers to directly share information about mutant lines within ZFIN, which is widely used by the community as a central database of information about zebrafish lines.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of all current recalls, market withdrawals, and safety alerts published by the United States Food and Drug Administration pertaining to drugs was conducted. A manual review of all the recalls was also conducted to extract additional information including company details, recall type (labeling or quality), and location of failure in the pharmaceutical supply chain (manufacturing or distribution). Descriptive statistics and exploratory bivariate analyses were conducted to test any potential differences between drug and device recalls. RESULTS: Most recalls issued between January 2017 and September 2019 were pharmaceutical drug recalls (85.2%), while 34 (14.8%) medical device recalls were issued for the same period. For drug recalls, 85.1% (166/195) were because of quality, while 14.9% (29/195) were because of labeling issues. Of the quality issues for drug recalls, lack of sterility was the most frequent issue (139/166, 83.7%). There was no difference between drug or device recalls based on recall type (P = 0.16), top 20 pharmaceutical company (P = 0.62), or location of the supply chain failure (P = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a process to categorize and evaluate drug and device recalls by recall type and location of the supply chain.

Multiple efforts are ongoing to control COVID19 pandemic, and clinical practice is being adapted at the same time as the pandemic progresses around the world. To reduce unnecessary in-person appointments has become crucial to minimize hospital exposition. Digital technologies allow us to perform real-time monitoring of patients' clinical status. A real-time patient monitoring system through the use of a smartphone application and wearable devices was implemented at our Center during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods Since March 2020, a real time patient monitoring system was implemented at our HCT program. All consecutive adults patients transplanted between April 2020 and July 2020 were considered for the study. Vital signs and relevant clinical information were reported during 14 consecutive days after being discharged, through the online platform provided by Trilema Fundation (saludencasa.trilema.org, Fundacin Trilema, Valencia, Spain). Vital signs (cardiac frequency, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) were measured with validated oxymeters (Onyx II?, Nonin Inc, Plymouth MN USA) and blood pressure monitors (iHealth Track?, Mountain View, CA USA). Temperature was measured through domiciliary thermometers. Patients were educated to measure their respiratory frequency. A checklist of clinical symptoms was filled daily. An analogue visual scale (0-10) to detect potential cases of anxiety or depressive disorders was reported daily. Scores of >6 were evaluated by a psycho-oncologist through videoconference. All the data were reported to the online platform using a smartphone app compatible with iPhone and Android systems. A direct chat between patients and physician was available through the app. Clinical information was daily supervised by an experienced HCT hematologist. Clinical interventions were arranged if significant clinical abnormalities were documented. A hematologist with experience in HCT patients revised all the patients data daily. Programmed alarms were set in case of any of the following situations: fever >38 oC; oxygen saturation <92%; tachicardia >125/bpm, hypotension (sytolic<90 mmHg, diastolic > 60 mmHg; altered mental status; persistent emesis or diarrhea). Patients satisfaction questionnaires were evaluated individually after finalizing the 14-days clinical monitoring. Results During the study period, 21 adults underwent HCT and 16 were s were eligible to be recruited into the study (80% feasibility) with team effort and without additional costs. Reasons for not being enrolled were: language incompatibility (1 patient), no consent (1 patient), not compatible smartphone (3 patients). Of the 16 enrolled patients, median age was 50 (range 22-70 years), 37% were female and 94% had lymphoid diseases. Thirty-eight percent of HCTs were autologous and 62% allogeneic. Of the 16 enrolled patients, 25% were not able to adequately use the app due to inability in using smartphone applications. Of the remaining 12 patients, adherence in reporting study data (number of days reported of the planned 14 days study period) was as follows (average): temperature 89%, oxygen saturation 90%, respiratory frequency 70%, cardiac frequency 85%, blood pressure 89%, symptoms reporting 65%, emotional distress 71%. Automatic alarms were activated only 3 times: twice for the presence of clinical symptoms and once, for emotional distress. A videoconference with the psycho-oncologist was requested by one patient only. The chat service to communicate with hospital personnel was used in 4 patients. Data collected with the digital system helped the clinician to early recognize arterial hypertension (1 patient) and acute cutaneous GVHD grade 1 (1 patient). Only two patients of the whole cohort were readmitted within 14 days from discharge due to grade 4 odynophagia due to HSV1/2 reactivation. Patients experiences with telehealth systems are reported in table 1. Conclusion Telehealth monitoring can potentially improve patient's follow-up in terms of both physical and psychological outcomes.

Cellular cryo-ET images help in resolving the structures of macromolecules and determining their spatial relationship in a single cell, which has broad significance in cell and structural biology. Subtomogram classification and recognition constitute a primary step in the systematic recovery of these macromolecular structures. Supervised deep learning methods have been proven to be highly accurate and efficient for subtomogram classification, but suffer from limited applicability due to scarcity of annotated data. While generating simulated data for training supervised models is a potential solution, a sizeable difference in the image intensity distribution in generated data as compared to real experimental data will cause the trained models to perform poorly in predicting classes on real subtomograms. In this work, we present Cryo-Shift, a fully unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization framework for deep learning-based cross-domain subtomogram classification. We use unsupervised multi-adversarial domain adaption to reduce the domain shift between features of simulated and experimental data. We develop a network-driven domain randomization procedure with \`warp' modules to alter the simulated data and help the classifier generalize better on experimental data. We do not use any labeled experimental data to train our model, whereas some of the existing alternative approaches require labeled experimental samples for cross-domain classification. Nevertheless, Cryo-Shift outperforms the existing alternative approaches in cross-domain subtomogram classification in extensive evaluation studies demonstrated herein using both simulated and experimental data.","output":"Cryo-shift: Reducing domain shift in cryo-electron subtomograms with unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital transformation, a term introduced to talk about the various changes in business and society due to the increased usage of digital technologies, has recently gained much attention both in research and in practice.

METHODS: A web-based education program was prepared in line with patient needs, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinions and tested with 10 cancer patients. The single-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted at a medical oncology unit of a university hospital. Pretests were applied to 60 cancer patients undergoing treatment with systemic chemotherapy, and the patients (intervention: 30, control: 30) were randomized. The intervention group used a web-based education program for 3 months, and they were allowed to communicate with researchers 24/7 via the website. The efficacy of a web-based education program at baseline and after 12 weeks was evaluated. The CONSORT 2010 guideline was performed. RESULTS: In the first phase results of the study, it was found that most of the patients with cancer wanted to receive education about symptom management and the side effects of the treatment. Expert opinions on the developed website were found to be compatible with each other (Kendalls Wa = 0.233, p = 0.008). According to the randomized controlled study results, patients who received web-based education reported significantly fewer symptoms (p = 0.026) and better quality of life (p = 0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference in the self-efficacy and depression levels during the 3-month follow-up period (p?0.05). The most frequently visited links in the web-based education program by the patients with cancer were the management of chemotherapy-related symptoms (62.6%). CONCLUSION: A web-based education program was found to be efficacy in remote symptom management and improving the quality of life of cancer patients.

METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective, comparative cohort study. Patients with RA-associated PUK were divided into two groups; those exposed to and those not exposed to early IMT, defined as administrating therapy within the first 4 weeks from the PUK onset. Outcomes included PUK recurrence, control of inflammation and development of ocular complications, including corneal scarring and perforation, cataract formation or progression and permanent visual loss. RESULTS: A total of 52 eyes from 36 patients were included for analysis; 37 (71.2%) eyes received early IMT and 15 (28.8%) eyes did not. Follow-up time was 41.2+53.3 months (range: 4-236 months). While early IMT was a protective factor (HR 0.345, 95% CI 0.126 to 0.946, p=0.039), late RA diagnosis after PUK onset (HR 4.93, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.85, p=0.002) and retarded (2 months) control of inflammation (HR 8.37, 95% CI 1.88 to 37.16, p=0.005) were risk factors for PUK recurrence.

Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how data reshapes international economic relations. This paper explores various aspects of data politics through the lens of Chinas digital rise and the countrys global engagement. I start with the theoretical premise that data differs from traditional strategic assets (e.g., land, oil, and labor), in that it is nonrival and partially excludable. These characteristics have generated externality, commitment, and valuation problems, triggering three fundamental changes in Chinas external economic relations. First, datas externality problem makes it necessary for states to regulate data or even to pursue data sovereignty. However, clashes over data sovereignty can ignite conflicts between China and other countries. Second, the commitment problem in data use raises global concerns about foreign government surveillance. As data is easier to transfer across borders than physical commodities, Chinese tech companies investments abroad are vulnerable to national security investigations by foreign regulators. Chinese tech companies, therefore, confront a deep versus broad dilemma: deep ties with the Chinese government help promote their domestic business but jeopardize their international expansion. Lastly, datas valuation problem makes traditional measures (e.g., GDP) ill-suited to measure the relative strengths of the worlds economies, which may distort perceptions of China and other states.","output":"The Rise of Data Politics: Digital China and the World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thermodynamic methods are finding more and more applications in systems biology, which attempts to understand cell functions mechanistically. Unfortunately, the state variables used (reaction enthalpy and Gibbs energy) do not take sufficient account of the conditions inside of cells, especially the crowding with macromolecules. METHODS: For this reason, the influence of crowding agents and various other parameters such as salt concentrations, pH and temperature on equilibrium position and reaction enthalpy of the glycolytic example reaction 9 (2-Phospoglycerate - > Phosphoenolpyruvate + H2O) was investigated. The conditions were chosen to be as close as possible to the cytosolic conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) MW = 20,000 g mol-1 (PEG 20,000) was used to analyze the influence of crowding with macromolecules. The equation of state electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT) was applied to consider the influence of crowding agents on the reaction equilibria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: For the reaction enthalpies and for the equilibria, it was found that the influence of salts and temperature is not pronounced while that of pH and PEG 20,000 concentration is considerable. Furthermore, it could be shown that under identical measurement conditions there are no differences between the van 't Hoff and the calorimetrically determined reaction enthalpy.

METHODS We established animal models by injecting intracardially in athymic nude fox1nu mice two human melanoma cell lines, originating from a cerebral metastasis (HM19) and a cerebellar metastasis (HM86). RESULTS Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), metastases were first detected after a mean of 34.5 days. Mean survival time was 59.6 days for the mice in the HM86 group and significantly shorter (43.7 days) for HM19-injected animals (p < 0.001). In the HM86 group, the first detectable metastasis was located in the cerebellum in 15/55 (29%) mice compared with none in the HM19 group (p < 0.001). At sacrifice, cerebellar metastases were found in 34/55 (63%) HM86-injected mice compared with 1/53 (2%) in the HM19-injected (p < 0.001) mice. At that time, all mice in both groups had detectable metastases in the cerebrum. Comparing macroscopic and histologic appearances of the brain metastases with their clinical counterparts, the cell line-based tumors had kept their original morphologic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS The present work demonstrates that human brain-metastatic melanoma cells injected intracardially in mice had retained inherent characteristics also in reproducing interaction with subtle microenvironmental brain tissue compartment-specific features.

We present results of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in Warsaw, Poland. Some of the pediatric subjects were also PCR-tested for RSV, and A and B influenza. We compared the test results from the four groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects: 459 symptomatic pediatric patients (children 0C18 years old), 1774 symptomatic adults, 445 asymptomatic children, and 239 asymptomatic adults. 3.26% (15/459) of symptomatic pediatric patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to 5.58% (99/1774) of symptomatic adults (p = 0.0448). There were no SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the group of asymptomatic children (0/445) and two positive cases in the group of asymptomatic adults (2/239), i.e., 0.83%.

It was interesting to note that RBD entrapped PLA nanoparticle with aluminum hydroxide not only generated robust and long-lasting antibody response but also provided Th1 and Th2 balanced immune response. Moreover, challenge with 1 g of RBD alone was able to generate secondary antibody response, suggesting that immunization with RBD-PLA nanoparticles has the ability to elicit memory antibody against RBD.

Here, we examine the level of support for border closings among citizens from eight Western democracies, how support developed over time, and how particular COVID-19-related concerns and considerations predict individual differences in support. Specifically, we collected data on support for tightened border security from 9 April 2020 until 19 December 2020 in quota-sampled online surveys in Denmark, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Hungary. Eight Western democracies that differ in their response to and the impact of COVID-19 (N = 67,679). Overall, the data show moderate to high levels of support for tightened border security across all observed countries, with substantial within-country variation. Furthermore, the analyses show that support for border security relates to both usual predictors of anti-immigration views and corona-specific considerations, in particular, personal concerns about the adverse effects of COVID-19 and attributions of blame to international actors such as China and WHO.

METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report survey methodology was used to gather the following data from Chinese citizens: sociodemographic information, physical and mental health disorder history, daily online time, social media exposure, feeling toward social media exposure, perception of the disease, infection cases in the local area, and previous experiences with stressful life incidents. Levels of anxiety and depression were self-reported employing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 6130 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 7.1 and 12%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that psychological disturbances were associated with gender, people with religious background, being a medical professional, having physical or mental health disease, difficulty accessing medical aids, experience with traumatic incidents, the perceived possibility of sequelae after being cured of COVID-19, daily online time, the source of the information relevant to COVID-19, frequency of receiving information regarding COVID-19, and negative feelings triggered by social media. CONCLUSIONS: There needs to be a consistent message from authorities to reduce the panic and confusion of the public, and to decrease public exposure to persistently negative information. It is necessary to help people transform their negative experiences into positive changes especially for individuals with physical illness, individuals with mental health disorders, and medical professionals.","output":"The psychological burden experienced by Chinese citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak: prevalence and determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current tensions between the US and China center around a race for technological supremacy, and this technological race raises the stakes for all investors: it increases investment risk and requires further analysis on potential impact and opportunity While the technology race between China and the United States could hinder US-China collaboration and slow global climate change cooperation as a result, it could also produce flurries of innovation in areas such as technology, clean energy and biotech, as well as more rapid solutions to pandemics as are being experienced in 2020 from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ?

Given the contradictory results of the impact of DM on the natural history of pulmonary TB (PTB), this study was undertaken to shed light on the precision of this hypothesis from a community with a substantial caseload of both diseases. METHODS: The present 5-year, retrospective, cohort study involved 487 (60.8% males, and 39.2% females) adult PTB patients (mean age 53.71  15.78 years) selected from Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital (DSFH), Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The relevant patients clinical, radiological and microbiological data were extracted from the hospital medical and laboratory database. RESULTS: In our study, the cumulative prevalence of DM among PTB subjects was 27.1%. Both diabetic and non-diabetic groups were matched with regard to gender (p = 0.46); however, diabetic patients were significantly older (p = 0.0001). Patients with concomitant DM displayed higher frequency of the classic clinical presentations of PTB and were 1.8 times more likely to have cavitary lesions on imaging studies (p = 0.012). Furthermore, diabetic patients showed higher initial sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear grade (p = 0.0001) and were more prone to have delayed culture conversion as compared to their non-diabetic counterparts (77.55  37.74 versus 54.95  27.67 days, respectively; p = 0.0001) which points out to less favorable treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: DM showed an impact on different aspects of PTB.

Lack of locally available medical infrastructure, socioeconomic barriers, social marginalization, poor health literacy, and cultural barriers prevent patients from accessing surgical and rehabilitative care. Overcoming these barriers is an insurmountable challenge for the most vulnerable and marginalized, resulting in absence of treatment or even death. METHODS: Sundar Dhoka Saathi Sewa (SDSS), a non-government organization, provides a patient navigation service which facilitates referrals to tertiary centers from Nepals most remote areas. Specific criteria ensure that patient referrals are appropriate in regard to clinical and socioeconomic need, while comprehensive counselling helps guide the patient and family. The SDSS staff meet patients upon arrival in Kathmandu and facilitate admission to the appropriate tertiary hospital. They advocate for the patient, provide medicine, supply food and cover all treatment costs. RESULTS: This project has enabled access to treatment for more than 1200 children for conditions leading to long-term disability and/or congenital heart disease. Interventions include a wide range of surgical and rehabilitative procedures such as complex orthopedics, cleft lip and palate, congenital talipes equinovarus, burn contractures, neurological cases, and cardiac surgery for valvular disease, septal defects and other congenital malformations. DISCUSSION: The SDSS model of patient navigation is effective in overcoming the barriers to access surgical care and rehabilitation in Nepal. The success is owed to committed international donors, capacity building, effective counselling, advocacy, compassion, and community. We believe that this model could be replicated in other LMICs.","output":"Overcoming Barriers to Accessing Surgery and Rehabilitation in Low and Middle-Income Countries: An Innovative Model of Patient Navigation in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have included travel bans and social distancing with \\"shelter in place\\" orders, resulting in sudden changes in human activity and subsequent effects on the global and national economy. We speculate that animal health will likely be impacted by COVID-19 through the immediate consequences of sudden human confinement and inactivity, and through the long-term consequences of the upcoming economic crisis on farmer livelihoods and veterinary service capacities. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis to impact negatively on the control of diseases that are already present in Europe, as well as on the European capacity to prevent and respond in a timely manner to new and emerging animal diseases. We also expect an increased attention to the animal health implications of coronavirus infections in animals. Mechanisms explaining these outcomes include increased wildlife-livestock contacts due to human confinement; disruption of ongoing testing schemes for endemic diseases; lower disease surveillance efforts; and lower capacity for managing populations of relevant wildlife reservoirs. The main mitigation action consists in adapting animal health management strategies to the available resources.","output":"COVID-19 is likely to impact animal health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-translational modification of proteins mediated by SIZ1, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, regulates multiple biological processes in plants. However, its role in the regulation of lateral root formation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the apple SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 promotes lateral root formation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the auxin response factor MdARF8 was screened out as a protein-protein interaction partner of the SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme MdSCE1, indicating that MdARF8 may be a substrate for MdSIZ1. The interaction between MdARF8 and MdSCE1 was confirmed by pull-down, Y2H, and Co-IP assays. MdSIZ1 enhanced the conjugating enzyme activity of MdSCE1 to form a MdSCE1-MdSIZ1-MdARF8 complex, thereby facilitating SUMO modification. We identified two arginine substitution mutations at K342 and K380 in MdARF8 that blocked MdSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, indicating that K342 and K380 are the principal SUMOylation sites of the MdARF8 protein. Moreover, MdARF8 promoted lateral root formation in transgenic apple plants, and the phenotype of reduced lateral roots in the Arabidopsis siz1-2 mutant was restored in siz1-2/MdARF8 complementary plants. Our findings reveal an important role for sumoylation in the regulation of lateral root formation in plants.","output":"Apple SUMO E3 ligase MdSIZ1 facilitates SUMOylation of MdARF8 to regulate lateral root formation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of combined coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve (MV) repair using a robotic totally endoscopic right-sided approach.

They are well established in earthquake modelling or finance and their application is spreading to diverse areas. Most models from the literature have two major drawbacks regarding their potential application to insurance. First, they use an exponentially-decaying form of excitation, which does not allow a delay between the occurrence of an event and its excitation effect on the process and does not fit well on insurance data consequently. Second, theoretical results developed from these models are valid only when time of observation tends to infinity, whereas the time horizon for an insurance use case is of several months or years. In this paper, we define a complete framework of Hawkes processes with a Gamma density excitation function (i.e. estimation, simulation, goodness-of-fit) instead of an exponential-decaying function and we demonstrate some mathematical properties (i.e. expectation, variance) about the transient regime of the process.

Whether the RYGB is feasible in an ambulatory setting (same-day discharge) without overnight hospital stay remains to be answered. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of same-day discharge after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) using additional live video consultation and remote monitoring. Same-day discharge (SDD) was defined as surgery without postoperative overnight hospital stay. METHODS: This was a single-center prospective feasibility study in a selected group of patients undergoing a RYGB. Fifty patients undergoing a primary RYGB were selected and potentially treated following the SDD protocol. After SDD discharge patients were remotely monitored after surgery for 48 h using a medical device measuring vital signs three times a day. Video consultations were performed by a doctor twice a day for 2 postoperative days. Primary outcome was the success rate (%) of SDD. Secondary outcomes were emergency room presentations, readmissions, early complications (<30 days), and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were selected for the SDD treatment protocol between June 2020 and November 2020. An SDD success rate of 88 % (44/50 patients) was achieved. Five patients (10%) presented at the emergency room, 2 of whom (4%) were readmitted because of a complication within 30 days after surgery. Overall, patients who followed the SDD protocol reported high satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: A RYGB with SDD can be considered feasible using remote monitoring for a selected group of patients.

The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged populations underscores the need to anticipate and address social inequalities and health disparities in AI development and application. Before the pandemic, there was growing optimism about AI's role in addressing inequities and enhancing personalized care. Unfortunately, ethical and social issues that are encountered in scaling, developing, and applying advanced technologies in health care settings have intensified during the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Critical voices concerned with the disruptive potentials and risk for engineered inequities have called for reexamining ethical guidelines in the development and application of AI.

METHODS: Observational study using data collected from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. We evaluated the epidemiological, radiological and analytical scenario between patients treated with megadoses therapy of corticosteroids vs low-dose of corticosteroids and the development of complications. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality according to use of corticosteroids megadoses. RESULTS: Of a total of 14,921 patients, corticosteroids were used in 5,262 (35.3%). Of them, 2,216 (46%) specifically received megadoses. Age was a factor that differed between those who received megadoses therapy versus those who did not in a significant manner (69 years [IQR 59C79] vs 73 years [IQR 61C83]; p < .001). Radiological and analytical findings showed a higher use of megadoses therapy among patients with an interstitial infiltrate and elevated inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19. In the univariate study it appears that steroid use is associated with increased mortality (OR 2.07 95% CI 1.91C2.24 p < .001) and megadose use with increased survival (OR 0.84 95% CI 0.75C0.96, p 0.011), but when adjusting for possible confounding factors, it is observed that the use of megadoses is also associated with higher mortality (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.32C1.80; p < .001).

Although the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 infection has gained attention, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we showed that the ectopic expression of gga-miR-30c-5p in leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells enhanced apoptosis in FAdV-4-infected LMH cells by directly targeting the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), facilitating viral replication. On the contrary, the inhibition of endogenous gga-miR-30c-5p markedly suppressed apoptosis and viral replication in LMH cells. Importantly, the overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited gga-miR-30c-5p or FAdV-4-induced apoptosis in LMH cells, reducing FAdV-4 replication, while the knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNAi enhanced apoptosis in LMH cells. Furthermore, transfection of LMH cells with gga-miR-30c-5p mimics enhanced FAdV-4-induced apoptosis associated with increased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Thus, gga-miR-30c-5p enhances FAdV-4-induced apoptosis by directly targeting Mcl-1, a cellular anti-apoptotic protein, facilitating FAdV-4 replication in host cells.

Perioperative mortality and morbidity were 0% and 6.2%, respectively. Recovery after the procedure was rapid, and the mean hospital stay was 6.8 days (range, 3 to 22 days). Pathology revealed 12 lesions compatible with a mucinous cystadenoma and four others compatible with benign cystic tumors. All surgical margins were clear. In one case, an extra port had to be placed, and another case required conversion from SILS to a standard open laparotomy immediately after identification of the tumor because of a micro-perforation with focal mucin collection. With a median follow-up of 28.7 months, no re-admission or tumor recurrence, such as pseudomyxoma peritonei, was noted in 14 patients. CONCLUSION A single-port laparoscopic mucocelectomy should be safe and feasible and has the advantage of being a minimally invasive approach. Prospective controlled studies comparing SILS and conventional open surgery, with long-term follow-up evaluation, are needed to confirm the author's initial experience.","output":"Single-incision Laparoscopic Surgery for Appendiceal Mucoceles: Safety and Feasibility in a Series of 16 Consecutive Cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on ethnographic research, this article explores the multifaceted, situational and shifting social boundaries in the translocational positionalities of middle-class Swiss migrants in China.

Since BCV infection is limited to the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract, defence mechanisms must be capable of acting at that site to be effective. Therefore, the intraepithelial leukocyte (IEL) population of the intestinal mucosa was chosen for initial study. Treatment of intestinal samples with DTT and EDTA in calcium- and magnesium-free buffers allowed recovery of viable IEL populations appropriate for further functional assessment. Studies of IELs isolated from neonatal calves revealed that non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity of BCV-infected target cells was more prevalent in calves with concurrent virus infection, suggesting in vivo activation of the cytotoxic response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same calves did not mediate cytotoxicity, emphasizing the difference in function of lymphocytes isolated from different anatomical sites. IELs from normal adult animals rarely showed spontaneous non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. However, interleukin-2 (IL-2) was a potent activator of IEL cytotoxicity in vitro, enhancing the killing of BCV-infected target cells after just 18 h of treatment. Incubation of IELs with interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) did not induce cytotoxic activity, but TNF could augment the levels of IL-2-induced cytotoxicity. Although further analysis of the cytotoxic effector cells present in the intestinal epithelium is required, the present study indicates that the IEL population may play a role in enteric antiviral activity.","output":"Non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxicity of bovine coronavirus-infected target cells mediated by bovine intestinal intraepithelial leukocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown response to COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic activity.

These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2.

Overall, 5702 mother-newborn pairs were analysed. Of these, 198 mothers reported high levels of stress using the Psychological Stress Measure (nine-items version; PSM-9). Maternal psychological stress was assessed between the 24(th) and 28(th) week of gestation and analyses were performed jointly and independently as a function of neonatal sex (separate analyses for male and female infants). Newborns exposed to high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy (a score above 26 measured using the PSM-9 questionnaire, corresponding to >97.5(th) percentile) were compared to newborns of mothers who reported lower stress.

Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, \\"reaction-diffusion\\", spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection \\"heat-maps\\" show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters.

METHODS Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and preprint servers until 13th April 2021. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The random-effects model for the meta-analysis was utilized to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for all-cause mortality was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.29 -1.43, n=652) comparing methylprednisolone with the control, indicating no mortality benefits. A similar finding was noted with a sub-group analysis including four trials that used low-dose methylprednisolone.

In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, or tabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. While typical transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, their performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong learning have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. But striving to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: the goal of lifelong learning, whether biological or artificial, should be to improve performance on both past tasks (backward transfer) and future tasks (forward transfer) with any new data. Our key insight is that even though learners trained on other tasks often cannot make useful decisions on the current task (the two tasks may have non-overlapping classes, for example), they may have learned representations that are useful for this task. Thus, although ensembling decisions is not possible, ensembling representations can be beneficial whenever the distributions across tasks are sufficiently similar. Moreover, we can ensemble representations learned independently across tasks in quasilinear space and time. We therefore propose two algorithms: representation ensembles of (1) trees and (2) networks. Both algorithms demonstrate forward and backward transfer in a variety of simulated and real data scenarios, including tabular, image, and spoken, and adversarial tasks. This is in stark contrast to the reference algorithms we compared to, all of which failed to transfer either forward or backward, or both, despite that many of them require quadratic space or time complexity.","output":"Representation Ensembling for Synergistic Lifelong Learning with Quasilinear Complexity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the world's countries are in the grip of coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets contaminating surfaces and hands that then transmit the virus to another person's respiratory system Older people and those with cardiopulmonary co-morbidities or immunological deficiency will be more at risk of severe disease Human lifestyle is adversely affected Most of the people are afraid of visiting or welcoming people into their respective houses There is need of better sanitization of homes and keeping us safe from infection To tackle this problem, we thought a new smart system to handle the visitor's entry in houses or premise automatically This system consists of different devices coupled together to work with each other in order to provide utmost protection from infection It keeps track of people visiting, their condition while entering premise, safety gear equipment etc In this research paper we have briefly explained architecture, working and software implementation of this system ? 2021 IEEE","output":"COVID 19 Visitor Management System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

Materials and methods. A survey of 283 patients with mild and moderate severity was conducted. The survey showed a significant change in eating behavior in patients during the disease. To assess the effectiveness of nutritional support during the disease and during the recovery period, 36 individuals took a specialized product of dietary therapeutic and preventive nutrition Detoxifying Kissel LEOVIT DETOX daily after the diagnosis of COVID-19, both throughout the entire period of the disease, and within 2 weeks after the disease and going to work. Results and discussion. The survey showed the presence of a significant range of eating disorders in patients with coronavirus disease. It was found that in 90% of the respondents during the day, the main meal was 3 or more times. During the disease, the number of main meals decreased in 40% of individuals, and only in 4% of patients this figure increased. When using nutritional support with dietary therapeutic and prophylactic foods during the disease, patients noted a significant decrease in weakness and fatigue, temperature fluctuations, fears, anxiety, suspiciousness and other symptoms began to disappear.

Pygmy bluetongue lizards, Tiliqua adelaidensis, occupy individual territories, live exclusively in burrows constructed by spiders in Australian native grasslands and are hosts to a tick, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, and a nematode, Pharyngodon wandillahensis. 3. On five monthly occasions, the locations of all individual lizards in three study plots were used to construct weighted, undirected networks based on proximity of adjacent burrows. 4. The networks were used to explore alternative hypotheses about the spread of each parasite through the population: that stable population members that remained in the same burrow over the study period played a major role in influencing the pattern of infection or that dispersing individuals played a more significant role. 5. For ticks, host individuals that were infected were more connected in the network than uninfected hosts and this relationship remained significant for connections to residents in the population, but not for connections to dispersers. 6. For nematodes, infected and uninfected hosts did not differ in their overall strength of connection in the network, but infected hosts were more connected to dispersers than were uninfected hosts, suggesting that lizards moving across the population are the major agents for the transmission of nematodes. 7.

Currently, no FDA approved drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of LASV fever. The LASV glycoprotein complex (GP) is a promising target for vaccine or drug development. It is situated on the virion envelope and plays key roles in LASV growth, cell tropism, host range, and pathogenicity. In an effort to discover new LASV vaccines, we employ several sequence-based computational prediction tools to identify LASV GP major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II T-cell epitopes. In addition, many sequence- and structure-based computational prediction tools were used to identify LASV GP B-cell epitopes. The predicted T- and B-cell epitopes were further filtered based on the consensus approach that resulted in the identification of thirty new epitopes that have not been previously tested experimentally. Epitope-allele complexes were obtained for selected strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes using molecular docking and the complexes were relaxed with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes. These predictions provide guidance to the experimental investigations and validation of the epitopes with the potential for stimulating T-cell responses and B-cell antibodies against LASV and allow the design and development of LASV vaccines.","output":"In-silico identification of the vaccine candidate epitopes against the Lassa virus hemorrhagic fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected African countries, specifically the countries, such as Libya, that are in constant conflict. Clinical and laboratory information, including mortality and associated risk factors in relation to hospital settings and available resources, about critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Africa is not available. This study aimed to determine the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) following 60 days after ICU admission, and explore the factors that influence in\\\\ICU mortality rate. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study among COVID-19 critical care patients in 11 ICUs in Libya from May 29th to December 30th 2020. Basic demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory values, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, quick SOFA, and clinical management were analyzed. RESULT: We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5C75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4C10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3C10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1C31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1C2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4C7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission. Several factors were found to be predictive of mortality, which may help to identify patients at risk of mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Epidemiology, outcomes, and utilization of intensive care unit resources for critically ill COVID-19 patients in Libya: A prospective multi-center cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to identify existing policies related to social protection of healthcare workers during the spread of a pandemic.

Understanding host immune control efficacy and how different factors influence lung injury and disease severity are critical. We established and validated dynamical connections between viral loads, infected cells, CD8(+) T cells, lung injury, inflammation, and disease severity using an integrative mathematical model-experiment exchange. Our results showed that the dynamics of inflammation and virus-inflicted lung injury are distinct and nonlinearly related to disease severity, and that these two pathologic measurements can be independently predicted using the model-derived infected cell dynamics. Our findings further indicated that the relative CD8(+) T cell dynamics paralleled the percent of the lung that had resolved with the rate of CD8(+) T cell-mediated clearance rapidly accelerating by over 48,000 times in 2 days. This complimented our analyses showing a negative correlation between the efficacy of innate and adaptive immune-mediated infected cell clearance, and that infection duration was driven by CD8(+) T cell magnitude rather than efficacy and could be significantly prolonged if the ratio of CD8(+) T cells to infected cells was sufficiently low.

Proportionate mortality rates (PMR) were compared across race/ethnicity and by ethnicity/nativity. RESULTS: We identified 10,200 COVID-19 deaths in CA occurring February 1 through July 31, 2020. The most frequently observed characteristics among decedents were age 65 years or above, male, Hispanic, foreign-born, and educational attainment of High School or below. MRR indicated elevated COVID-19 morality rates among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic groups compared with the White group, with Black and Hispanic groups having the highest MRR at 2.75 (95%CI: 2.54-2.97) and 4.18 (95%CI: 3.99-4.37), respectively. Disparities were larger at younger ages. Similar results were observed with PMR, and patterns of age-racial/ethnic disparities remained in analyses stratified by education. Elevated PMR were observed in all ethnicity/nativity groups, especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals, relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals.

The first step to design effective interventions aiming to decrease sedentary lifestyle is to explore the factors associated with sedentary lifestyle. AIM: Our aims were to describe the type and duration of sitting activities and to examine the factors associated with sedentary lifestyle, namely 1) sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, gender, education level, marital status); 2) medical factors (chronic diseases, use of walking aids); 3) lifestyle factors (i.e., duration of institutionalization, smoking status) among older people living in nursing homes providing long-term care. METHOD: Data collected with questionnaire from 248 participants were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 159 participants (64.1%) in total who were characterized by sedentary lifestyle. In our sample, the sedentary lifestyle was associated with the smoking status, the number of age-related chronic diseases, the duration of institutionalization, and the use of walking aids. CONCLUSION: The older people who have more chronic diseases, who are smokers and were institutionalized earlier are more likely to be characterised by sedentary lifestyle.

Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality; however, relatively few studies have examined the occurrence of multiple obesity\\\\related outcomes in the same patient population. This study was designed to examine the associations between body mass index (BMI) and a broad range of obesity\\\\related conditions in the same large cohort from a UK\\\\representative primary care database. METHODS: Demographic data and diagnosis codes were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in January 2019. Adults registered for  3 years were grouped by BMI, with BMI 18.5C24.9 kg/m(2) as reference group. Associations between BMI and 12 obesity\\\\related outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. RESULTS: More than 2.9 million individuals were included in the analyses and were followed up for occurrence of relevant outcomes for a median of 11.4 years during the study period. Generally, there was a stepwise increase in risk of all outcomes with higher BMI.

The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term safety of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine in patients with high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer after local resection. METHODS This single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial included patients undergoing local resection for high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer within 12 weeks prior to enrollment. High-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer was defined as the presence of at least one of the following factors: poor differentiation of adenocarcinoma, submucosal invasion depth > 1 mm, presence of lymphovascular invasion and grade-2 or -3 tumour budding. Protocol treatment comprised 45.0 Gy radiotherapy with conventional fractionation and 1650 mg/m2 capecitabine given twice daily until radiotherapy completion. The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate with an expected rate of 95% and a threshold of 80%. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients from six institutions were enrolled between May 2015 and February 2018. One patient was ineligible. Twenty-three patients completed treatment, with a completion rate of 82% (80% confidence interval, 69-91%); the remaining five patients completed treatment with protocol deviation. The median relative dose intensity of capecitabine was 100% (range, 58-100%). Common adverse events included radiation dermatitis (54%), anal pain (39%) and anal mucositis (29%). No grade-3 or higher adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy using capecitabine demonstrated acceptable short-term safety profiles in patients with high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer after local resection.","output":"Short-term safety of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after local resection for patients with high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer: a single-arm, multicenter phase II trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute acetaminophen (ACT) ingestion has been reported to reduce thermal strain during cycling in the heat.

Epidemiological data are crucial for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, designing studies, and optimizing resource distribution. The goal of this review is to present general aspects of mortality data published over the past decades. A systematic search of the MEDLINE/PubMed was performed. The articles were divided according to their methodology, type of reported mortality, and time. The main outcome was mortality. Extracted data included study duration, number of patients, and number of centers. The mortality trends and current mortality were calculated for subgroups consisting of in-hospital, ICU, 28/30-d, and 60-d mortality over 3 time periods (A, before 1995; B, 1995-2000; C, after 2000). The retrospectivity and prospectivity were also taken into account. Moreover, we present the most recent mortality rates since 2010. One hundred seventy-seven articles were included in the final analysis. General mortality rates ranged from 11 to 87% in studies including subjects with ARDS of all etiologies (mixed group). Linear regression revealed that the study design (28/30-d or 60-d) significantly influenced the mortality rate. Reported mortality rates were higher in prospective studies, such as randomized controlled trials and prospective observational studies compared with retrospective observational studies. Mortality rates exhibited a linear decrease in relation to time period (P < .001). The number of centers showed a significant negative correlation with mortality rates. The prospective observational studies did not have consistently higher mortality rates compared with randomized controlled trials. The mortality trends over 3 time periods (before 1995, 1995-2000, and after 2000) yielded variable results in general ARDS populations. However, a mortality decrease was present mostly in prospective studies. Since 2010, the overall rates of in-hospital, ICU, and 28/30-d and 60-d mortality were 45, 38, 30, and 32%, respectively.","output":"Past and Present ARDS Mortality Rates: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional intelligence or EI is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of the people around you.

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), which is composed of major PGs. Similar to keratin sulfate (KS), another GAG, CS inhibits axon regeneration. However, the influence of these GAGs on the pathogenicity of neuroimmunological diseases is unclear. Here, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice lacking CS N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-1 (CSGalNAcT1-KO), an important enzyme for CS synthesis. In our study, CSGalNAcT1-KO mice showed milder EAE symptoms than those in wild-type (WT) mice. The recall response of antigen-specific lymphocytes showed that CSGalNAcT1-KO-derived lymphocytes had a milder cell proliferation response than that in WT-derived lymphocytes. These results suggest that CS contributes toward the induction phase of EAE. We previously performed EAE experiments in GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase KO (GlcNAc6ST-KO) and C6ST1-KO mice, which had reduced KS and reduced CS-C, respectively. EAE in CSGalNAcT1-KO mice was more similar to that in GlcNAc6ST-KO mice than in C6ST1-KO mice. In conclusion, the distinct GAG sugar chains are associated with severe or mild phenotypes of EAE and are therefore potential new therapeutic targets for neuroimmunological diseases, including multiple sclerosis.","output":"Chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosyltransferase-1 knockout shows milder phenotype in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis than in wild type."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need.

Confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China were retrospectively included between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. Demographic information, epidemiologic data, clinical features and treatment data were extracted from medical records. Seven COVID-19 patients with chronic HBV infection were included. Six (85.7%) patients were male. The patients aged from 33 years to 49 years. Two patients had HBV-related cirrhosis. One patients (14.3%) were positive for serum hepatitis B virus e antigen. On admission, 1 (14.3%) patients had mildly elevated ALT level (>40 U/L) and 1 (14.3%) had elevated AST level (>40 U/L).

Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells. Specimens were drilled for 1-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope. A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent). Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60acm in radius. RESULTS: Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site. Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate. Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30acm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, pa=a0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol-generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment. A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.","output":"Demonstration and Mitigation of Aerosol and Particle Dispersion During Mastoidectomy Relevant to the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To review the dynamics of neuroscience research in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from 2013-2018.

The study was conducted online, during the general lockdown in the country, and 358 individuals (239 females) participated (mean age = 36.89; SD = 12.15). A perception of personal control over the condition, negative emotions towards the pandemic, and self-efficacy to cope with the current anti-pandemic measures were related to psychological distress. Also, a significant interaction between representation clusters and self-efficacy to cope with potential future difficulties (i.e., after the anti-pandemic measures are ended), was found. Specifically, the association between this type of self-efficacy and psychological distress was significant only for the 'low-impact' representations cluster (i.e., a perception of the pandemic as less burdensome and more controllable). The findings indicate that the factors which, according to previous research and theory, are significantly related to psychological distress during a health threat, are important also in times of a pandemic. They also suggest a potential adaptation-promoting synergy between pandemic-related self-efficacy and a more positive representation of COVID-19, as far as psychological distress is conerned.

RECENT FINDINGS There are limited published data on prone positioning in respiratory failure because of COVID-19. The use of proning in nonintubated patients with COVID-19 may improve oxygenation and dyspnea but has not been associated with improved outcomes. Initial adult cohort studies of intubated patients undergoing prone positioning in severe ARDS related to COVID-19 have shown an improvement in mortality. Although the use of proning in children with severe COVID-19 is recommended, data supporting its use is scarce.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a great risk to those with hematological malignancies who are at higher risk of severe disease and death than the general population. Previous studies looking at the immune response to influenza vaccination in those with MDS had shown promising results, with immune responses not differing from those of healthy family members. Whilst some data exist to reassure the MDS community that majority of patients show seroconversion following Covid-19 vaccination, little data exists on their neutralizing capacity or post vaccination T-cell responses in this cohort. In addition, the majority of patients in these studies received BNT162b2 and there is little published data on vaccine response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We have investigated the humoral and T-cell response of 39 patients with MDS two to four weeks following Covid-19 booster vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 through the SOAP study (Sars-cov-2 fOr cAncer Patients, IRAS project ID:282337). Plasma and PBMCs from MDS cases and healthy controls have been collected, and are being assessed for both humoral and cellular responses to SARS_CoV_2, the alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants. Humoral responses will be assessed using ELISA (peptide binding) and functional viral neutralization assays. Cellular responses will be assessed using IFNy ELISPOT and flow cytometry (CD25 and CD69 expression) after 24h peptide stimulation. All data at time point 1 (2 - 4 weeks following booster vaccination) have been collected and will subsequently be collected at 6 months and 12 months post-vaccination. We also report on the safety data for these vaccines within this patient population. Of this cohort 64% were male with a median age of 65 years (range 21-84). 54% received vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 44% received BNT162b2 (2% unrecorded). The vaccines were well tolerated with no serious adverse events to date. The mean interval between doses was 70.7 days (range 50 - 90 days). 71% of the cohort were receiving no disease modifying therapy at the time of vaccination, half of whom were receiving supportive therapy and the other half no intervention for their MDS. Of those receiving disease modifying therapy; 5 were receiving azacitidine, (1 in conjunction with low-dose cytarabine) and 3 ciclosporin. We will report the largest study of the humoral and T-cell mediated response to the Covid-19 vaccine in MDS patients to date. This will include cellular response to the delta variant and immunogenicity of both the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. Given the vulnerability of these patients to severe disease, investigating the immune response to the vaccines begins to build an evidence base for advising MDS patients on their ongoing risk of infection during the pandemic and going forward. The SOAP study will reassess the immune response at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination to continue to investigate post-vaccine immunity in this cohort. Disclosures Kulasekararaj: F.

This study was designed to explore the prediction value of the frailty index (FI) for postoperative morbidity in older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, we conducted a prospective study in our hospital, and patients aged over 65 years were enrolled. The FI assessment was conducted by two specialist nurses based on the 38-item scale, and patients were considered frail if the FI score was  0.25. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative morbidity. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to find the risk factors related to postoperative morbidity. RESULTS: A total of 246 consecutive patients were enrolled, for whom the median age was 72.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 67.0C77.0] years old, and 175 (71.1%) were male. Of these, 47 (19.1%) were frail. Patients with frailty were associated with older age (p < 0.001), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade (p = 0.006), lower body mass index (p = 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.003) and haemoglobin (p < 0.001) levels, increased blood loss (p = 0.034), increased risk of postoperative morbidity (p < 0.001), increased median length of stay (p = 0.017), and increased median postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.003). Multivariable analysis revealed that ASA grade [odds ratio (OR): 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19C5.64, p = 0.016], FI score (OR 7.68, 95% CI 3.19C18.48, p < 0.001) and surgical complexity (OR 22.83, 95% CI 5.46C95.51, p < 0.001) were independent predictors of 30-day postoperative morbidity. However, for patients with major surgery, FI score was the only independent predictor (OR 8.67, 95% CI 3.23C23.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, and the 38-item FI scale was a useful frailty screening tool for older patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. For patients with major surgery, frailty was a more reliable predictor of postoperative 30-day morbidity than age and ASA grade.

METHODS: Review of the literature related to acceptable delays for treatment of common orthopaedic conditions, experience of healthcare professionals from low resource communities and expertise of experienced surgeons. RESULTS: Guidelines for the management of cancellations of elective surgeries during a period of resource reallocation are proposed. Elective cases must not be postponed indefinitely as adverse outcomes may result. Triage of waiting lists should include continuous monitoring of the patient and close communication with families despite social distancing and travel restrictions. Telehealth becomes a necessity. Common orthopaedic conditions are triaged into four groups according to urgency and safe and acceptable delay. Categories proposed are Emergent (life and limb threatening conditions), Urgent (within seven days), Semi-elective (postponed for three months) and Elective (postponed for three to 12 months). In total, 25 common orthopaedic conditions are reviewed and categorized. CONCLUSION: Given the uncertainty within healthcare during a pandemic, it is necessary to determine acceptable delays for elective conditions. We report our experience in developing guidelines and propose categorizing elective cases into four categories, based on the length of delay. Telemedicine plays a key role in determining the gravity of each situation and hence the amount of delay. These guidelines will assist others dealing with elective cases in the midst of a crisis.

METHODS: Pediatric patients with symptoms of URI had nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples obtained prospectively between January and April and September and December 2010 for small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) multiplex nucleic acid testing. NP swabs or nasal washes were obtained for viral culture and rapid antigen testing (RAT). RESULTS: Of 499 evaluable SVPCR array RP samples, 344 (69%) tested positive for at least 1 of the 21 tested organisms. The most commonly identified pathogen was rhinovirus/enterovirus (181/344 [53%]) for which no RAT exists at CHM. Of 344 positive specimens, 57 (17%) had at least 2 identified pathogens; 8 (2%) of these had 3. In 11% of patients, molecular testing detected pathogens or pathogen combinations requiring both contact and droplet precautions. CONCLUSION: SVPCR array RP testing detected respiratory pathogens in pediatric patients with URI at rates higher than that of RAT and viral culture. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected, the study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions may be warranted to prevent health care-associated infection in pediatric inpatients with URI.

The alarming speed at which SARS-CoV-2 has spread, and the high mortality rate of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has required both basic science and clinical research to move at an unprecedented pace. Models previously developed to study the immune response against SARS-CoV have been rapidly deployed to now study SARS-CoV-2. To date, both small and large animal models are remarkably consistent when infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, certain models have proven more useful when answering specific immunological questions than others. Small animal models, such as Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice carrying the hACE2 transgene, appear to reliably recapitulate the initial cytokine surge seen in COVID-19 as well as show significant innate and adaptive cell infiltration in to the lung early in infection. Additionally, these models develop strong antibody responses to the virus, are protected from reinfection, and genetically modified versions exist that can be used to ask specific immunological questions. Large animal models such as rhesus and cynomologus macaques and African green monkeys are critical to understanding how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection because they are considered to be the most similar to humans. These models are considered the gold standard for assessing vaccine efficacy and protection, and recapitulate the initial cytokine surge, immune cell infiltration into the lung, certain aspects of thrombosis, and the antibody and T-cell response to the virus.

EXPOSURES: Self-reported ethnicity and primary language. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) utilization and in-hospital death. We used age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and multivariable analysis to evaluate the associations between ethnicity/language groups and outcomes. RESULTS: 32.1% of patients were Hispanic, 38.6% of whom reported a non-English primary language. Hispanic patients were less likely to be insured, have a primary care provider, and have accessed the healthcare system prior to the COVID-19 admission. After adjusting for age, Hispanic inpatients experienced higher ICU utilization (non-English-speaking: OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.47-2.08; English-speaking: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95-1.33) and higher mortality (non-English-speaking: OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.10-1.86; English-speaking: OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.98) compared to non-Hispanic inpatients.

Case report: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient's HScore [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. Results: The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24a?h. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48a?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11a?days feeling fit and well.

We then assume this estimated cumulated prevalence to be the actual cumulated prevalence of SARS-COV-2 across all age bands in Germany during the first COVID-19 wave. From there we calculate the age dependent infection fatality rates. We distinguish between the individuals with life expectancy below 20 weeks and those above 20 weeks.Results: For the first COVID-19 wave, we find a cumulated prevalence of about 3% for Germany across all age bands.The steep age gradient of the IFR is significantly smaller by a factor of around 10 when considering healthy individuals only, as compared to the IFR calculated for all individuals in the respective age bands. For the 90+ age band we find an overall IFR of 7.0% while for healthy 90+ individuals, the IFR reduces to 0.50%. For the 80-90 age band the IFRs are 2.2% and 0.74% respectively, for the 60-80 age band 0.40% and 0.025%, for the 40-60 age band 0.071% and 0.023%, and finally for the 0-40 age band 0.0014% and <0.00085%. The overall IFR for the total population is 0.35% and for healthy individuals 0.074%. The IFR for individuals in the 90+ age band with life expectancy smaller than 2 weeks is assumed to be close to 1.The results for overall IFR are in agreement with previous seroprevalence studies, supporting the here presented approach. Conclusion: We conclude that around 2.5 million individuals in Germany were infected during the first COVID-19 wave, whereas less than 10% of infected individuals were detected via tests. In addition to the known fact that the infection fatality rate depends significantly on the age of the infected individual, we furthermore show that a second major factor is the life expectancy of the individual under mild (COVID-19-free) conditions. This second factor has not been paid much quantitative attention to so far. We find that a large fraction of deaths due to COVID-19 actually stem from such weak individuals, i.e. people who pre-died in the first COVID-19 wave and would have died without COVID-19 only a few weeks later (harvesting effect, well-known for COVID-19 from other studies).","output":"Inferring the Prevalence and Age Dependence of Infection Fatality Rate from Excess Mortalities for COVID-19 in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In response to COVID-19, dental educators have been tasked with maintaining the quality of education while reducing cost, increasing efficiency, and leveraging technology.

Contaminants in the air can deteriorate indoor air quality and negatively affect the health of infants and toddlers in daycare centers. Also, with the COVID-19 spread, the outbreak of infectious diseases in daycare centers is another airborne threat to young children. In closed spaces, air contaminants such as PM10 can be used as potential containers to transmit indoor infectious matters. Since young children have immature immunity, indoor air contaminant controls are significant to support a healthy indoor air environment. Accordingly, the government of Korea has enhanced indoor air quality control regulations and recommendations, but on-site evaluation of daycare centers is still not sufficient to provide systematic knowledge of the indoor air contaminants. Therefore, this study monitored a daycare center in the metropolitan area and then diagnosed the occurrence and correlations of indoor air contaminants. The results of this study verified that many hours still exceeded the maximum air quality criteria in the daycare center, which were mostly found during the daytime. Also, correlations between indoor air contaminants were varying depending on outdoor air conditions.

This study examined the determinants of the timing to implement an intervention. Through an impact analysis, the study explored the effects of the interventions and the potential risks of removing them under the context of reopening the economy. Method A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis. Findings To our knowledge, we provided in this article the first explicit analysis of the timing, determinants, and impacts of mitigation interventions for all states and Washington DC in the United States during the first five weeks of the pandemic. Unlike other studies that evaluate the Stay-at-Home order by using simulated data, the current study employed the real data of various case counts of Covid-19. The study obtained two meritorious findings: (1) states with a higher prevalence of Covid-19 cases per 10,000 population reacted more slowly to the outbreak, suggesting that some states may have missed the optimal timing to prevent the wide spread of the Covid-19 disease; and (2) of nine mitigation measures, three (non-essential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states. Interpretation The opposite direction of the prevalence rate on the timing of issuing the mitigation interventions partially explains why the Covid-19 caseload in the U.S. remains high. A swift implementation of social distancing is crucial-the key is not whether such measures should be taken but when. Because there is no preventive vaccine and because there are few potentially effective treatments, recent reductions in new cases and deaths must be due, in large part, to the social interventions delivered by states. The study suggests that the policy of reopening economy needs to be implemented carefully.","output":"Social Distancing Interventions in the United States: An Exploratory Investigation of Determinants and Impacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The concept of the model minority myth (MMM), a stereotype that Asian Americans have more academic success and social mobility compared to other people of color, has been a prominent point of discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increase in discrimination against Asian Americans (even children). This literature review aims to pinpoint the positive and negative impacts of the stereotype on Asian American development, then expands the discussion to include how COVID-19 may change this dialogue. Methods: A PubMed search for the phrase model minority was conducted, searching for studies from 2001 to 2021 investigating how the MMM affects Asian development and health. These studies were then categorized by the age group of the participants and the themes of the paper. Results: The PubMed search returned 71 results, 28 of which were excluded due to not discussing the MMM (18) or not being a study (10). The eligible studies largely fell into 2 categories: 1) the integration of the MMM into personal identity (12);and 2) mental healthcare disparities due to the MMM (25). The former category described positive effects of the MMM like a greater drive to academically succeed, although they were outweighed by multiple negative factors including decreased help-seeking behavior, pressure to meet lofty expectations, and increased anti-Black attitudes. The majority of the latter category stated how the MMM directly contributed to the underutilization of mental health services given sociocultural expectations across all age groups. Conclusions: These data highlight how the MMM can both worsen the mental health of Asian American youth while discouraging the pursuit of treatment. Asian American youth are especially at risk for the negative consequences of the stereotype given their dependence on family. That said, the recent press regarding anti-Asian racism during the pandemic may impact how the MMM is discussed in the future, questioning its validity.

Although patients with hematological malignancy (HM) are reported to have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with those with solid cancer, the effects of treatment for HM on COVID-19 severity have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the risk factors, including number and timing of chemotherapeutic regimens for HM, for COVID-19 severity in 17 patients with HM, who had developed nosocomial COVID-19 in our department, by dividing them into two groups; a severe group (N=7) and a non-severe group (N=10). RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 47%, and mortality in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group (odds ratio [OR], 18.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1223.17, P=0.02).

However, a history of chemotherapy for HM within 3 months prior to the onset of COVID-19 was not a significant risk factor (P=0.54).

Even though patients disease condition is improving following conventional therapies, researchers are studying alternative tools that can penetrate solid tumours to deliver the therapeutics due to issues of developing resistance by the cancer cells. Treating cancer is not the only the goal in cancer therapy; it also includes protecting non-cancerous cells from the toxic effects of anti-cancer agents. Thus, various advanced techniques, such as cell-based drug delivery, bacteria-mediated therapy, and nanoparticles, are devised for site-specific delivery of drugs. One of the novel methods that can be targeted to deliver anti-cancer agents is by utilising genetically modified non-pathogenic bacterial species. This is due to the ability of bacterial species to multiply selectively or non-selectively on tumour cells, resulting in biofilms that leads to disruption of metastasis process. In preclinical studies, this technology has shown significant results in terms of efficacy, and some are currently under investigation. Therefore, researchers have conducted studies on bacteria transporting the anti-cancer drug to targeted tumours. Alternatively, bacterial ghosts and bacterial spores are utilised to deliver anti-cancer drugs. Although in vivo studies of bacteria-mediated cancer therapy have shown successful outcome, further research on bacteria, specifically their targeting mechanism, is required to establish a complete clinical approach in cancer treatment. This review has focused on the up-to-date understanding of bacteria as a therapeutic carrier in the treatment of cancer as an emerging field.

In contrast, BCG stimulates long-term tumor-specific immunity that primarily depends on CD4 T cells. We demonstrate that BCG therapy results in enhanced effector function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, mainly through enhanced production of IFN-. Accordingly, BCG-induced tumor elimination and tumor-specific immune memory require tumor cell expression of the IFN- receptor, but not MHC class II.

As a natural landscape in the city, urban waterfront space has efficient ecological benefits, high-quality landscape vision and environment, and it is an important carrier of citizens activities. However, existing studies have mainly focused on coping with environmental problems, while social functions and strategies have been neglected. Therefore, this study aims to fill such research gaps by understanding the social performance of urban waterfront spaces. Field observation and questionnaire survey were conducted in a famous urban waterfront space, Qiantang riverside walkway, in Hangzhou, China. The results indicate that the Qiantang riverside walkway serves as a space for tourism, leisure and entertainment, as the visitors who lived more than 5 km away from here accounted for about 50% and the local people also accounted for about 50%. Peoples activities exhibited significantly temporal differences, where the occupation of the Qiantang riverside walkway reached a peak at night. For the people who lived far from here, they mainly depended on self-driving, which led to two critical problems relevant to transport linkage with the city and parking lot. Results also indicate that the landscape, supporting facilities and road functions could perform well among the mind of 102 respondents. However, public service and main facilities should be improved to meet more peoples requirements. Moreover, importantly, the results indicate the phenomenon of stratification and agglomeration so that the similar aspects (e.g. rest seat quantity, rest seat style) could be merged into the same cluster (e.g. rest seat) for consideration in the urban waterfront space planning and design.

The lack of animal models that reproduce human-like lung disease, associated with the necrotic lung pathology, impairs studies of M. kansasii virulence and pathogenicity. In this study, we examined the ability of the C57BL/6 mice, intratracheally infected with highly virulent M. kansasii strains, to produce a chronic infection and necrotic lung pathology. As a first approach, we evaluated ten M. kansasii strains isolated from Brazilian patients with pulmonary disease and the reference strain M. kansasii ATCC 12478 for virulence-associated features in macrophages infected in vitro; five of these strains differing in virulence were selected for in vivo analysis. Highly virulent isolates induced progressive lung disease in mice, forming large encapsulated caseous granulomas in later stages (120C150 days post-infection), while the low-virulent strain was cleared from the lungs by day 40. Two strains demonstrated increased virulence, causing premature death in the infected animals. These data demonstrate that C57BL/6 mice are an excellent candidate to investigate the virulence of M. kansasii isolates. We observed considerable heterogeneity in the virulence profile of these strains, in which the presence of highly virulent strains allowed us to establish a clinically relevant animal model. Comparing public genomic data between Brazilian isolates and isolates from other geographic regions worldwide demonstrated that at least some of the highly pathogenic strains isolated in Brazil display remarkable genomic similarities with the ATCC strain 12478 isolated in the United States 70 years ago (less than 100 SNPs of difference), as well as with some recent European clinical isolates.

Furthermore, we studied the association between COVID-19-status and treatment times. METHODS: We included all patients receiving reperfusion treatment in 17 Dutch stroke centers from May 11th, 2017, until May 11th, 2020. We collected baseline characteristics, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, onset-to-door time (ODT), door-to-needle time (DNT), door-to-groin time (DGT) and COVID-19-status at admission. Parameters during the lockdown (March 15th, 2020 until May 11th, 2020) were compared with those in the same period in 2019, and between groups stratified by COVID-19-status. We used nationwide data and extrapolated our findings to the increasing trend of EVT numbers since May 2017. RESULTS: A decline of 14% was seen in reperfusion treatments during lockdown, with a decline in both IVT and EVT delivery. DGT increased by 12 min (50 to 62 min, p-value of < 0.001). Furthermore, median NIHSS-scores were higher in COVID-19 - suspected or positive patients (7 to 11, p-value of 0.004), door-to-treatment times did not differ significantly when stratified for COVID-19-status.

Furthermore, conservative or surgical treatment is performed depending on the extent of cystic malformation, hepatic dysfunction and structural hepatic changes, but little is known about which treatment should be offered to patients with CD or CS and cancer. AIM: To further investigate the malignant transformation in these conditions.

RESULTS: Twelve retrospective studies reporting the courses of 561 patients (53% females) were included in this systematic review. With a mean age of 41.6 years old (range 23 to 56 years old), patients were younger than other populations undergoing liver surgery. Depending on the size of the study population the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varied from 2.7% to 37.5% with an overall incidence of 6.6%. There were only few detailed reports about preoperative diagnostic work-up, but a multimodal work-up including ultrasound of the liver, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used in most studies. Disease duration was variable with up to several years. Most patients had episodes of cholangitis, sepsis, fever or abdominal pain. Tumor detection was an incidental finding of the surgical specimen in most cases because it is currently often impossible to detect tumor manifestation during preoperative diagnostics. Liver resection or liver transplantation was performed depending on the extent of the biliary pathology and additional alterations of the liver structure or function. No postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was reported, but chemotherapy was administered in selected cases of tumor recurrence. Overall survival rates after one year were low at 36% and a high recurrence rate of up to 75% during the observation period. CONCLUSION: Only few retrospective studies reported a low tumor incidence.

Peak virus loads were similar in all groups, but the resolution of virus in the T cell-depleted animals was slightly delayed compared to controls. The T cell-depleted groups developed virus-neutralizing antibody responses and also class-switched to IgG.

Low percentages of DNAM-1-TIGIT+TACTILE+ NK cells and DNAM-1- TIGIT+TACTILE+ CD56- T cells were associated with a better survival of AML patients. Conclusions: The expression of DNAM-1 is reduced in NK cells and in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from AML patients compared with those from healthy volunteers. An increased percentage of NK and T cells lacking DNAM-1 and co-expressing TIGIT and TACTILE is associated with patient survival, supporting the role of TIGIT as a novel candidate for checkpoint blockade.","output":"Characterization of the DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE Axis on Circulating NK, NKT-Like and T Cell Subsets in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine metabolic disorders, affects the major organs in human and comorbid with others.

To combat this infections and comorbid situations, an integrated balanced nutritional supportive could help in maintaining sound health and increase immunity for prevention and management of such type of viral infections. OBJECTIVES: While information regarding nutritional supports in COVID-19 pandemic in diabetic patients are not available, this review aimed to accumulate the evidence from previous publications where studied about nutrition-based supports or interventions for viral diseases with special emphasis on respiratory infections. METHODS: For reviewing, searches are done for getting journal articles into Google Scholar, Pub Med/Medline, Database of Open Access Journal and Science Direct for relevant data and information. RESULTS: Integrated nutritional supports of both macronutrients and micronutrients guidelines including home-based physical exercise schedule is summarizes in this comprehensive review for possible prevention and management of diabetic patients in COVID-19 infections. The immune boosting benefits of some vitamins, trace elements, nutraceuticals and probiotics in viral infections of diabetic patients are also included.

METHODS: This is a phase 4 prospective study within a larger trial of two doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in 51 SSc patients compared with 153 controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed at each vaccine shot (D0/D28) and 6 weeks after the second dose(D69), only in individuals with negative baseline IgG/NAb and those who did not have coronavirus-19(COVID19) during follow-up. Vaccine safety was also assessed in all participants. RESULTS: Patients and controls had comparable median ages [48(38.5C57) vs 48(38C57) years, P =0.945]. Patients had mostly diffuse SSc (68.6%) and the majority (74.5%) had interstitial lung disease. Most patients were under immunosuppressive therapy (72.5%), mainly MMF (52.9%). After full vaccination (D69), anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG frequency (64.1% vs 94.2%, P < 0.001) and NAb positivity (53.8% vs 76.9%; P =0.006) were moderate, although lower than controls. The first dose response (D28) was low and comparable for both seroconvertion rates (SC) (P =0.958) and NAb positivity (P =0.537). SSc patients under MMF monotherapy vs other (no therapy/other DMARDs) had lower immunogenicity (SC: 31.3% vs 90%, P < 0.001) and NAb(18.8% vs 85%, P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that MMF use, but not disease subtype, is associated with insufficient seroconversion [odds ratio (OR)=0.056(95% CI: 0.009, 0.034), P =0.002] and NAb positivity [OR = 0.047(95% CI: 0.007, 0.036), P =0.002]. No moderate/severe side-effects were observed. CONCLUSION: CoronaVac has an excellent safety profile and moderate response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in SSc. Vaccine antibody response is not influenced by disease subtype and is greatly affected by MMF, reinforcing the need for additional strategies to up-modulate vaccine response in this subgroup of patients.

The feasibility and safety of surfactant delivery in COVID-19 ARDS patients have not been established. METHODS: We performed retrospective analyses of data from patients receiving off-label use of exogenous natural surfactant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven COVID-19 PCR positive ARDS patients received liquid Curosurf (720 mg) in 150 ml normal saline, divided into five 30 ml aliquots) and delivered via a bronchoscope into second-generation bronchi. Patients were matched with 14 comparable subjects receiving supportive care for ARDS during the same time period. Feasibility and safety were examined as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: Patients showed no evidence of acute decompensation following surfactant installation into minor bronchi. Cox regression showed a reduction of 28-days mortality within the surfactant group, though not significant. The surfactant did not increase the duration of ventilation, and health care providers did not convert to COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactant delivery through bronchoscopy at a dose of 720 mg in 150 ml normal saline is feasible and safe for COVID-19 ARDS patients and health care providers during the pandemic. Surfactant administration did not cause acute decompensation, may reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation duration in COVID-19 ARDS patients.

Patients with CPFE have higher mortality compared with patients who have COPD alone, but results have been inconclusive compared with patients who have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Poor prognostic factors for CPFE include exacerbation, lung cancer, and pulmonary hypertension. The presence of interstitial lung abnormalities, which may be an early or mild form of ILD, is notable among patients with COPD, and is associated with poor prognosis. Various theories have been proposed regarding the pathophysiology of CPFE. Biomarker analyses have implied that this pathophysiology may be more closely associated with IPF development, rather than COPD or emphysema. Patients with CPFE should be advised to quit smoking and undergo routine lung function tests, and pulmonary rehabilitation may be helpful.

P. falciparum merozoite Rh5 interacting protein (PfRipr) forms a complex with Rh5 and CyRPA in sequential molecular events leading to erythrocyte invasion. Recently we described PfRipr as a conserved protein that induces strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies in in vitro assays. However, being a large and complex protein of 1086 amino acids (aa) with 87 cysteine residues, PfRipr is difficult to express in conventional expression systems towards vaccine development. In this study we sought to identify the most potent region of PfRipr that could be developed to overcome difficulties related to protein expression, as well as to elucidate the invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies. Using the wheat germ cell-free system, Ecto- PfRipr and truncates of approximately 200 aa were expressed as soluble proteins. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfRipr truncate 5 (PfRipr_5: C(720)-D(934)), a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains, potently inhibit merozoite invasion. Furthermore, the antibodies strongly block PfRipr/Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its erythrocyte-surface receptor, SEMA7A.

However, information on kidney damage in older patients with COVID-19 is limited. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and associated with poor prognosis. We sought to explore the association between AKI and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study in a large tertiary care university hospital in Wuhan, China. All consecutive inpatients older than 65 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in this cohort. Demographic data, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between patients with AKI and without AKI. The association between AKI and mortality was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1764 in-hospital patients, 882 older adult cases were included in this cohort. The median age was 71 years (interquartile range: 68-77), 440 (49.9%) were men. The most presented comorbidity was cardiovascular diseases (58.2%), followed by diabetes (31.4%). Of 882 older patients, 115 (13%) developed AKI and 128 (14.5%) died. Patients with AKI had higher mortality than those without AKI (68 [59.1%] vs 60 [7.8%]; pa? <a? .001).

Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures. Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic. Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters.

Under controlled test conditions, the quantity of drug collected varied depending on the choice of head model. Head models vary depending on a combination of structural design differences, facial features (size and structure), internal volume measurements and airway geometries and these variations result in the differences in aerosol delivery. Of the widely available head models used in this study, only three were seen to closely predict in vivo aerosol delivery performance in adults compared with published scintigraphy data. Further, this testing identified the limited utility of some head models under certain test conditions, for example, the range reported across head models was aerosol drug delivery of 2.62  2.86% to 37.79  1.55% when used with a facemask.

Here, we present a high-throughput epitope identification system that combines capture of T cell-secreted cytokines by barcoded antigen-presenting cells (APCs), cell sorting, and next-generation sequencing to identify class I- and class II-restricted epitopes starting from highly complex peptide-encoding oligonucleotide pools. We engineered APCs to express anti-cytokine antibodies, a library of DNA-encoded peptides, and multiple HLA class I or II molecules. We demonstrate that these engineered APCs link T cell activation-dependent cytokines with the DNA that encodes the presented peptide. We validated this technology by showing that we could select known targets of viral epitope-, neoepitope-, and autoimmune epitope-specific TCRs, starting from mixtures of peptide-encoding oligonucleotides. Then, starting from 10 TCR sequences that are found commonly in humans but lack known targets, we identified seven CD8+ or CD4+ TCR-targeted epitopes encoded by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) genome.

We hypothesized that (1) sociodemographic factors and resiliency factors would partially explain psychological distress and anger, with stronger resiliency associated with lower levels of distress and anger; (2) women would report more trust in national leadership, as well as more psychological problems; (3) individuals of low socioeconomic status would report less resiliency, less trust in national leadership, and greater distress than individuals of higher socioeconomic status; and (4) hope would mediate the relationships between the other resiliency factors and both anger and distress. AIM: To explore whether community resilience, hope, and trust in leaders were associated with lower levels of anger and emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this observational study, data were gathered in Israel during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, just before the Jewish New Year (mid-September 2020), as a second lockdown was announced. Data were gathered from 636 Israeli adults, who were recruited by the Midgam research panel. The participants filled out self-reported questionnaires including one on state anger, the Brief Symptom Inventory as a measure of mental-health problems (i.e., somatization, depression, and anxiety), and questionnaires about trust in the states leaders, community resilience (CCRAM), and hope as measures of coping resources and resiliency. t-tests were used to explore differences between men and women and between those of lower and higher socioeconomic status. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then used to examine whether and how the sociodemographic and resiliency variables explained state anger and psychological distress. A Sobel test was used to evaluate the possible effects of hope on community resilience and trust in leadership in the context of both distress and anger. RESULTS: Our results revealed differences between women and men in terms of anger and mental-health problems, but not in terms of coping resources. Women reported higher levels of both anger and mental-health problems. Participants of lower socioeconomic status reported more mental-health problems, more anger, and greater trust in the states leaders; whereas those of higher socioeconomic status reported greater hope. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the sociodemographic factors of gender, age, and socioeconomic status, as well as community resilience, trust in the states leaders, and hope explained mental health with a total of 19% of the variance and anger with a total of 33% of the variance. The Sobel tests showed that hope mediated the relationships between community resilience and mental health (z = 3.46, P < 0.001), community resilience and anger (z = 2.90, P < 0.01), and trust in leaders and anger (z = 3.26, P < 0.01), but did not affect the relationship between trust in leaders and mental health (z = 1.53, P > 0.05).

Timing the right treatment for the right phase of this disease is paramount, with correlations detected between the phase of the infection and the type of drug used to treat. The immune system activation following COVID-19 infection can further develop to a fulminant cytokine storm which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory phase, or the hyperinflammation phase, is a later stage when patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and kidney and other organ failure. In this stage, the virus is probably not necessary and all the damage is due to the immune system's cytokine storm. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agent administration is the major strategy in treating COVID-19 patients at this stage. On the other hand, immunodeficient patients who are treated with immunomodulator agents have attenuated immune systems that do not produce enough cytokines. Current data do not show an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients taking biologic therapies or targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to assess the effect of these medications, and whether they may actually be protective of the severe type of disease. Although medications for COVID-19 and for the cytokine storm are important, the main breakthrough in slowing down the pandemic was developing effective vaccines. These vaccines showed a dramatic result in reducing morbidity and mortality up to the Delta variant's spread. However, the emergence of the new variant, Omicron, influenced the successful results we had before. This variant is more contagious but less dangerous than Delta. The aim now is to develop vaccines based on the Omicron and Delta immunogens in the future for broad protection against different variants.","output":"The Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: The Strongest Link to Morbidity and Mortality in the Current Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The number of chemicals in our society and in our daily lives continues to increase. Accompanying this is an increasing risk of human exposure to and injury from hazardous substances. Performing regular, structured surveillance of chemical incidents allows a greater awareness of the types of chemical hazards causing injury and the frequency of their occurrence, as well as providing a better understanding of exposures. OBJECTIVE: The objective of performing event-based surveillance (EBS) and capturing chemical incidents is to use this information to increase the situational awareness of chemical incidents, improve the management of these incidents and to inform measures to protect public health. METHODS: This paper describes a method for EBS for chemical incidents, including the sources used, storing the gathered information and subsequent analysis of potential trends in the data. RESULTS: We describe trends in the type of incidents that have been detected, the chemicals involved in these incidents and the health effects caused, in different geographic regions of the world.

This study aims to discover the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female healthcare professionals (HCPs) treating COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. METHODS: Using an empirical phenomenological methodology, semi-structured telephone-based qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 female HCPs who were providing their expertise for COVID-19 patients in tertiary-level hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. Purposive sampling was used for recruitment. The interviews were conducted between 20 July and 20 August 2020. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: This study explored the psychosocial, emotional and professional challenges faced by female HCPs serving COVID-19 patients. Five themes were observed in the interviews: apprehension while treating COVID-19 patients; feelings towards COVID-19 patients; challenges as female HCPs and coping strategies; confidence in government, administration and self-reflection; and finally, future concerns and recommendations. Many of these themes have also been linked with cultural issues, making the results specific to Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, female frontline HCPs have faced immense psychosocial pressure, ranging from unsupportive family norms to an unwelcoming working environment and insensitive hospital administrations. Moreover, rumours among the general public, lack of proper training, missing incentives and improper system surveillance have increased the anxiety and stress among HCPs. Hence, legislators are advised to take appropriate actions countrywide in order to alleviate the still ongoing challenges and support female HCPs in their working environment.

Patients hospitalized within 24 hours of diagnosis were classified based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) or no HC as treatments. The primary outcomes were mortality and use of mechanical ventilation. Findings A total of 807 patients were evaluated. Compared to the no HC group, after propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.83; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.89; P=0.009) but not in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.80 to 2.15; P=0.28).

Materials and Methods: Thirty immature roots of 24 permanent lower first molars with apical lesions were randomly divided into two groups: group 1 (15 roots) treated with MTA apical plugs and group 2 (15 roots) treated with Biodentine apical plugs. Treatment radiological outcomes were assessed using the periapical index (PAI) scale after 6 and 12 months of treatment. The presence or absence of apical calcified barrier (ACB) was assessed after 12 months of treatment. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to compare the postoperative pain between the two groups after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment. PAI scores between the two groups were compared using the MannCWhitney U test, the presence or absence of the ACB was compared using the chi-square test, and the VAS scores were compared using the t-test. The statistical significance threshold was set at 0.05. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the PAI between the two groups at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. After 12 months, four cases in the Biodentine group showed ACB formation, whereas ACB was not found in any case treated with MTA. The VAS scores were statistically lower in the MTA group on the first day after treatment. Nevertheless, these scores were not statistically significantly different after 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment between the two groups.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was supported by the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS), Tehran, Iran. A total of 40 respiratory samples (five nasopharyngeal and 35 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) were obtained from IPF patients referred to IUMS hospitals between April 2015 and December 2016. Assays were performed using the CLART Pneumovir DNA array assay, which made it possible to detect five genera of respiratory viruses simultaneously.Results/Key findings. Altogether, 22 of the 40 participants were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, rhino, corona and influenza viruses were found in 2.5 % (1/40), 7.5 % (3/40), 10 % (4/40), 2.5 % (1/40) and 0% (0/40) of cases, respectively. CONCLUSION Determining a correlation between the viruses and IPF is not an easy task, and therefore, this will require more research.

However, the mechanism by which complement is activated in this disease remains incompletely understood. Herein we examined the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and complement by inoculating the virus in lepirudin-anticoagulated human blood. This caused progressive C5a production after 30 minutes and 24 hours, which was blocked entirely by inhibitors for factor B, C3, C5, and heparan sulfate. However, this phenomenon could not be replicated in cell-free plasma, highlighting the requirement for cell surface deposition of complement and interactions with heparan sulfate. Additional functional analysis revealed that complement-dependent granulocyte and monocyte activation was delayed. Indeed, C5aR1 internalisation and CD11b upregulation on these cells only occurred after 24 hours. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is a non-canonical complement activator that triggers the alternative pathway through interactions with heparan sulfate.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Triggers Complement Activation through Interactions with Heparan Sulfate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have the potential to cross species barriers. To learn the molecular intersections among the most common coronaviruses of domestic and close-contact animals, we analyzed representative coronavirus genera infecting mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, white-tailed deer, swine, ferret, mink, alpaca, Rhinolophus bat, dolphin, whale, chicken, duck and turkey hosts; reference or complete genome sequences were available for most of these coronavirus genera. Protein sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were built for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The host receptors and enzymes aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), sialic acid synthase (SAS), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), cathepsin L (and its analogs) and furin were also compared. RESULTS: Overall, the S, E, M, and N proteins segregated according to their viral genera (, , or ), but the S proteins of alphacoronaviruses lacked conservation of phylogeny. Interestingly, the unique polybasic furin cleavage motif found in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) but not in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) exists in several -coronaviruses and a few - or -coronaviruses. Receptors and enzymes retained host species-dependent relationships with one another. Among the hosts, critical ACE2 residues essential for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding were most conserved in white-tailed deer and cattle. CONCLUSION: The polybasic furin cleavage motif found in several - and other coronaviruses of animals points to the existence of an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, and it also offers a counternarrative to the theory of a laboratory-engineered virus. Generally, the S proteins of coronaviruses show crossovers of phylogenies indicative of recombination events. Additionally, the consistency in the segregation of viral proteins of the MERS-like coronavirus (NC_034440.1) from pipistrelle bat supports its classification as a -coronavirus. Finally, similarities in host enzymes and receptors did not always explain natural cross-infections. More studies are therefore needed to identify factors that determine the cross-species infectivity of coronaviruses.","output":"Molecular phylogeny of coronaviruses and host receptors among domestic and close-contact animals reveals subgenome-level conservation, crossover, and divergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health worker density and distribution is critical for a strong health system and therefore has been listed among 1 of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets.

PD-associated Syn (Syn(PD)) aggregates can act as proteinaceous nuclei (seeds) able of self-templated propagation. Since this is strikingly reminiscent to properties of proteinaceous infectious particles (prions), lessons learned from prion diseases suggest to test whether transferred Syn(PD) can propagate and induce neurological impairments or disease in a new host. Two studies that addressed this question provided divergent results. Intracerebral (i.c.) injection of Lewy body extracts from PD patients caused cerebral Syn pathology, as well as nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, of wild-type mice and macaques, with the mice also showing motor impairments (Recasens et al. 2014, Ann Neurol 75:351C362). In contrast, i.c. transmission of homogenates from PD brains did not stimulate, after > 360 days post-injection (dpi), pathological Syn conversion or clinical symptoms in transgenic TgM83(+/?) mice hemizygously expressing mutated (A53T) human Syn (Prusiner et al. 2015, PNAS 112:E5308CE5317). To advance the assessment of possible Syn(PD) hazards by providing further data, we examined neuropathological and clinical effects upon i.c. transmission of brain, stomach wall and muscle tissue as well as blood from PD patients in TgM83(+/?) mice up to 612 dpi.

Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science, Andy Clark seminally proposed that the brain's job is to predict whatever information is coming next on the basis of prior inputs and experiences. Perception fundamentally subserves survival and self-preservation in biological agents, such as humans. Survival however crucially depends on rapid and accurate information processing of what is happening in the here and now. Hence, the term next in Clark's seminal formulation must include not only the temporal dimension (i.e., what is perceived now) but also the spatial dimension (i.e., what is perceived here or next-to-my-body). In this paper, we propose to focus on perceptual experiences that happen next, i.e., close-to-my-body. This is because perceptual processing of proximal sensory inputs has a key impact on the organism's survival. Specifically, we focus on tactile experiences mediated by the skin and what we will call the extended skin or second skin, that is, immediate objects/materials that envelop closely to our skin, namely, clothes. We propose that the skin and tactile experiences are not a mere border separating the self and world. Rather, they simultaneously and inherently distinguish and connect the bodily self to its environment. Hence, these proximal and pervasive tactile experiences can be viewed as a transparent bridge intrinsically relating and facilitating exchanges between the self and the physical and social world.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sentinel and study sites collected nasopharyngeal specimens for diagnostic detection, virus isolation, antigenic characterization, sequencing and antiviral susceptibility analysis from patients who fulfilled case definitions for influenza-like illness, acute lower respiratory infections and event-based surveillance. Each year in Cambodia, influenza viruses were detected mainly from June to November, during the rainy season. Antigenic analysis show that A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the A/California/7/2009-like group. Circulating A/H3N2 strains were A/Brisbane/10/2007-like in 2009 before drifting to A/Perth/16/2009-like in 2010 and 2011. The Cambodian influenza B isolates from 2009 to 2011 all belonged to the B/Victoria lineage represented by the vaccine strains B/Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. Sequences of the M2 gene obtained from representative 2009C2011 A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 strains all contained the S31N mutation associated with adamantanes resistance except for one A/H1N1pdm09 strain isolated in 2011 that lacked this mutation. No reduction in the susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was observed among the influenza viruses circulating from 2009 to 2011. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/H3N2 strains clustered each year to a distinct group while most A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the S203T clade. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In Cambodia, from 2009 to 2011, influenza activity occurred throughout the year with peak seasonality during the rainy season from June to November. Seasonal influenza epidemics were due to multiple genetically distinct viruses, even though all of the isolates were antigenically similar to the reference vaccine strains. The drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains revealed that neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective.","output":"Epidemiological and Virological Characteristics of Influenza Viruses Circulating in Cambodia from 2009 to 2011"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) causes a highly infectious disease with reported mortality in the range 2.8% to 47%. The replication and transcription of the SFTSV genome is performed by L polymerase, which has both an RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain and an N-terminal endonuclease (endoN) domain. Due to its crucial role in the cap-snatching mechanism required for initiation of viral RNA transcription, the endoN domain is an ideal antiviral drug target. In this virtual screening study for the identification of potential inhibitors of the endoN domain of SFTSV L polymerase, we have used molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to explore the natural product space of 14 011 phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants. After generating a heterogeneous ensemble of endoN domain structures reflecting conformational diversity of the corresponding active site using MD simulations, ensemble docking of the phytochemicals was performed against the endoN domain structures. Apart from the ligand binding energy from docking, our virtual screening workflow imposes additional filters such as drug-likeness, non-covalent interactions with key active site residues, toxicity and chemical similarity with other hits, to identify top 5 potential phytochemical inhibitors of endoN domain of SFTSV L polymerase. Further, the stability of the proteinCligand docked complexes for the top 5 potential inhibitors was analyzed using MD simulations. The potential phytochemical inhibitors, predicted in this study using contemporary computational methods, are expected to serve as lead molecules in future experimental studies towards development of antiviral drugs against SFTSV.","output":"Virtual screening of phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants against the endonuclease domain of SFTS virus L polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness and social isolation are serious public health concerns associated with higher risks of clinical depression, suicidal ideation, coronary artery disease, stroke, functional decline, an increased risk of developing dementia and cancer mortality. Recent reports indicate the prevalence and dangers of loneliness and social isolation have increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among older populations. In order to address these concerns among residents living at Northgate II (NGII), a 302-unit affordable housing development in Camden, NJ, Fair Share Support Services, Inc. (FSSS), the non-profit arm of Fair Share Housing Development, collaborated with the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging (NJISA) and the DHHS-funded Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) to develop a loneliness/social isolation survey using two evidenced-based tools, the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Steptoe Social Isolation Index. FSSS piloted the loneliness and social isolation survey with 192 low-income minority older adults residing at NGII. Results indicate that 49% of the NGII residents surveyed fall into 5 \\"at-risk\\" categories: 1) lonely and isolated (9%), 2) lonely/somewhat isolated (8%), 3 ) lonely/not isolated (9%), 4) isolated/somewhat lonely (9%), and 5) isolated/not lonely (14%).

Although GPS data has been used to study city-level outbreaks, current approaches fail to capture the path of infection at the individual level. Consequently, in this paper, we extend the usefulness of epidemics prediction from estimating the size of an outbreak at the population level to estimating the individuals who may likely get infected within a finite period of time. To this end, we propose a network-based method to first build and then prune the dynamic contact networks for recurring interactions; these networks can serve as the backbone topology for mechanistic epidemics modeling. We test our method using Foursquare's Points of Interest (POI) smart- phone geolocation data from over 1.3 million devices and show that we can recreate the COVID-19 infection curves for two major (yet very different) US cities (i.e., Austin and New York City) while maintaining the granularity of individual transmissions and reducing model uncertainty.

The use of cannabinoids for alleviation of motor symptoms has been extensively explored in pre-clinical studies. Objective We aim to systematically review and meta-analyze literature on the use of medical cannabis or its derivatives (MC) in PD patients to determine its effect on motor function and its safety profile. Methods We reviewed and analyzed original, full-text randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Primary outcomes were change in motor function and dyskinesia. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and side effects. All studies were analyzed for risk of bias. Results Fifteen studies, including six RCTs, were analyzed. Of these, 12/15 (80%) mention concomitant treatment with antiparkinsonian medications, most commonly levodopa. Primary outcomes were most often measured using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) among RCTs and patient self-report of symptom improvement was widely used among observational studies. Most of the observational data lacking appropriate controls had effect estimates favoring the intervention. However, the controlled studies demonstrated no significant motor symptom improvement overall. The meta-analysis of three RCTs, including a total of 83 patients, did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in UPDRS III score variation (MD -0.21, 95% CI -4.15 to 3.72; p = 0.92) with MC use. Only one study reported statistically significant improvement in dyskinesia (p < 0.05). The intervention was generally well tolerated. All RCTs had a high risk of bias. Conclusion Although observational studies establish subjective symptom alleviation and interest in MC among PD patients, there is insufficient evidence to support its integration into clinical practice for motor symptom treatment.

Also, a modified approach is the need of hour in taking care of patients as urologists should safeguard their teams, families, and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The authors have used guidelines from USA, Canada, UK, Europe and India for making recommendations to help urologist define their own policies that may have to be fine-tuned on the basis of continued and evolving challenges they would encounter and the local resources at their disposal. RESULTS COVID-19 do effect genitourinary system from kidney to testis.

In this work, we combined atomistic simulations and conformational dynamics analysis with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding interactions for a diverse panel of SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with nanobodies. Using this computational toolkit we identified dynamic signatures and binding affinity fingerprints for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E+U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies.

By quantifying dynamic and energetic determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 S binding with nanobodies, we also examine the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations. We found that mutational escape mechanisms may be controlled through structurally and energetically adaptable binding hotspots located in the host receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. The results of this study suggested a mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobody can modulate the global protein response and induce the increased resilience to common escape mutants.","output":"Atomistic Simulations and Deep Mutational Scanning of Protein Stability and Binding Interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Complexes with Nanobodies: Molecular Determinants of Mutational Escape Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aiming to improve post-disaster care of medical staff, we conducted an early and ongoing assessment of post-disaster psychologic distress and quality of life (QOL) in one center of a disaster-response hospital.

METHODS: Data of 402 cancer patients undergoing active treatment from February 24 to April 24, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed; several indicators of the Department functioning were also analyzed. RESULTS: Dedicated measures allowed an overall limited reduction of the workload. Decrease of radiotherapy treatment number reached 17%, while the number of administration of systemic treatment and follow up evaluations kept constant. Conversely, new treatment planning faced substantial decline. Considering the patients, infection rate was 3.23% (13/402) and mortality 1.24% (5/402). Median age of COVID-19 patients was 69.7 years, the large majority were male and smokers (84.6%); lung cancer was the most common tumor type (61.5%), 84.6% of subjects were stage III-IV and 92.3% had comorbidities. Remarkably, 92.3% of the cases were detected before March 24. Globally, only 2.5% of ongoing treatments were suspended due to suspect or confirmed COVID-19 and 46.2% of positive patients carried on radiotherapy without interruption.

N. caninum DNA was detected in 1.8% (4/227) of bats, i.e., 1.7% (1/60) in Rousettus leschenaultia, 1.7% (1/58) in Hipposideros pomona, 2.9% (2/69) in Rhinolophus pusillus, and none (0/40) in Myotis daubentoniid. The findings of the present study are only the first indication that bats could serve as an intermediate host, and further studies are necessary to confirm whether bats are involved in the transmission of N. caninum infections.","output":"Detection of Neospora caninum DNA by polymerase chain reaction in bats from Southern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid uptake of digital technology into the operating room has the potential to improve patient outcomes, increase efficiency of the use of operating rooms, and allow surgeons to progress quickly up learning curves. These technologies are, however, dependent on huge amounts of data, and the consequences of their mismanagement are significant. While the field of artificial intelligence ethics is able to provide a broad framework for those designing and implementing these technologies into the operating room, there is a need to determine and address the ethical and data governance challenges of using digital technology in this unique environment. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to define the term digital surgery and gain expert consensus on the key ethical and data governance issues, barriers, and future research goals of the use of artificial intelligence in surgery. METHODS: Experts from the fields of surgery, ethics and law, policy, artificial intelligence, and industry will be invited to participate in a 4-round consensus Delphi exercise. In the first round, participants will supply free-text responses across 4 key domains: ethics, data governance, barriers, and future research goals. They will also be asked to provide their understanding of the term digital surgery. In subsequent rounds, statements will be grouped, and participants will be asked to rate the importance of each issue on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (critically important). Consensus is defined a priori as a score of 7 to 9 by 70% of respondents and 1 to 3 by less than 30% of respondents. A final online meeting round will be held to discuss inclusion of statements and draft a consensus document. RESULTS: Full ethical approval has been obtained for the study by the local research ethics committee at Imperial College, London (20IC6136). We anticipate round 1 to commence in January 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will define the term digital surgery, identify the key issues and barriers, and shape future research in this area.

In some regions such as the temperate northern hemisphere there are fears of \\"second waves\\" of infections over the coming months, while in other, vulnerable regions such as Africa and South America, concerns remain that cases may still rise, further impacting local economies and livelihoods. Despite substantial research efforts to date, it remains unresolved as to whether COVID-19 transmission has the same sensitivity to climate and seasonality observed for other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza. Here we investigate any empirical evidence of seasonality using a robust estimation framework. For 304 large cities across the world, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using logistic growth curves fitted to cumulative case data. We then assessed evidence for association with climatic variables through mixed-effects and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression while adjusting for city-level variation in demographic and disease control factors. We find evidence of association between temperature and R0 during the early phase of the epidemic in China only. During subsequent pandemic spread outside China, we instead find evidence of seasonal change in R0, with greater R0 within cities experiencing shorter daylight hours (direct effect coefficient = -0.247, p = 0.006), after separating out effects of calendar day. The effect of daylight hours may be driven by levels of UV radiation, which is known to have detrimental effects on coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In the global analysis excluding China, climatic variables had weaker explanatory power compared to demographic or disease control factors. Overall, we find a weak but detectable signal of climate variables on the transmission of COVID-19. As seasonal changes occur later in 2020, it is feasible that the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 may shift in a detectable manner. However, rates of transmission and health burden of the pandemic in the coming months will be ultimately determined by population factors and disease control policies.","output":"Impact of climatic, demographic and disease control factors on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in large cities worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BeckwithCWiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a rare overgrowth disease and is not usually associated with intellectual delay. Living with a chronic illness condition such as BWS, however, might affect emotional-behavioral functioning and psychosocial development. To investigate this issue, parents of 30 children with BWS between 1.5 and 6 years old compiled standardized questionnaires assessing the presence of emotional-behavioral and developmental problems. The group mean scores in each scale of behavioral problems fell within the average range. Nevertheless, 23% of the sample presented scores beyond the risk threshold for social withdrawal. As regards psychomotor development, a lower mean score was reliable in the social domain compared to other developmental scales, and in the gross-motor compared to fine-motor functions. Moreover, scores in the at-risk band were reliable in almost half of the children for social development. Notably, older age was overall associated with higher emotional-behavioral and developmental difficulties, while no other socio-demographic or clinical variables accounted for the scores obtained in the questionnaires. These findings ask for a wider consideration by health and educational professionals of the psychosocial functioning of children with BWS, so as to early detect at-risk conditions and eventually promote adequate interventions.","output":"Psychosocial Difficulties in Preschool-Age Children with BeckwithCWiedemann Syndrome: An Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Novel Coronavirus, commonly known as COVID-19, is a highly contagious disease that spreads all over the globe has brought great suffering. The symptoms have made all ages suffer a lot. The diagnostics of COVID-19 is an excellent challenge for the medical field as the mutated form of the virus gives out its symptoms in different forms. The main diagnostics to be involved in this infection of COVID-19 is the Lung operation. Especially the automatic detection of the lungs' infection using chest X-rays provides the comprehensive possibility for healthcare professionals to develop hospital procedures to handle this COVID-19. Computed tomography scans are used to diagnose the lungs' infection caused by the Coronavirus, whereas the C.T. scans break the infected region from lung lesions. It is imperative to measure the disease progression, which is challenging to track down and treat accurately. Currently, Segmenting the contaminated regions from the C.T. slices can create loads of problems, which involves more alteration in contamination nature and minor power disagreement in the center of the infected tissues and the typical material. This chapter aims to segment the infection in the lungs using SqueezeNet as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the contaminated regions automatically. This approach may be useful to help in the accuracy of the C.T more accurately. It has been ensured based on Dice scores, sensitivity, and high precision, specificity.

Due to the less available studies on potential target proteins of lipopeptide based drugs, their potential inhibitory role for more obvious treatment on disease have not been explored in the direction of lead optimization. However, Computational approaches need to be utilized to explore drug discovery aspects on lipopeptide based drugs, which are time saving and cost-effective techniques. METHODS: Here a ligand-based drug discovery approach is coupled with reverse pharmacophore-mapping for the prediction of potential targets for antiviral (SARS-nCoV-2) and anticancer lipopeptides. Web-based servers PharmMapper and Swiss Target Prediction are used for the identification of target proteins for lipopeptides surfactin and iturin produced by Bacillus subtilis. RESULTS: The studies have given the insight to treat the diseases with next-generation large molecule therapeutics. Results also indicate the affinity for Angiotensin-Converting Enzymes (ACE) and proteases as the potential viral targets for these categories of peptide therapeutics.

In general, alcohol\\\\related problems increased during the pandemic, by 49% for women and 69% for men, but the reasons for the problems remain unclear. The findings were published online last week by the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. Both men and women report increases in negative consequences from their drinking as the pandemic goes on, said Joan Tucker, lead author of the study and a senior behavioral scientist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. For men, this finding is particularly striking in that the increase in alcohol\\\\related problems during the pandemic was occurring even as there was a steady decline in the amount they were drinking. An earlier RAND survey found that among women there was a pronounced increase in frequency of drinking days and binge drinking days from pre\\\\pandemic to early pandemic. This study surveyed 1,118 people in the RAND American Life Panel about their alcohol consumption during three time periods  May to July 2020, October to November 2020 and during March 2021. The study found that feelings of loneliness and motivations for using alcohol during the pandemic may play a role in alcohol consumption patterns. For both men and women, stronger coping and social motives for drinking early in the pandemic were associated with an initial higher level of alcohol use, and stronger coping motives were associated with an initial higher level of alcohol problems.","output":"Alcohol during the pandemic: Steady for women, down for men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is one of the major global health threats of the 21st century, causing unprecedented humanitarian crises worldwide.

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a survey with IM attendings and trainees at a large academic medical center in Western Pennsylvania. We used descriptive statistics to characterize attitudes towards medication abortion provision, including the belief that it is within their scope of practice and interest in future provision, and to explore perceived barriers to provision. We used logistic regression models to assess factors associated with each of these attitudes. RESULTS Of 397 eligible attendings and trainees, 121 (30%) completed the survey. Among those surveyed, 44% believed medication abortion is within the scope of practice of IM PCPs with trainees and female-identifying providers being significantly more likely to believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice compared to attending physicians and male physicians (60% vs. 30%, p<0.01 and 53% vs 31%, p=0.01, respectively). Similarly, 43% endorsed interest in future provision, with trainees (67% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) and female providers (54% vs. 27%, p=0.002) being more likely to express interest. The most cited barriers to provision included limited training in residency (70%) and low familiarity with abortion medications (57%). CONCLUSIONS Many IM providers- particularly trainees- believe medication abortion is within their scope of practice and would like to provide this care. Interventions are needed to provide education and assistance complying with state and federal regulations to enable safe and efficient medication abortion provision by IM providers.

Viroporins form transmembrane pores in host cells via oligomerization, thereby destroying cellular homeostasis and inducing cytopathy for virus replication and virion release. Among the Picornaviridae family of viruses, the 2B protein encoded by enteroviruses is well understood, whereas the viroporin activity of the 2B protein encoded by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has not yet been described. An analysis of the FMDV 2B protein domains by computer-aided programs conducted in this study revealed that this protein may contain two transmembrane regions. Further biochemical, biophysical and functional studies revealed that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells. The protein was found to be mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with both the N- and C-terminal domains stretched into the cytosol. It exhibited cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, which attenuated 2B protein expression. The release of virions from cells infected with FMDV was inhibited by amantadine, a viroporin inhibitor. The 2B protein monomers interacted with each other to form both intracellular and extracellular oligomers. The Ca(2+) concentration in the cells increased, and the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane was disrupted in cells that expressed the 2B protein. Moreover, the 2B protein induced intense autophagy in host cells. All of the results of this study demonstrate that the FMDV 2B protein has properties that are also found in other viroporins and may be involved in the infection mechanism of FMDV.","output":"Viroporin Activity of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Non-Structural 2B Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several professionals, including teachers, have been engrossed in fear of the worst happening due to COVID-19 and the rapidly evolving nature of the virus affecting the perception of safety in any working environment.

Clarifying the relationship between diet quality and knee OA could provide useful information for knee OA management. To investigate the associations between diet quality and knee joint structures, symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life in people with knee OA. METHODS This study was a post-hoc, exploratory analysis using data from a randomized controlled trial in symptomatic knee OA participants with a follow-up time of 24 months. In brief, eligible participants of the original study were aged 50-79 years, had symptomatic knee OA, and had a pain of 20-80 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale. After excluding the patients without information on diet quality, 392 participants were included in this post-hoc analysis. Diet quality was assessed at baseline using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) which includes subscores of vegetable, fruit, grain, dairy products, fat, and alcohol. Knee joint structures (including cartilage volume, cartilage defect, bone marrow lesions, and effusion-synovitis volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging), OA symptoms, lower limb muscle strength, depressive symptoms, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and follow up. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations of diet quality with those outcomes. RESULTS Diet quality mainly reflect diet variety within the core food was not associated with knee structures and OA symptoms, but was associated with greater lower limb muscle strength ( = 0.66, P = 0.001), lower depressive symptom ( = -0.08, P = 0.001), and better quality of life ( = -0.06, P = 0.002).

The sheer volume of news produced daily necessitates the development of automated methods for separating fact from fiction. To tackle this issue, the computer science community has produced a plethora of approaches, documented in a number of surveys. However, these surveys primarily rely on one-dimensional solutions, i.e., deception detection approaches that focus on a specific aspect of misinformation, such as a particular topic, language, or source. Misinformation is considered a major obstacle for situational awareness, including cyber, both from a company and a societal point of view.

We analyze and compare existing research on cross-dimensional methodologies. Our evaluation process is based on a set of criteria, including a predefined set of performance metrics, data pre-processing features, and domains of implementation. Furthermore, we assess the adaptability of each methodology in detecting misinformation in real-world news and thoroughly analyze our findings. Specifically, survey insights demonstrate that when a detection approach focuses on several dimensions (e.g., languages and topics, languages and sources, etc.), its performance improves, and it becomes more flexible in detecting false information across different contexts. Finally, we propose a set of research directions that could aid in furthering the development of more advanced and accurate models in this field.","output":"Misinformation vs. Situational Awareness: The Art of Deception and the Need for Cross-Domain Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sharing research data from public funding is an important topic, especially now, during times of global emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, when we need policies that enable rapid sharing of research data Our aim is to discuss and review the revised Draft of the OECD Recommendation Concerning Access to Research Data from Public Funding The Recommendation is based on ethical scientific practice, but in order to be able to apply it in real settings, we suggest several enhancements to make it more actionable In particular, constant maintenance of provided software stipulated by the Recommendation is virtually impossible even for commercial software Other major concerns are insufficient clarity regarding how to finance data repositories in joint private-public investments, inconsistencies between data security and user-friendliness of access, little focus on the reproducibility of submitted data, risks related to the mining of large data sets, and sensitive (particularly personal) data protection In addition, we identify several risks and threats that need to be considered when designing and developing data platforms to implement the Recommendation (e g , not only the descriptions of the data formats but also the data collection methods should be available) Furthermore, the non-even level of readiness of some countries for the practical implementation of the proposed Recommendation poses a risk of its delayed or incomplete implementation ? 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences All rights reserved","output":"OECD Recommendations draft concerning access to research data from public funding: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The biologic mechanisms leading to aneurysm healing or rare complications such as delayed aneurysm ruptures after flow-diverter placement remain poorly understood. We used RNA sequencing following implantation of coils or flow diverters in elastase aneurysms in rabbits to identify genes and pathways of potential interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms were treated with coils (n = 5) or flow diverters (n = 4) or were left untreated for controls (n = 6). Messenger RNA was isolated from the aneurysms at 4 weeks following treatment. RNA samples were processed by using RNA-sequencing technology and were analyzed by using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. RESULTS With RNA sequencing for coiled versus untreated aneurysms, 464/9990 genes (4.6%) were differentially expressed (58 down-regulated, 406 up-regulated). When we compared flow-diverter versus untreated aneurysms, 177/10,041 (1.8%) genes were differentially expressed (8 down-regulated, 169 up-regulated). When we compared flow-diverter versus coiled aneurysms, 13/9982 (0.13%) genes were differentially expressed (8 down-regulated, 5 up-regulated). Keratin 8 was overexpressed in flow diverters versus coils. This molecule may potentially play a critical role in delayed ruptures due to plasmin production. We identified overregulation of apelin in flow diverters, supporting the preponderance of endothelialization, whereas we found overexpression of molecules implicated in wound healing (dectin 1 and hedgehog interacting protein) for coiled aneurysms. Furthermore, we identified metallopeptidases 1, 12, and 13 as overexpressed in coiled versus untreated aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS We observed different physiopathologic responses after endovascular treatment with various devices. Flow diverters promote endothelialization but express molecules that could potentially explain the rare delayed ruptures. Coils promote wound healing and express genes potentially implicated in the recurrence of coiled aneurysms.","output":"Differential Gene Expression in Coiled versus Flow-Diverter-Treated Aneurysms: RNA Sequencing Analysis in a Rabbit Aneurysm Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Severe COVID-19 pneumonia can be complicated by secondary bacterial or fungal infections, but their clinical distinction from isolated SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging, especially with the more restricted practices regarding invasive diagnostics in patients with COVID-19. We sought to comprehensively screen for secondary infections by DNA pathogens (bacterial, fungal or viral) with a non-invasive, culture-independent metagenomic approach (microbial cell-free DNA sequencing-mcfDNA-Seq), and also examine for the biologic impact of circulating mcfDNA on the host response in COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 42 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compared them with a historical cohort of mechanically-ventilated patients with culture-positive (n=27) vs. culture-negative pneumonia (n=40) or no clinical infection (n=16 controls). From plasma samples, we performed mcfDNA-Seq with the Karius test (Karius, Inc) and measured 10 host-response biomarkers of innate immunity and epithelial/endothelial injury (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RAGE, TNFR1, Angiopoietin-2, Procalcitonin, Fractalkine, Pentraxin-3, ST2). We compared mcfDNA-Seq between clinical groups and examined associations of mcfDNA and biomarker levels with linear regression models. Results: McfDNA-Seq was successful in 33/42 (79%) baseline samples from patients with COVID-19, with nine samples failing QC requirements. McfDNA was detectable in 21/33 (64%) of COVID-19 samples, a proportion significantly lower to culture-positive pneumonia (96%), higher than uninfected controls (31%) and similar to culture-negative pneumonia (56%) (between-groups Fisher's exact p&lt;0.001). A similar distribution was seen for mcfDNA levels, with mcfDNA load in COVID-19 being similarly distributed as non-COVID culture-negative pneumonia (Figure 1A). Among patients with COVID-19, mcfDNA was significantly associated with higher levels of host-response biomarkers (Figure 1B), with stronger effect sizes observed for biomarkers of innate immunity (IL-8 and ST2) and bacterial infections (procalcitonin and pentraxin-3). Conclusions: Plasma metagenomics in patients with COVID-19 revealed mcfDNA load of similar magnitude as in critically-ill patients without COVID-19 with clinically suspected infection but negative microbiologic cultures. The significant associations of mcfDNA with host inflammation support the biological relevance of detectable circulating mcfDNA. Our preliminary results warrant further study of secondary infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to define the clinical utility of noninvasive molecular diagnostics for antimicrobial treatment guidance.","output":"Plasma microbial cell-free dna is associated with intensified host inflammation and can reveal secondary infections in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has challenged public health systems worldwide. Therefore, large-scale testing capacity is extremely important diagnosis and exclusion diagnosis. However, fixed laboratories are limited or far away from remote areas. Fortunately, MBS-Lab is characterized by high mobility and rapid on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. MBS-Lab was first used in northern Australia during a melioidosis outbreak in 1997. The MBS-Lab and a well-trained diagnostic team were dispatched to Dongchang District, Tonghua City, Jilin Province, China to assist the SARS-CoV-2 virus screening and diagnosis on January 17, 2021. Altogether, 93,952 oropharyngeal swabs samples were collected and tested among the high-risk groups and the general population in Dongchang District. Two single samples were identified as positive in the second turn screening. In the second turn screening, 3 mixed samples (10 in 1) were identified as positive; 10 mixed samples were identified as positive in the third turn screening. By resampling again, one and four cases were identified as positive, respectively. The positive cases were properly isolated and treated in hospital and avoided to visit family members, friends, colleagues and any other persons. Through this way of large-scale screening, human-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively avoided. In addition, all staff members strictly executed multiple safety precautions and reduce exposure risks. In the end, none of the staffs was infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus or other pathogens. As an emergency facility for infectious disease control, the MBS-Lab satisfies the requirements of ports and other remote areas far from fixed laboratories and supplements the capabilities of fixed laboratories.","output":"Screening High-Risk Groups and the General Population for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acids in a Mobile Biosafety Laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gamification, or adding elements of games to training systems, has the potential to increase learner engagement and information retention.

We assessed the usefulness of the angiography-derived hemodynamic index (ADDED), which is based on the extent of myocardium at risk and on the anatomical lesion severity, in predicting type 4a MI in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) undergoing PCI. We enrolled 442 patients treated with single-vessel PCI. The ADDED index was calculated as the ratio of the Duke Jeopardy Score to the minimum lumen diameter assessed with quantitative angiography analysis. Type 4a MI was defined according to the 4th Universal Definition of MI. The overall population was divided into tertiles of ADDED index. Type 4a MI occurred in 5 patients (3.3%) in the ADDED-low tertile, 8 (5.5%) in the ADDED-mid tertile, and 26 (17.7%) in the ADDED-high tertile (p < 0.0001). At ROC curve analysis, the ADDED index could significantly discriminate between patients with and without type 4a MI (area under the curve 0.745). At multivariate analysis, an ADDED index value > 5.25 was the strongest independent predictor type 4a MI. Our results support the role of the ADDED index as a predictor of type 4a MI in patients with CCS treated with elective PCI of a single vessel.

Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected. The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries. In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels (r = -0.42, 95%, p = 0.005).

Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others.

The purpose of this study was to assess HCP willingness to get vaccinated and identify specific concerns that would undermine vaccination efforts. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between November 23 (rd) ,2020 and December 5 (th) ,2020. The survey evaluated attitudes, beliefs and willingness to get vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5287 respondents had a mean age of 42.5 years (SD=13.56), and were 72.8% female (n=3842). Overall 57.5 % of individuals expressed intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. 80.4% were physicians and scientists representing the largest group. 33.6% of registered nurses, 31.6% of allied health professionals, and 32% of masters level clinicians were unsure they would take the vaccine (p<.001). Respondents who were older, males, White, or Asian were more likely to get vaccinated compared to other groups.

However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction.

Therefore, knowledge on the involved molecular processes downstream of OXT receptor (OXTR) activation is indispensable. We reveal that alternative splicing of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2 (CRFR2) parallels increased anxiety-like behavior following chronic OXT treatment, contrasting the well-known anxiolysis of acute OXT. In detail, chronic OXT shifts the splicing ratio between membrane-bound (mCRFR2) and soluble CRFR2 (sCRFR2) in favor of the latter via ERK1/2-MEF2A signaling. Targeted manipulations of Crfr2 splicing mimic the effect of chronic OXT, confirming its role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, chronic OXT triggers cytoplasmic distribution and extracellular release of sCRFR2 into the cerebrospinal fluid, with sCRFR2 levels positively correlating with anxiety-like behavior. Concluding, the dichotomy between anxiolytic mCRFR2 and anxiogenic sCRFR2 is the basis for the deleterious effects of chronic OXT on anxiety.

Here, we harness the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK-A) that contains a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to enhance DNA delivery into the nucleus of CHO cells. We show that co-expression of NDPK-A during transient expression results in improved transfection efficiency in CHO cells, presumably due to enhanced transportation of plasmid DNA into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Furthermore, introduction of the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1), a protein that is capable of inducing extrachromosomal maintenance, when coupled with complementary oriP elements on a transient plasmid, was utilised to reduce the effect of plasmid dilution.

After controlling for other exposures, there was non-significant evidence of a modest association between being a frontline HCW (any level) and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity compared to non-frontline status (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.84-2.30, p=0.200). There was 15% increase in the odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity for each step along the frontline exposure gradient (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.32, p=0.043). Conclusion We found a high SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG seropositivity with modest evidence for a dose-response association between increasing levels of frontline exposure risk and seropositivity. Even in well-resourced hospital settings, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, in addition to other transmission-based precautions for inpatient care of SARS-CoV-2 patients could reduce the risk of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline HCW.","output":"Association between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and antibody status among healthcare workers in two London hospitals: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Steep delay discounting, or a greater preference for smaller-immediate rewards over larger-delayed rewards, is a common phenomenon across a range of substance use and psychiatric disorders. Non-substance behavioral addictions (e.g., gambling disorder, internet gaming disorder, food addiction) are of increasing interest in delay discounting research. Individual studies have reported steeper discounting in people exhibiting various behavioral addictions compared to controls or significant correlations between discounting and behavioral addiction scales; however, not all studies have found significant effects. To synthesize the published research in this area and identify priorities for future research, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (following PRISMA guidelines) of delay discounting studies across a range of behavioral addiction categories. The final sample included 78 studies, yielding 87 effect sizes for the meta-analysis. For studies with categorical designs, we found statistically significant, medium-to-large effect sizes for gambling disorder (Cohen's d = 0.82) and IGD (d = 0.89), although the IGD effect size was disproportionately influenced by a single study (adjusted d = 0.53 after removal). Categorical internet/smartphone studies were non-significant (d = 0.16, p = 0.06). Aggregate correlations in dimensional studies were statistically significant, but generally small magnitude for gambling (r = 0.22), internet/smartphone (r = 0.13) and food addiction (r = 0.12). Heterogeneity statistics suggested substantial variability across studies, and publication bias indices indicated moderate impact of unpublished or small sample studies. These findings generally suggest that some behavioral addictions are associated with steeper discounting, with the most robust evidence for gambling disorder. Importantly, this review also highlighted several categories with notably smaller effect sizes or categories with too few studies to be included (e.g., compulsive buying, exercise addiction). Further research on delay discounting in behavioral addictions is warranted, particularly for categories with relatively few studies.","output":"Delay Discounting in Established and Proposed Behavioral Addictions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare system has been effectively administered in such a way that doctors and patients are perceiving it with recent advancements in technologies such as a Chatbot.

Recent years have brought exciting insights and developments in IL-1-targeted therapies. Here, we present an overview of past and present research focusing on the role of IL-1 in cancer, with a special focus on clinical research and on therapeutic implications. With this, we strive to assist scientists in their future research objectives and to highlight possible directions for IL-1-targeting therapies in the coming years. ABSTRACT: Since its discovery, interleukin-1 has been extensively studied in a wide range of medical fields. Besides carrying out vital physiological functions, it has been implicated with a pivotal role in the progression and spreading of different cancer entities. During the last years, several clinical trials have been conducted, shedding light on the role of IL-1 blocking agents for the treatment of cancer. Additionally, recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology have implicated IL-1-induced signaling cascades as a major driver of severe chimeric antigen receptor T cell-associated toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity. In this review, we summarize current clinical trials investigating the role of IL-1 blockade in cancer treatment and elaborate the proposed mechanism of these innovative treatment approaches. Additionally, we highlight cutting-edge developments utilizing IL-1 blocking agents to enhance the safety and efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy.","output":"Therapeutic Strategies for Targeting IL-1 in Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of psychotropic medication on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is limited, while associated with a higher risk of adverse events. Non-pharmacological treatment of BPSD is advocated as treatment of first choice. However, many general practitioners (GPs) find it difficult to initiate deprescribing, and when attempting to discontinue psychotropic medication in nursing home residents, they face many barriers. Therefore, we hypothesize that an intervention aimed at improving communication with and involvement of nursing home staff, relatives, and patients by GPs can optimize the pharmacological treatment of BPSD. The aim is to reduce the use of antidepressants in nursing home residents with dementia without increasing morbidity or mortality. OBJECTIVE: The primary outcome is reduction of antidepressant. Secondary outcomes include difference in use of other psychotropic medication, mortality, morbidity, and severity of BPSD. METHOD: The study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial based in general practices in Denmark. We aim to include 22 practices, each of which will recruit up to 15 patients with dementia living in nursing homes. The intervention period is 3 months, and the total study period is 1 year. Randomization is 1:1 to intervention and control group by computer algorithm. Both groups receive education on BPSD and its evidence-based treatment. The intervention includes three tailored components; (1) teaching material and training to be used by the GP to educate nursing home staff on BPSD, (2) a pre-visit reflection tool to encourage nursing home staff to evaluate symptoms and reflect on relatives involvement in the discontinuation process; and (3) a dialog tool to facilitate shared decision making on optimization of BPSD treatment during the visits at the nursing home. The control group includes enhanced care as usual. The primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at the end of the study period. A process evaluation will be conducted to assess the implementability. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that the intervention will optimize the treatment of BPSD with antidepressants for nursing homes residents and enhance compliance with reduction of medication. The process evaluation should provide insights into the barriers and facilitators to changing the current practice of deprescribing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04985305.

Participants stated the FLM to be fun, different, instructive, useful, advantageous, and flexible in terms of in-class practices. They also found the FLM to be fun owing to its features such as facilitating learning, being flexible, and providing opportunities for practice. Moreover, the participants regarded the FLM as fun, useful, advantageous, flexible, and effective in terms of out-of-class practices. Another result was that no significant difference was found between the emotional semantic orientations of the female and male gifted students in terms of in-class practices. However, in terms of out-of-class practices, there was a significant difference between the scores obtained from the answers given for the effective-ineffective adjective pair in favor of male participants, while there a significant difference between the scores obtained from the answers given for the fun-boring adjective pair in favor of female participants.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has further exacerbated existing health disparities among AA communities. Understanding how AA women have experienced and responded to stress during the pandemic may help to inform how future interventions can better address physical and mental well-being in AA communities. AIMS: Drawing from stress and coping models and an ecological framework, the present study conducted a theory-based qualitative assessment of stress-related experiences during the pandemic among a cohort of AA women, including (1) sources of stress, (2) coping strategies, (3) perceptions of health-related behaviors, (4) the role of community, and (5) recommendations for future interventions. METHOD: After completing a group-based physical activity intervention program during the COVID-19 pandemic, a cohort of AA women (N =17, Mage= 49.3  11.24) completed individual interviews. Sessions were conducted by phone, audiotaped, transcribed, and coded by independent raters (rs = .71-.73). Themes were identified using deductive and inductive approaches. RESULTS: Among sources of stress directly related to the pandemic, being at home, getting sick, and homeschooling/parenting were the most frequently discussed themes. Participants engaged in active coping (problem and emotion-focused), with health behaviors, social support, and religion/spirituality, emerging as frequently discussed themes. Although some participants reported passive coping strategies (e.g., avoidance), this approach was less pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: These qualitative results are used to guide suggestions for future interventions that jointly address stress and health-related behaviors in order to improve translation of research into practice and policy for future pandemics and disasters.","output":"Evaluating Experiences of Stress and Coping Among African American Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Inform Future Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common but urgent mental health problem during disease outbreaks. Resilience buffers against the negative impacts of life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology such as GAD. This study assesses the prevalence of GAD and examines the protective or compensatory effect of resilience against worry factors during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Chinese citizens aged 18 years from January 31 to February 2, 2020. A total of 4827 participants across 31 provinces and autonomous regions of the mainland of China participated in this study. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and a self-designed worry questionnaire were used to asses anxiety disorder prevalence, resilience level, and anxiety risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associations of resilience and worry factors with GAD prevalence after controlling for other covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety disorder was 22.6% across the 31 areas, and the highest prevalence was 35.4% in Hubei province. After controlling for covariates, the results suggested a higher GAD prevalence among participants who were worried about themselves or family members being infected with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 3.40, 95%CI 2.43C4.75), worried about difficulty obtaining masks (AOR 1.92, 95%CI 1.47C2.50), worried about difficulty of distinguishing true information (AOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.36C2.02), worried about the prognosis of COVID-19 (AOR 2.41, 95%CI 1.75C3.33), worried about delays in working (AOR 1.71, 95%CI 1.27C.31), or worried about decreased income (AOR 1.45, 95%CI 1.14C1.85) compared with those without such worries. Additionally, those with a higher resilience level had a lower prevalence of GAD (AOR 0.59, 95%CI 0.51C0.70). Resilience also showed a mediating effect, with a negative influence on worry factors and thereby a negative association with GAD prevalence.

Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin.

Tramadol overdose is associated with adverse cardiac effects due to inhibiting cardiac Na+ and K+ channels. This study aimed to investigate the potential ameliorative role of 3% hypertonic saline on the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in patients presenting with tramadol poisoning. METHODS: This was a single-center, controlled, randomized, single-blind clinical trial. Patients were randomized into the case (received hypertonic saline) and control (received placebo) groups. ECG was obtained twice in each group (upon arrival and following the intervention). Response to therapeutic interventions was evaluated using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included. The mean age of patients was 24.88  4.29 years, and 62 (81.6%) were male. The mean ingested dose of tramadol was 1673.68  608.85 (range: 550-2750) mg.

We designed this project to study virusChost interactions and viral pathogenesis. A pulldown assay was used to investigate the association between foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and DDX21. Further insight into the DDX21CFMDV interaction was obtained through dual-luciferase, knockdown, overexpression, qPCR, and confocal microscopy assays. Our results highlight the antagonistic feature of DDX21 against FMDV, as it progressively inhibited FMDV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -dependent translation through association with FMDV IRES domains 2, 3, and 4. To subvert this host helicase antagonism, FMDV degraded DDX21 through its non-structural proteins 2B, 2C, and 3C protease (3C(pro)). Our results suggest that DDX21 is degraded during 2B and 2C overexpression and FMDV infection through the caspase pathway; however, DDX21 is degraded through the lysosomal pathway during 3C(pro) overexpression. Further investigation showed that DDX21 enhanced interferon-beta and interleukin-8 production to restrict viral replication.

To assess the degree to which these impacts vary, we analyzed data from 3098 participants between the ages of 40 and 79 from an online survey in Germany. Data were collected at three measurement occasions between the start of the nationwide lockdown in mid-March 2020 and the end of the lockdown in early August 2020. The survey focused on everyday experiences during the COVID-19 crisis and collected various satisfaction ratings (e.g., general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, satisfaction with social contacts). At baseline, participants also provided retrospective ratings of satisfaction for the period before the COVID-19 crisis. In our analyses, we compared satisfaction ratings of middle-aged (40C64 years) and older individuals (65C79 years) and found that both middle-aged and older participants experienced the greatest decreases in satisfaction with social contacts, with more pronounced decreases seen in middle-aged participants. A similar pattern was observed for general life satisfaction, but the overall decreases were less pronounced in both groups compared to the decreases in satisfaction with social contacts. We also observed a partial recovery effect in all measures at the last measurement occasion, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults. Findings were also confirmed using age as a continuous variable and checking for linear and nonlinear effects of outcomes across the age range. Although ageism arose during the pandemic in the sense that older adults were labeled as a risk group, particularly at the start of the outbreak, we found consistently with other studies that middle-aged adults satisfaction decreased to a greater extent than that of older adults.

With the beginning of the space age in 1957, a new branch of geodesy was created, satellite geodesy. Only with satellites did geodesy become truly global. Oceans were no longer obstacles and the Earth as a whole could be observed and measured in consistent series of measurements. Of particular interest is the determination of the spatial structures and finally the temporal changes of the Earth's gravitational field. The knowledge of the gravitational field represents the natural bridge to the study of the physics of the Earth's interior, the circulation of our oceans and, more recently, the climate. Today, key findings on climate change are derived from the temporal changes in the gravitational field: on ice mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica, sea level rise and generally on changes in the global water cycle. This has only become possible with dedicated gravity satellite missions opening a method known as satellite gravimetry. In the first forty years of space age, satellite gravimetry was based on the analysis of the orbital motion of satellites. Due to the uneven distribution of observatories over the globe, the initially inaccurate measuring methods and the inadequacies of the evaluation models, the reconstruction of global models of the Earth's gravitational field was a great challenge. The transition from passive satellites for gravity field determination to satellites equipped with special sensor technology, which was initiated in the last decade of the twentieth century, brought decisive progress. In the chronological sequence of the launch of such new satellites, the history, mission objectives and measuring principles of the missions CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE flown since 2000 are outlined and essential scientific results of the individual missions are highlighted.

RESULTS: A n early and markedly negative impact on family finances, fear of working with COVID-19 patients and ethical issues related to COVID-19 care among HCWs was observed. A total of seven target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and which may therefore benefit from an intervention were identified, namely women, subjects aged less than 42 years, people with a care burden, socioeconomically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, patients with COVID-19 and HCWs working with patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience and to prepare an adequate organisational response should be encouraged for the seven groups identified as high risk and susceptible to benefit from an intervention.

Purpose of this paper is to investigate and prioritize the factors that are responsible for supply chain vulnerability. Extant literature review and interviews with the experts helped to extract 26 supply chain vulnerability factors. Further, the relative criticality of vulnerability factors is assessed by analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Critical part supplier; location of supplier; long supply chain lead times; Fixing process owners and mis-aligned incentives in supply chain are identified as the most critical factors among twenty-six vulnerability factors. Research concludes that not only long and complex supply chain but supply chain practices adopted by firms also increase supply chain vulnerability. Relative assessment of vulnerability factors enables professionals to take appropriate mitigation strategies to make the supply chains more robust.

Most current serological evaluation of CP relies on examination of total immunoglobulin or IgG-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. However, IgA antibodies, which also circulate and are secreted along the respiratory mucosa, represent a relatively uncharacterized component of CP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Residual samples from patients and CP donors were assessed for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain responsible for viral entry. Symptom onset was obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Increased IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels correlated with clinical improvement and viral clearance in an infant with COVID-19, prompting a broader examination of IgA levels among CP donors and hospitalized patients. Significant heterogeneity in IgA levels was observed among CP donors, which correlated weakly with IgG levels or the results of a commonly employed serological test. Unlike IgG and IgM, IgA levels were also more likely to be variable in hospitalized patients and this variability persisted in some patients >14 days following symptom onset. IgA levels were also less likely to be sustained than IgG levels following subsequent CP donation. CONCLUSIONS: IgA levels can be very heterogenous among CP donors and hospitalized patients and do not necessarily correlate with commonly employed testing platforms. Examining isotype levels in CP and COVID-19 patients may allow for a tailored approach when seeking to fill specific gaps in humoral immunity.","output":"Are We Forgetting About IgA?

To minimise this risk, UK Armed Forces (UKAF) recruits receive a prevention-focused dental care intervention during military training (known as 'Project MOLAR') before their entry to the trained strength of the Armed Forces.Aim To evaluate whether Project MOLAR is effective in preventing future dental emergency events and subsequent oral disease in UKAF recruits.Methods This is a retrospective cohort analysis of UKAF recruits who enlisted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011, conducted by analysing electronic primary dental care records. Adverse outcomes were defined as: i) incidence of dental emergency events during the five-year follow-up period; and ii) further oral disease at 18 months measured by an increase in Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT).Results In total, 7,361 recruits met the inclusion criteria. The total follow-up time for the cohort was 31,957 person-years (mean follow-up 4.3 years/recruit). Individuals whose treatment was completed under Project MOLAR were found to experience a 30% reduction in dental emergency incidence (RR: 0.70-95% CI: 0.63-0.76) (p <0.001) and a 64% reduction in the odds of DMFT increase at 18 months (OR: 0.36-95% CI: 0.28-0.47) (p <0.001) compared to individuals whose treatment was incomplete.Conclusions Defence dentistry's focus on delivering prevention-focused dentistry early in a recruit's military career confers a downstream benefit to personnel who complete the intervention, such that dental emergency occurrences and DMFT progression are significantly reduced.","output":"Does prevention-focused dental care provision during recruit training reduce adverse dental outcomes in UK Armed Forces personnel?

The non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) patient who is at risk of, or may already be suffering from, a number of the associated complications of CKD, represents an ideal patient group for the development of such initiatives. The current COVID-19 pandemic, and drive towards shielding vulnerable individuals, has further highlighted the need for home testing pathways. In this narrative review we outline the evidence supporting remote patient management and the various technologies in use in the POCT setting. We then review the devices currently available for use in the home by patients in five key areas of renal medicine: anaemia, biochemical, blood pressure, anticoagulation and diabetes monitoring. Currently there are few devices and little evidence to support the use of home POCT in CKD; while home testing in blood pressure, anticoagulation and diabetes monitoring are relatively well developed, the fields of anaemia and biochemical POCT are still in their infancy. However, patients attitudes towards eHealth and home POCT are consistently positive and physicians also find this care highly acceptable. The regulatory and translational challenges involved in the development of new home based care pathways are significant. Pragmatic and adaptable trials of a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, as well as continued technological POCT device advancement, are required to deliver these innovative new pathways that our patients desire and deserve.","output":"Point-of-Care Testing Technologies for the Home in Chronic Kidney Disease: a Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The unique constraints to everyday life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been shown to negatively impact those with pre-existing mental health issues such as eating disorders. While individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating behaviours represent a vulnerable group to COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the pandemic is yet to be fully established. As such, we systematically examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviours. Method: We searched electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE for literature published until October 2021. Eligible studies were required to report on individuals with or without a diagnosed eating disorder or disordered eating behaviours who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Seventy-two studies met eligibility criteria with the majority supporting an increase in eating disorder or disordered eating behaviours associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, children and adolescents and individuals with a diagnosed eating disorder present a vulnerable group to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: This systematic review provides a timely insight into COVID-19 eating disorder literature and will assist in understanding possible future long-term impacts of the pandemic on eating disorders behaviours. It appears that the role of stress in the development and maintenance of eating disorders was intensified as a means to cope with the uncertainty of the pandemic. Future research is needed among understudied and minority groups and to examine the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviours.","output":"The impacts of COVID-19 on eating disorders and disordered eating: A mixed studies systematic review and implications for healthcare professionals, carers, and self (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ischemic colitis (IC) is a severe emergency in gastrointestinal surgery. The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of postoperative mortality after emergent open colectomy for IC treatment. Additionally, we compared postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing emergent colectomy due to aortic surgery-related IC (AS-IC group) vs. other IC etiologies (Other-IC group). METHODS: We analyzed records of consecutive patients who underwent emergency open colectomy for IC between 2008 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and operative parameters associated with postoperative mortality. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups were compared for mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival. RESULTS: During the study period, 94 patients (mean age, 67.4  13.7 years) underwent emergent open colectomy for IC. In the majority of cases, IC involved the entire colon (53.2%) and vasopressor agents were required preoperatively (63.8%) and/or intraoperatively (78.8%). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to AS-IC, whereas 60 due to Other-IC causes. In the AS-IC group, 9 patients had undergone endovascular aortic repair and 25 open aortic surgery; 61.8% of patients needed aortic surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). Overall, 66 patients (70.2%) died within 90 days from surgery. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups showed similar operative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. However, the duration of the ICU stay (19 days vs. 11 days; p = 0.003) and of the total hospital stay (22 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.016) was significantly longer for the AS-IC group than for the Other-IC group. The rate of intestinal continuity restoration at 1 year after surgery was higher for the Other-IC group than for the AS-IC group (58.8% vs. 22.2%; p = 0.05). In the multivariate model, preoperative increased lactate levels, a delay between signs/symptoms' onset and surgery > 12 h, and the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury were statistically associated with postoperative mortality. Neither IC etiology (aortic surgery vs. other etiology) nor ruptured AAA was associated with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Emergency open colectomy for IC is associated with high postoperative mortality, which appears to be unrelated to the IC etiology. Preoperative lactate levels, > 12-h delay to surgery, and postoperative acute kidney injury are independent predictors of postoperative mortality.","output":"Predictors of mortality following emergency open colectomy for ischemic colitis: a single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent concern on the environmental protection and COVID-19 issue is increasingly affecting the manufacturing industry.

The study is essential to provide insight for the manufacturing industry regarding the consequences and benefits of practicing the green supply chain and adopting ERP technology amid the current constraints of the environmental protection issue and the COVID-19 pandemic. The study has surveyed 122 companies domiciled in Indonesia. Data collection used a questionnaire designed with a seven-point Likert scale. Questionnaire created in Google form, printed and distributed using social media and postal mail. Data analysis used SmartPLS software version 3.0. The result revealed that ERP adoption enables green purchasing, production, distribution, and operational performance. Furthermore, operating performance is directly affected by green purchasing and green production. However, operating performance was not supported by green distribution. In addition, ERP adoption indirectly improves operational performance through green purchasing and green production. But ERP adoption did not affect operational performance through green distribution. This result provides essential insight for the manager in the manufacturing industry that adopting ERP in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic and practicing environmental protection such as green purchasing, green production enhances operational performance. In summary, the result of this study encourages the practitioner to adopt environmental protection in running their business since it benefits the company. While there are very few studies examining the relationship between ERP adoption, green supply chain practices, and operational performance, this study is essential in terms of exploring the mediating role of green supply chain practices on the effect of ERP adoption on operational performance.

Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action. METHODS: An electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic and then useful data were extracted and appraised by experienced clinicians. We evaluated the quality of included evidences by using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered to be eligible for this systematic review. Visual analog scale (VAS), Harris hip scores, and the imaging results were the frequently-used outcome estimates of included studies. CONCLUSION: By systematically analyzing these evidences, we could conclude that ESWT could act as a safe and effective method to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral hip, especially those at early stage. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. Collaboration with other conservative modalities would not improve the curative benefits of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method.

We aimed to identify global inequities in HD care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The International Society of Nephrology(ISN) and Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study(DOPPS) conducted a global online-survey of HD units between March and November, 2020 to ascertain practice patterns and access to resources relevant to HD care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were categorized according to World Bank income classification for comparisons. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 412 facilities in 78 countries: 15(4%) in Low Income Countries (LIC), 111(27%) in Lower-middle Income Countries (LMIC), 145(35%) in upper-middle income countries (UMIC) and 141(34%) in high-income countries (HIC). Respondents reported that diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable or of limited availability in LIC(72%) and LMICs(68%) as compared to UMIC(33%) and HIC(20%). The number of patients who missed HD treatments was reported to have increased during the COVID19 pandemic in LIC(64%) and LMIC(67%) as compared to UMIC(31%) and HICs(6%). Limited access to HD, intensive care unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation among hospitalized COVID-19 chronic dialysis patients was also reportedly higher in LIC and LMIC as compared to UMIC and HIC. Staff in LLMIC reported less routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 when asymptomatic as compared to UMIC and HIC - 14% in LIC and 11% in LMIC, compared to 26% and 28% in UMIC and HIC respectively. Severe shortages of PPE were reported by respondents from LIC and LMIC compared to UMIC and HIC, especially with respect to the use of the N95 particulate - air respirator masks.

Yet there is a dearth of robust evidence to inform the governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other humanitarian organizations on how to best respond to them. The Fogarty International Center of the U.S. National Institutes of Health commissioned a collection of Research in Practice articles that highlights the experiences of scientists conducting research in the context of humanitarian crises. Unlike traditional research papers, the case analyses in this collection go beyond what research was completed and focus on why the research was important and how it was conducted in these extremely challenging settings. DISCUSSION: The papers selected for this collection span 27 countries, cover a broad range of humanitarian crises, and discuss a wide variety of disease and health risk factors. Of the 23 papers in the collection, 17 include an author from the affected country and five papers were authored by humanitarian NGOs. Throughout the collection, 43% of the authors were from low- and middle-income countries. Across the collection, some general themes emerged that are broadly applicable. Importantly, there is a clear need for more, high-quality research to address evidence gaps. Community engagement, already a key element to global health research, was highlighted as especially important for research involving populations dealing with severe trauma and disruption. Partnership with humanitarian actors, including local governments, local and international NGOs, and UN agencies, was found to be a critical strategy as well. CONCLUSION: A variety of audiences will find this collection useful. Global health educators can utilize papers to facilitate discussion around public health practice and equitable partnerships, among other topics. Humanitarian response organizations may use the collection to consider how research may inform and improve their work. Global health researchers, funders, and other stakeholders may use the collection to stimulate dialogue around key scientific research questions and better appreciate the importance of conducting research in humanitarian crises in the context of achieving broader global health goals.","output":"Introduction to collection: confronting the challenges of health research in humanitarian crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rearrangement of healthcare services required to face the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a drastic reduction in elective cardiac invasive procedures.

Furthermore, we wanted to estimate whether there is a multiplicative or additive effect of the increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages. Background New lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are of potential concern due to higher transmissibility, risk of severe outcomes, and/or escape from neutralizing antibodies. Lineage B.1.1.7 has been estimated to be more transmissible than other previously known lineages, but the association between transmissibility and risk factors, such as age of primary case and viral load is still unknown. Methods We used comprehensive administrative data from Denmark, comprising the full population, all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, and all WGS lineage data (January 11 to February 7, 2021), to estimate household transmissibility stratified by lineage B.1.1.7 and other lineages. Results We included 5,241 households with primary cases; 808 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 and 4,433 were infected with other lineages. The attack rate was 38% in households with a primary case infected with B.1.1.7 and 27% in households with a primary case infected with other lineages. Primary cases infected with B.1.1.7 had an increased transmissibility of 1.5-1.7 times that of primary cases infected with other lineages. The increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 was multiplicative across age and viral load. Conclusions The results found in this study add new knowledge that can be used to mitigate the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, which is becoming increasingly widespread in numerous countries. Our results clarify that the transmissibility of B.1.1.7 should be included as a multiplicative effect in mathematical models used as a tool for decision makers. The results may have important public health implications, as household transmission may serve as a bridge between otherwise separate transmission domains, such as schools and physical workplaces, despite implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions.","output":"Increased Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 by Age and Viral Load: Evidence from Danish Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esta nota tcnica tem trs objetivos: explorar a relao entre medidas legais de distanciamento social e o isolamento social de fato;analisar o quanto medidas legais de distanciamento respondem ao nvel de gravidade da epidemia;e analisar as alteraes em medidas de distanciamento ocorridas no perodo de 27 de abril a 10 de maio de 2020 A nota argumenta que o efeito das medidas legais de distanciamento social sobre o comportamento da populao se reduziu a partir do final do ms de mar?o: o rigor das medidas legais diminuiu, mas o isolamento social diminuiu proporcionalmente mais Argumenta tambm que as medidas de distanciamento tm sido cada vez mais uma resposta  gravidade da epidemia do que uma medida preventiva que evitaria um cenrio de epidemia mais grave Por fim, destacam-se o relaxamento das medidas ocorrido em alguns estados (Minas Gerais, Esprito Santo e Rond?nia), a ampliao das restries em outros (Par, Maranh?o e Cear) e a introduo de polticas regionalizadas em alguns estados (Rio Grande do Sul, sobretudo) Os dados indicam que polticas de distanciamento tm se tornado progressivamente descentralizadas, com alguns estados delegando cada vez mais poder s prefeituras Isso pode levar a uma sada descoordenada e catica da quarentena","output":"Covid-19 e medidas legais de distanciamento social: descentralizao das polticas, relao com o nmero de bitos e anlise do perodo de 27 de abril a 10 de maio de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus 19 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic forced an unprecedented shift of postoperative care for cardiac surgery patients to telemedicine.

METHODS: A cohort study at a New York City hospital at the peak of the early pandemic in the United States, under crisis conditions. The aim was to determine the benefit of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes included changes in physiologic parameters. Fine-Gray competing risks models with stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting (sIPTW) were used to determine the effect of prone positioning on outcomes. In addition, linear mixed effects models (LMM) were used to assess changes in physiology with prone positioning. RESULTS: Out of 335 participants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, 62 underwent prone positioning, 199 met prone positioning criteria and served as controls and 74 were excluded. The intervention and control groups were similar at baseline. In multivariate-adjusted competing risks models with sIPTW, prone positioning was significantly associated with reduced mortality (SHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80, P < 0.005). Using LMM to evaluate the impact of positioning maneuvers on physiological parameters, the oxygenation-saturation index was significantly improved during days 1-3 (P < 0.01) whereas oxygenation-saturation index (OSI), oxygenation-index (OI) and arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2: FiO2) were significantly improved during days 4-7 (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19 is associated with reduced mortality and improved physiologic parameters.

They are mostly commensal unless there are certain not so well-defined factors that trigger the conversion to a pathogenic state. Some of the factors that induce such transition can be dependent on the fungal species, environment, immunological status of the individual, and most importantly host genetics. In this review, we discuss the different aspects of how host genetics play a role in fungal infection since mutations in several genes make hosts susceptible to such infections. We evaluate how mutations modulate the key recognition between the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and the host pattern recognition receptor (PRR) molecules. We discuss the polymorphisms in the genes of the immune system, the way it contributes toward some common fungal infections, and highlight how the immunological status of the host determines fungal recognition and cross-reactivity of some fungal antigens against human proteins that mimic them. We highlight the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with several of the receptor coding genes and discuss how it affects the signaling cascade post-infection, immune evasion, and autoimmune disorders. As part of personalized medicine, we need the application of next-generation techniques as a feasible option to incorporate an individuals susceptibility toward invasive fungal infections based on predisposing factors.

Accumulating evidence suggests that many of the adverse health effects of PM(2.5) exposure are associated with lung inflammation and oxidative stress. While the physical structure and surface chemistry of PM(2.5) are surrogate measures of particle oxidative potential, little is known about their contributions to negative health effects. In this study, we used functionalized carbon black particles as surrogates for atmospherically aged combustion-formed soot to assess the effects of PM(2.5) surface chemistry in lung cells. We exposed the BEAS-2B lung epithelial cell line to different soot at a range of concentrations and assessed cell viability, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

Prioritization of MHC-I restricted viral epitopes remains a fundamental challenge for understanding adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a consensus MHC-I binding prediction model, EnsembleMHC, based on the biochemical and structural basis of peptide presentation to aid the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides. We performed immunopeptidome predictions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins across 52 common MHC-I alleles identifying 658 high confidence peptides. Analysis of the resulting peptide-allele assignment distribution demonstrated significant variation across the allele panel up to an order of magnitude. Using MHC-I population-based allele frequencies, we estimated the average SARS-CoV-2 peptide population binding capacity across 21 individual countries. We have discovered a strong inverse association between the predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we found that the consideration of only structural proteins produced a stronger association with observed death rate, highlighting their importance in protein-targeted immune responses. The 108 predicted SARS-CoV-2 structural protein peptides were shown to be derived from enriched regions in the originating protein, and present minimal risk for disruption by mutation.

In this study, we developed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to examine the effects of the various phases of movement control measures on disease transmissibility and the trend of cases during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. METHODS: Three SEIR models were developed using the R programming software ODIN interface based on COVID-19 case data from September 1, 2020, to March 29, 2021. The models were validated and subsequently used to provide forecasts of daily cases from October 14, 2020, to March 29, 2021, based on 3 phases of movement control measures.

We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001].

In Study 2, we utilize a discovery-oriented theories-in-use qualitative approach (with a sample of 27 sales professionals) to investigate the nature of salesperson social isolation (with certain pandemic related factors), its consequences (also considering pandemic related factors), and important manager and salesperson actions that offset the negative effects of salesperson social isolation. Altogether, our findings shed some light into the if, how, what (in much more detail), and when aspects of salesperson social isolation.

Methods: From 16th to 24th March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. Results: Observer agreement across the 3 categories was good between all readers (kappa value 0.68 95%CI 0.67-0.70) and good to very good between pairs of readers (0.64-0.85).

We investigated the role of individual and healthcare supply-related factors in HIV transmission risk in HIV-positive adults enrolled in 19 HIV services in the Centre and Littoral regions of Cameroon. METHODS: Factors associated with HIV transmission risk (defined as both unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use with HIV-negative or unknown status partners) were identified using a multi-level logistic regression model. Besides socio-demographic and behavioral individual variables, the following four HIV-service profiles, identified using cluster analysis, were used in regression analyses as healthcare supply-related variables: 1) district services with large numbers of patients, almost all practicing task-shifting and not experiencing antiretroviral drugs (ARV) stock-outs (n = 4); 2) experienced and well-equipped national reference services, most practicing task-shifting and not experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 5); 3) small district services with limited resources and activities, almost all experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 6); 4) small district services with a wide range of activities and half not experiencing ARV stock-outs (n = 4). RESULTS: Of the 1372 patients (women 67%, median age [Interquartile]: 39 [33C44] years) reporting sexual activity in the previous 12 months, 39% [min-max across HIV services: 25%-63%] were at risk of transmitting HIV. The final model showed that being a woman (adjusted Odd Ratio [95% Confidence Interval], p-value: 2.13 [1.60C2.82], p<0.001), not having an economic activity (1.34 [1.05C1.72], p = 0.019), having at least two sexual partners (2.45 [1.83C3.29], p<0.001), reporting disease symptoms at HIV diagnosis (1.38 [1.08C1.75], p = 0.011), delayed ART initiation (1.32 [1.02C1.71], p = 0.034) and not being ART treated (2.28 [1.48C3.49], p<0.001) were all associated with HIV transmission risk. Conversely, longer time since HIV diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of transmitting HIV (0.96 [0.92C0.99] per one-year increase, p = 0.024). Patients followed in the third profile had a higher risk of transmitting HIV (1.71 [1.05C2.79], p = 0.031) than those in the first profile.

It is necessary for the development and repair of the brain and protection from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which apoD interacts with lipoproteins in human plasma. By using detergent-free ELISA, we show that immobilized monoclonal antibodies against apoD very efficiently bind to low density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma; this binding is as equally efficient as binding to an anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Adding detergent to the plasma inhibited the binding, suggesting that the binding is dependent on the presence of intact lipoprotein particles. Reversing the system by using immobilized anti-apoB revealed that the affinity of apoD for LDL is rather low, suggesting that multiple bindings are needed for a durable connection. Biosensor experiments using purified lipoproteins also showed that purified apoD and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), a lipoprotein fraction rich in apoD, were both able to bind LDL very efficiently, indicating that the HDL3-LDL interaction may be a physiological consequence of the affinity of apoD for LDL. Furthermore, we found that apoD increases the binding of HDL to actively growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells but not to quiescent, contact-inhibited, confluent T24 cells. This result is especially intriguing given that the T24 supernatant only contained detectable levels of apoD after growth inhibition, raising the possibility that alternating the expression of apoD and a putative apoD-receptor could give direction to the flow of lipids. In the current paper, we conclude that apoD mediates binding of HDL to LDL and to growing T24 carcinomas, thereby highlighting the importance of apoD in lipid metabolism.","output":"ApoD Mediates Binding of HDL to LDL and to Growing T24 Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity (a lack of stable access to nutritious food) is reliably associated with obesity, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Past research indicates that this relationship may, in part, be explained by the distress of being food insecure and using food as a coping mechanism. While previous work has focused on long-term food insecurity, the first COVID-19 national lockdown presented a unique opportunity to establish if the same relationships existed for individuals experiencing pandemic related food insecurity. Adults in the United Kingdom (N = 211) were recruited three months after the first UK lockdown via social media. They completed questionnaires on COVID-19 related food insecurity, physical stress, psychological distress, eating to cope, drinking to cope, diet quality, and changes in weight promoting eating behaviours (e.g. consuming larger portions, increased snacking) since the start of the lockdown. A structural equation model revealed that food insecurity was indirectly associated with changes in weight promoting eating behaviours. As predicted, the more instances of pandemic related food insecurity, the more distress individuals reported. Distress was then associated with eating as a way of coping, which in turn was associated with increases in weight promoting eating behaviours. Food insecurity was also indirectly associated with diet quality, but this was via distress only. These results reflect similar pathways observed in individuals reporting chronic food insecurity and strengthens the evidence that distress and eating to cope are generic mediators of food insecurity and eating behaviour.","output":"The association between COVID-19 related food insecurity and weight promoting eating behaviours: the mediating role of distress and eating to cope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary infection of 2019-nCoV can frequently induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (pO2/FiO2) of less than 300 mmHg.

This problem has primarily been approached by predicting the magnitude of the placebo response via stable factors, such as demographic variables, and/or by developing complex designs aimed at reducing the placebo response in the hope that it will improve the test of the active treatment. Yet, the success of this approach has so far been limited. Methods A new approach toward improving the RCT is put forward based on placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, i.e. studies that investigate the mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. In a series of meta-analyses the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects were determined. Experimental studies across nociplastic and neuropathic pain conditions and across pharmacological and acupuncture treatments investigated psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects. The obtained results were used to make approximations of expectations to see if that could predict the placebo response in RCTs and function as a new way of tapping into the placebo component of treatment effects. Results The magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects is large and highly variable. Placebo effects exist across chronic pain conditions with varying degrees of known etiology as well as across pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Patients' perception of the treatment, the verbal suggestions given for pain relief, and the patients' expectations toward pain relief contribute to the magnitude of the placebo effect and to pain relief following placebo interventions. Also, unintentional unblinding and patients' perception of a treatment markedly influence the treatment outcome. By making approximations of expectations toward treatment effects it was possible to predict the magnitude of the placebo response in RCTs. Conclusions and implications The new approach of tapping into or directly asking patients about their perception and expectations toward a treatment, along with the account of the natural history of pain, has the potential to improve the information that can be obtained from RCTs. Thus, by interfacing insights from placebo and nocebo mechanism studies, it may be possible to enhance the information that can be obtained from RCTs and to account for a large part of the variability in the placebo component of the overall treatment effect. This approach has the potential to improve the scientific evaluation of treatments, as well as to illustrate how the effect of treatments can be optimized in clinical practice, which is the crux of evidence-based medicine.","output":"Can insights from placebo and nocebo mechanisms studies improve the randomized controlled trial?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) that emerged at the end of 2019 stated in China and infected millions of people around the world, with the highest spread rate among humans compared with other coronaviruses.

This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on anxiety, depression and resilience in Dutch children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) or primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and their caregivers during the second wave of the pandemic. Methods: Adolescents (12C18 years), adults and caregivers of children (0C18 years) with CF or PCD completed screening questionnaires from Sept-Dec 2020 on anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and resilience (BRS). The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 was measured by the Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS) part 2, which was translated into Dutch using EMA guidelines. Results from the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were compared to participants pre-pandemic scores. Results: 65 individuals participated (CF: 6 adolescents, 32 caregivers. PCD: 17 patients, 10 caregivers). Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression (score of 5 on the GAD-7 and/or PHQ-9) during the pandemic was high (34% and 37% respectively for CF, 48% and 37% PCD), but median GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores during the pandemic (CF: GAD-7 = 3.0 and PHQ-9 = 2.5;PCD: GAD-7 = 3.0 and PHQ-9 = 4.0) did not differ from the pre-pandemic outcomes for both groups (CF: GAD-7 = 2.0 and PHQ-9 = 2.0;PCD: GAD-7 = 5.0, PHQ-9 = 5.0).

Regardless of the pandemic wave, the patients most commonly reported weaknesses were a cough and a headache. The arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia were the most frequent concomitant chronic conditions. Hospitalized patients more often reported weakness or a cough while home-isolated patients were more likely to have rhinitis or a headache. Patients who completed the vaccination course showed a shorter duration of clinical symptoms and a lower mean number of symptoms. Additionally, vaccinated individuals reported less taste and/or olfactory dysfunction than unvaccinated individuals.

One way to increase uptake is to take advantage of environments outside of primary care which present easy opportunities for vaccination. This study provides a narrative review of hospital-based strategies in acute care settings aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates for adult inpatients. METHODS: A search was conducted using Scopus, Embase and PubMed databases for articles reporting on hospital-based interventions aimed at improving influenza vaccination for adults. Studies published in English were included and descriptively analysed. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles were included. Tested interventions included 7 standing order protocols (SOP); 4 reminders; 4 assessment/administration programs; 1 patient education program; 1 organisational-based program; 7 multi-component strategies and 8 studies comparing SOPs with other strategies. One article was included in both SOPs and reminders categories. Studies were published between 1983 and 2017 and conducted in the USA, Canada, or Australia. 18 studies reported statistical significance. Individually, each type of intervention showed success. SOPs were significantly more effective than other individual interventions, but multi-component interventions (which included an SOP) were more effective than SOPs alone. Three articles reported no significant increase in uptake attributed mainly to patient refusals, even with a strategy involving patient education. Only three studies tested provider-level strategies including hospital campaigns, hospital reward programs and interdepartmental competitions, and showed success. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-based interventions are an effective means of improving opportunistic inpatient vaccination. Suggestions for future research include organisational or system-based interventions; qualitative review of barriers and enablers to inpatient vaccination programs; and re-examination of outpatient settings for vaccine delivery. Most studies were not randomised or controlled; therefore, we also recommend additional RCT studies to confirm existing findings on individual strategies.","output":"A review of hospital-based interventions to improve inpatient influenza vaccination uptake for high-risk adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isolated reports of new-onset diabetes in patients with COVID-19 have led researchers to hypothesise that SARS-CoV-2 infects the human exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells ex vivo and in vivo.

Here, we found that cats infected with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited hyperglycaemia. We also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the pancreatic tissues of these cats, and immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the islet cells.

And, the disease caused by the virus is named the new coronavirus disease 2019 and it will be abbreviated as 2019-nCoV and COVID-19. As of January 30, 2020, the WHO classified this epidemic as a global health emergency (Chung et al. in Radiology 295(1):202-207, 2020). It is an international real-life problem. Due to deaths, globally everyone is under fear. Now, it is the responsibility of researchers to give hope to the people. In this article, we aim to better protect people and general pandemic preparedness by predicting the lifetime of the disease-causing virus using three mathematical models. This article deals with a complex real-life problem people face all over the world, an international real-life problem. The main focus is on the USA due to large infection and death due to coronavirus and thereby the life of every individual is uncertain. The death counts of the USA from February 29 to April 22, 2020, are used in this article as a data set. The death counts of the USA are fitted by the solutions of three mathematical models and a solution to an international problem is achieved. Based on the death rate, the lifetime of the coronavirus COVID-19 is predicted as 1464.76 days from February 29, 2020.

Despite its comparative cost-effectiveness and recent changes in reimbursement practices, inpatient teledermatology still lacks sufficient reimbursement incentive for widespread implementation. SUMMARY: Inpatient teledermatology is an effective, efficient, accurate, and cost-effective means of managing the hospital burden of skin disease, especially in areas where access to dermatologic care is limited.

As a consequence, a new scenario of multiple imperfect vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 arose. Mathematical modeling needs to consider this complex situation with different vaccines, some of them with two required doses. Using compartmental models we can simplify, simulate and most importantly, answer questions related to the development of the outbreak and the vaccination campaign. We present a model that addresses the current situation of COVID-19 and vaccination. Two important questions were considered in this paper: are more vaccines useful to reduce the spread of the coronavirus? How can we know if the vaccination campaign is sufficient? Two sensitivity criteria are helpful to answer these questions. The first criterion is the Multiple Vaccination Theorem, which indicates whether a vaccine is giving a positive or negative impact on the reproduction number. The second result (Insufficiency Theorem) provides a condition to answer the second question. Finally, we fitted the parameters with data and discussed the empirical results of six countries: Israel, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Italy, and Lithuania.","output":"Sensitivity theorems of a model of multiple imperfect vaccines for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy services are necessary for hospitalized patients of COVID-19 as well as chronic patients Thus, physiotherapists present an increased risk of exposure to coronavirus This study aimed to determine the number of physiotherapists who interrupted their services because of the COVID-19 pandemic and to verify the procedures adopted by the ones who are still working METHODS: The sample comprised 619 physiotherapists who worked in Portugal, 154 (24 9%) male and 465 (75 1%) female, aged between 22 and 67 years (34 47+/-8 70) The measurement instrument was an on-line questionnaire applied in late March 2020 through contacts and social networks RESULTS: 453 (73 2%) physiotherapists interrupted their work activities in person because of the pandemic and 166 (26 8%) continue to work in person The main measures adopted by physical therapists who continue to work in person included: hand washing (21 5%), mask use (20 3%), material disinfection (19 3%) and, glove use (19 3%) Of the physiotherapists who are not working in person (n = 453), 267 (58 9%) continue to monitor their patients at a distance, and 186 (41 1%) are not monitoring the patients The main measures used by physiotherapists to monitor their patients at a distance included: written treatment prescription (38%), making explanatory videos (26 7%), and synchronous video conference treatment (23 5%) CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that most of the physiotherapists interrupted their face-to-face practices because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, once they do not follow up their patients' treatment in person, most of them adapted to monitor their patients from a distance","output":"Physiotherapy services in the face of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concurrent prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV raises the concern for the emergence of potential new -CoV clades via genetic recombination, bearing high SARS-CoV-2-like transmissibility and high MERS-CoV-like mortality rates.

METHODS We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from married adolescent girls from rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India in 2015-2016 (N = 4,893). Gender role belief items assessed participants' beliefs regarding appropriateness of female marital choice and economic decision-making, male childcare responsibility, and marital violence. The outcomes were time with friends (social connection), freedom of movement, mobile phone ownership and internet access (digital connection), and safety from marital violence (marital safety). Adjusted regression models examined associations between gender role beliefs and outcomes, caste/religion beliefs related to segregation, and demographics. RESULTS Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.88, p = .048) and female economic decision-making (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03-1.99, p = .03) were associated with social connection. Beliefs supportive of female marital choice (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.31-2.71, p = .001), female economic decision-making (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03-2.72, p = .04), and male childcare responsibilities (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05-1.94, p = .03) were associated with freedom of movement. Belief supporting female marital choice was associated with mobile phone ownership (AOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.50, p = .04), and belief supporting male childcare responsibility was associated with internet access (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11-2.77, p = .02).

Children entered the cohort at the beginning of the RSV season, after a minimum of 60 days in ambulatory care, and were followed until the earliest of the following: season end, second birthday, loss of eligibility, hospitalization, or death. Study endpoint was the first RSV-related hospitalization. To evaluate the presence of confounding, a second endpoint, hospitalizations for pneumonia or bronchiolitis secondary to specified bacterial or viral pathogens other than RSV, was used. Palivizumab exposure defined as first use (day 1-30 of first dose), subsequent use (days 1-30 of each subsequent dose), and former use (days 31-60 after any dose if delays or no readministration occurred) was compared with non-use with a Cox regression model, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS Hazard ratios (HRs) for RSV hospitalizations were 0.89 (95%CI, 0.71-1.12), 0.56 (95%CI, 0.46-0.69), and 0.71 (95%CI, 0.51-0.97) for first, subsequent, and former use, respectively.

The influence of the media has also had a significant impact on the way women perceive hospital care in light of COVID-19 and for some, this has shaped whether they would seek help. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first ever reported study in the United Kingdom to explore pregnant women's perceptions of COVID-19 and their subsequent healthcare experiences.

This free-access educational website delivers asynchronous high-quality multidisciplinary critical care education targeted at critical care trainees. The lectures, presented in real time on-site, are recorded and available on the website or as a podcast on iTunes or Android. Thus, the curriculum can be easily accessed around the world. Objective: We sought to identify the impact this website has on current and former University of Maryland critical care trainees. Methods: A 32-question survey was generated using a standard survey generation tool. The survey was e-mailed in the fall of 2019 to the University of Maryland Multi-Departmental Critical Care current and graduated trainees from the prior 7 years. Survey data were collected through December 2019. The questions focused on user demographics, overall experience with the website, scope of website use, and clinical application of the content. Anonymous responses were electronically gathered. Results: A total of 186 current trainees and graduates were surveyed, with a 39% (n = 72) response rate. Of responders, 76% (55) use the website for ongoing medical education. The majority use the website at least monthly. Most users (63%, n = 35) access the lectures directly through the website. All 55 current users agree that the website has improved their medical knowledge and is a useful education resource. Platform use has increased and includes users from around the world. Conclusion: Based on our current data, the MarylandCCProject remains a valuable and highly used educational resource, impacting patient care both during and after critical care fellowship training.","output":"Seven-Year Follow-Up of an Online Critical Care Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the parent and staff experience of a secure video messaging service as a component of neonatal care. DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation incorporating quantitative and qualitative items. SETTING: Level II and level III UK neonatal units. POPULATION: Families of neonatal inpatients and neonatal staff. INTERVENTION: Use of a secure, cloud-based asynchronous video messaging service to send short messages from neonatal staff to families. Evaluation undertaken JulyCNovember 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental experience, including anxiety, involvement in care, relationships between parents and staff, and breastmilk expression. RESULTS: In pre-implementation surveys (n=41), families reported high levels of stress and anxiety and were receptive to use of the service. In post-implementation surveys (n=42), 88% perceived a benefit of the service on their neonatal experience. Families rated a positive impact of the service on anxiety, sleep, family involvement and relationships with staff. Qualitative responses indicated enhanced emotional closeness, increased involvement in care and a positive effect on breastmilk expression. Seventy-seven post-implementation staff surveys were also collected. Staff rated the service as easy to use, with minimal impact on workload. Seventy-one percent (n=55) felt the service had a positive impact on relationships with families. Staff identified the need to manage parental expectations in relation to the number of videos that could be sent. CONCLUSIONS: Asynchronous video messaging improves parental experience, emotional closeness to their baby and builds supportive relationships between families and staff. Asynchronous video supports models of family integrated care and can mitigate family separation, which could be particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Asynchronous video messaging promotes family involvement and mitigates separation in neonatal care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo evaluate the association of initial clinical symptoms with need for hospitalization, intensive care, or death in ED patients within 30 days after presenting with acute symptomatic COVID-19. MethodsThis study is a retrospective case-series of patients presenting to a single ED with acute symptomatic COVID-19 from March 7-August 9, 2020. Symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for this study. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 due to screening tests but had no reasonably associated symptoms were excluded. Participants were analyzed by three categories representative of clinical severity: intensive care unit (ICU) care/death, general ward admission, and ED discharge/convalescence at home. Outcomes were ascertained 30 days after initial presentation to account for escalation in severity after the ED visit. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to report odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between hospital or ICU care/death versus convalescence at home and between ICU care/death versus general ward admission. ResultsIn total, 994 patients were included in the study, of which, 551 (55.4%) patients convalesced at home, 314 (31.6%) patients required general ward admission, and 129 (13.0%) required ICU care or died. In the multivariable models, ED patients requiring hospital admission were more likely to be aged [] 65 years (adjusted OR [aOR] 7.4, 95% CI: 5.0, 10.8), Black/African American (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.8) or Asian/American Indian/Alaska Native/Other (aOR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3), and experience dyspnea (aOR 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.7) or diarrhea (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.2). However, they were less likely to experience sore throat (aOR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.6), myalgia (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.7), headache (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), or olfactory/taste disturbance (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8).

Global interconnectedness continues to increase with international travel and trade; economic, political, and cultural interactions; and human-to-human and animal-to-human interactions. These interactions include the accidental and deliberate sharing of microbial agents and antimicrobial resistance and allow the emergence of new and unrecognized microbial disease agents. As the 21st century begins, already new agents have been identified, and new outbreaks have occurred. Solutions to limiting the spread of emerging infectious diseases will require cooperative efforts among many disciplines and entities worldwide. This article defines emerging infectious diseases, summarizes historical background, and discusses factors that contribute to emergence. Seven agents that have made a significant appearance, particularly in the 21st century, are reviewed, including: Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, human monkeypox, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, and avian influenza.

Our study indicates that samples incubated with NT particles had detectable levels of infectious VEEV in blood equal to or greater than samples without NT treatment across all temperatures. Viral RNA detection was increased in the presence of NT particles at later time points (72 h) and higher temperature (40C) conditions. Likewise, detection of VEEV capsid protein was enhanced in the presence of NT particles up to 72 h at 40C. Finally, we intranasally infected C3H mice with TC-83, the live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV, and demonstrated that NT particles could substantially increase the detection of VEEV capsid in infected blood incubated up to 72 h at 40C. Samples without NT particles had undetectable capsid protein levels.

It is shown that the Court of Justice's C legally relevant(!) C assumptions on gambling addiction are (only) partly supported by empirical evidence. The chapter also establishes that different standards of review have applied to different aspects of gambling regulation, with the most lenient review being applied to national choices of licensing models and the strictest to penalties and procedural requirements in licensing tenders. In a next step, the Courts review practice is compared to judgments in other areas that involved similar consumer protection concerns (alcohol addiction and youth drinking; internet threats). Again, a diverging standard of review is noted. The chapter inquires the causes for the Courts peculiar approach to gambling issues. It analyses in particular the political context of the early case law and it identifies passages in the jurisprudence that illustrate a subjective-moral rather than objective-scientific perspective on gambling-related risks. Finally, the chapter addresses the consequences of the Courts diverging approach. Dealing with gambling as a peculiar issue and a topos of public morality led to a lack of a science-informed assessment of gambling-related risks.

Such models rely on virus- and disease characteristics of which most are uncertain or even unknown for SARS-CoV-2. This study addresses the validity of various assumptions using an epidemiological simulation model. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we show that multiple scenarios all lead to realistic numbers of deaths and ICU admissions, two observable and verifiable metrics. Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates for the number of infected and immune individuals, and show that these vary strongly between scenarios. Note that the amount of variation measured in this study is merely a lower bound: epidemiological modeling contains uncertainty on more parameters than the four in this study, and including those as well would lead to an even larger set of possible scenarios. As the level of infection and immunity among the population are particularly important for policy makers, further research on virus and disease progression characteristics is essential. Until that time, epidemiological modeling studies cannot give conclusive results and should come with a careful analysis of several scenarios on virus- and disease characteristics.","output":"Forecasting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is inherently ambiguous given the current state of virus research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) by the Central Bank of China is conducive to the central bank's timely grasp of macroeconomic dynamics and the internationalization of RMB.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized the novel coronavirus as the main cause of global pandemic. Patients infected with this virus generally show fever, nausea, and respiratory illness, while some patients also manifest gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been found in gastrointestinal cells. Further angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) the known receptor for the virus is extensively expressed in these cells. This implies that gastrointestinal tract can be infected and can also present them as a replication site for SARS-CoV-2, but since this infection may lead to multiple organ failure, therefore identification of another receptor is a plausible choice. This review aims to provide comprehensive information about probable receptors such as sialic acid and CD147 which may facilitate the virus entry. Several potential targets are mentioned which can be used as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19 and associated GI disorders. The gut microbiomes are responsible for high levels of interferon-gamma which causes hyper-inflammation and exacerbates the severity of the disease. Briefly, this article highlights the gut microbiome's relation and provides potential diagnostic approaches like RDT and LC-MS for sensitive and specific identification of viral proteins.

While primarily recognized as a respiratory disease, it is clear that COVID-19 is systemic illness impacting multiple organ systems. One defining clinical feature of COVID-19 has been the high incidence of thrombotic events. The underlying processes and risk factors for the occurrence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 remain inadequately understood. While severe bacterial, viral, or fungal infections are well recognized to activate the coagulation system, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is likely to have unique mechanistic features. Inflammatory-driven processes are likely primary drivers of coagulopathy in COVID-19, but the exact mechanisms linking inflammation to dysregulated hemostasis and thrombosis are yet to be delineated. Cumulative findings of microvascular thrombosis has raised question if the endothelium and microvasculature should be a point of investigative focus. von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its protease, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), play important role in the maintenance of microvascular hemostasis. In inflammatory conditions, imbalanced VWF-ADAMTS-13 characterized by elevated VWF levels and inhibited and/or reduced activity of ADAMTS-13 has been reported. Also, an imbalance between ADAMTS-13 activity and VWF antigen is associated with organ dysfunction and death in patients with systemic inflammation. A thorough understanding of VWF-ADAMTS-13 interactions during early and advanced phases of COVID-19 could help better define the pathophysiology, guide thromboprophylaxis and treatment, and improve clinical prognosis.","output":"Coagulopathy and Thrombosis as a Result of Severe COVID-19 Infection: A Microvascular Focus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objectives of this study were to collect data on the patient-provider relationship and evaluate the association between patient-provider racial concordance and patient experience during pregnancy.

However, the impact of COVID-19 on economic vulnerability has not previously been characterised. ObjectiveTo determine whether COVID-19 has a significant impact on adequacy of household income to meet basic needs (primary outcome) and work absence due to sickness (secondary outcome), both at the onset of illness (acutely) and subsequently (long-term). DesignMultivariate mixed regression analysis of self-reported data from monthly on-line questionnaires, completed 1st May 2020 to 28th October 2021, adjusting for baseline characteristics including age, sex, socioeconomic status and self-rated health. Setting and ParticipantsParticipants (n=16,910) were UK residents aged 16 years or over participating in a national longitudinal study of COVID-19 (COVIDENCE UK). ResultsIncident COVID-19 was independently associated with increased odds of participants reporting household income as being inadequate to meet their basic needs, both acutely (adjusted odds ratio [aOR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.73) and in the long-term (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.33). Exploratory analysis revealed the long-term association to be restricted to those who reported long COVID, defined as the presence of symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks after the acute episode (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.77).

Considering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group. The intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400 mg/kg, IV, daily for three days. Both groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care. The demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors. RESULTS: The mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84  3.35 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value = 0.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value = 0.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value = 0.003). There was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value < 0.001 and =0.01, respectively).

We show how the specific events, measures and developments during the epidemic affected the emergence of different kinds of hashtags and the ranking on the HSL. A significant increase of COVID-19 related hashtags started to occur on HSL around January 20, 2020, when the transmission of the disease between humans was announced.

We give an analysis of how the hashtag topics changed during the investigated time span and conclude that there are three periods separated by February 12 and March 12. In period 1, we see strong topical correlations and clustering of hashtags;in period 2, the correlations are weakened, without clustering pattern;in period 3, we see a potential of clustering while not as strong as in period 1. We further explore the dynamics of HSL by measuring the ranking dynamics and the lifetimes of hashtags on the list. This way we can obtain information about the decay of attention, which is important for decisions about the temporal placement of governmental measures to achieve permanent awareness.

The purpose of this study, the first including a large sample of the Spanish general population, was to analyze sexual behavior during the 99 days of confinement in Spain (INSIDE Project). Method: One thousand four hundred forty-eight Spanish people, between 18 and 60 years old, were evaluated through an online survey during April 2020. The variables analyzed were the physical and social environment during confinement, sexual desire, type of sexual activity, masturbation, sexual intercourse, online sexual activity, general sexual frequency, sexual fantasies, degree of self-control over sexual drive, sexual abuse, general impact of confinement on sexuality, and emotional mood. Results: Confinement has affected the sexual life of half of the Spanish population (47.7%), especially women. Those who reported a worsening of their sexual life are almost three times more (37.9%) than those who reported an improvement (14.4%). Conclusions: Different factors have been significant predictors of the positive or negative evaluation about the impact of this confinement on sexual life, such as gender, couple life, privacy, stress level, and the perception of confinement as unbearable.

Findings from this study are expected to establish connections between behavior and brain activities surrounding ToM in ASD, which may assist the development of neuroanatomical diagnostic criteria and provide a way to measure intervention outcomes.","output":"A Pilot Study Using Two Novel fMRI Tasks: Understanding Theory of Mind and Emotion Recognition Among Children With ASD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a receptor-based pharmacophore model for identifying FDA-approved drugs and hits from natural products. The COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) was selected for the development of the pharmacophore model. The model consisted of a hydrogen bond acceptor, donor, and hydrophobic features. These features demonstrated good corroboration with a previously reported model that was used to validate the present model, showing an RMSD value of 0.32. The virtual screening was carried out using the ZINC database. A set of 208,000 hits was extracted and filtered using the ligand pharmacophore mapping, applying the lead-like properties. Lipinskis filter and the fit value filter were used to minimize hits to the top 2000. Simultaneous docking was carried out for 200 hits for natural drugs belonging to the FDA-approved drug database. The top 28 hits from these experiments, with promising predicted pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, are reported here.

In the wake of this pandemic are patients, family members, and various types of care providers, all of whom share different levels of moral distress. Moral conflict occurs in disputes when individuals or groups have differences over, or are unable to translate to each other, deeply held beliefs, knowledge, and values. Such conflicts can seriously affect healthcare providers and cause distress during disastrous situations such as pandemics when medical and human resources are stretched to the point of exhaustion. In the current pandemic, most hospitals and healthcare institutions in the United States have not allowed visitors to come to the hospitals to see their family or loved ones, even when the patient is dying. The moral conflict and moral distress (being constrained from doing what you think is right) among care providers when they see their patients dying alone can be unbearable and lead to ongoing grief and sadness. This paper will explore the concepts of moral distress and conflict among hospital staff and how a system-wide provider wellness programme can make a difference in healing and health.","output":"COVID-19, Moral Conflict, Distress, and Dying Alone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is an undisputable fact that meshes have become standard for repair of abdominal wall hernias. Whereas in the late eighties there were only a couple of different devices available, today we have to choose among some hundreds, with lots of minor and major variations in polymer and structure. As most of the minor variations may not lead to significant change in clinical outcome and may be regarded as less relevant, we should focus on major differences. Eventually, this is used to structure the world of mesh by forming groups of textile devices with distinct biological response. Many experimental and some clinical studies have underlined the outstanding importance of porosity, which fortunately, in contrast to other biomechanical quanlities, is widely unaffected by the anisotropy of meshes. METHODS In accordance with the major manufacturers of meshes, a classification of meshes was derived from a huge pool of textile data based briefly on the following: (1) large pores, (2) small pores, (3) additional features, (4) no pores, (5) 3D structure and (6) biological origin. At 1,000 explanted meshes the value of this classification was evaluated by group-specific assessment of inflammatory and connective tissue reaction. RESULTS Application of this classification to common products has proved feasable, and each of the six different classes includes devices that in clinical trials failed to show relevant differences in patients' outcome when comparing products within the same group. Furthermore, histological analysis confirmed significant differences in tissue reactions between but not within the different classes. CONCLUSIONS Classifying implants according to a similar response enables grouping patients into comparable cohorts despite implantation of different devices. Furthermore, it enables the examination of the impact of mesh classes for the various indications even from heterogenous data of registries. Finally and not the least, any grouping supports the surgeon to select the best device to meet the individual need and to tailor patients therapy.","output":"Modified classification of surgical meshes for hernia repair based on the analyses of 1,000 explanted meshes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus was first identified in China in December 2019, causing several cases of the new type of pneumonia The exported cases were found in other countries, including countries in the Southeast Asia region At the same time, no cases were confirmed in Indonesia We aimed to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, precautionary actions, and perceived risk among general Indonesian population when there were no confirmed cases in Indonesia This study was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving 382 participants aged 17 years and above residing in Indonesia The data was collected through the online questionnaire from February 19th to February 29th 2020 The average score of COVID-19 related knowledge was 88 0%, whereas 83 8% of the participants had a high level of knowledge The average score of taking precautionary actions was 77 4% and 65 7% had a high level of performance In terms of the perceived risk of COVID-19, only 11 3% of the participants perceived themselves likely to acquire COVID-19 when compared with other diseases or accidents The perceived risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with precautionary action (p&lt;0 05) Perceived risk of COVID-19 was at a low level when there were no confirmed cases Effective strategies of risk communication are needed to improve precautionary actions to prevent COVID-19 ? 2021, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan - Faculty of Publich Health All rights reserved","output":"Knowledge, precautionary actions, and perceived risk of COVID-19 among indonesian people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exponential growth of commercial flights has resulted in a sharp rise of air travellers over the last 2 decades, including passengers with a wide range of cardiovascular conditions.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney;however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods and findings: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. Conclusions: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI.

The Japanese Prime Minister and governors requested people to adopt self-restraint behaviors, including working from home and refraining from visiting nightlife spots. However, the effectiveness of the mobility change due to such requests in reducing the spread of COVID-19 has been little investigated. The present study examined the association of the mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places and the COVID-19 outbreaks in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas in Japan. METHODS: First, we calculated the daily mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places compared to the mobility before the outbreak using mobile device data. Second, we estimated the sensitivity of mobility changes to the reproduction number by generalized least squares. RESULTS: Mobility change had already started in March, 2020. However, mobility reduction in nightlife places was particularly significant due to the state of emergency declaration. Although the mobility in each place type was associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, the mobility changes in nightlife places were more significantly associated with the outbreak than those in the other place types. There were regional differences in intensity of sensitivity among each metropolitan area.

It is unclear whether some respiratory support devices may increase the dispersion of infectious bioaerosols and thereby place healthcare workers at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objectives: To quantitatively compare viral dispersion from invasive and noninvasive respiratory support modalities. Methods: This study used a simulated ICU room with a breathing-patient simulator exhaling nebulized bacteriophages from the lower respiratory tract with various respiratory support modalities: invasive ventilation (through an endotracheal tube with an inflated cuff connected to a mechanical ventilator), helmet ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve, noninvasive bilevel positive-pressure ventilation, nonrebreather face masks, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), and nasal prongs. Measurements and Main Results: Invasive ventilation and helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve were associated with the lowest bacteriophage concentrations in the air, and HFNO and nasal prongs were associated with the highest concentrations. At the intubating position, bacteriophage concentrations associated with HFNO (2.66  10(4) plaque-forming units [PFU]/L of air sampled), nasal prongs (1.60  10(4) PFU/L of air sampled), nonrebreather face masks (7.87  10(2) PFU/L of air sampled), and bilevel positive airway pressure (1.91  10(2) PFU/L of air sampled) were significantly higher than those associated with invasive ventilation (P < 0.05 for each). The difference between bacteriophage concentrations associated with helmet ventilation with a PEEP valve (4.29  10(C1) PFU/L of air sampled) and bacteriophage concentrations associated with invasive ventilation was not statistically significant.

It is the major form of dementia affecting older people worldwide, impeding their normal function. Finding and testing various natural compounds to target and disrupt stable A fibrils seems to be a promising and attractive therapeutic approach. Four phenolic compounds from plant sources were taken into consideration for the present work, and were initially screened by docking. Ellagic acid (REF) came out to be the best binder of the A oligomer from docking studies. To test the destabilization effect of REF on the A oligomer, MD simulation was conducted. The simulation outcome obtained clearly indicates a drift of terminal chains from the A oligomer, leading to the disorganization of the characteristically organized cross  structure of the A fibrils. Increased values of RMSD, Rg, RMSF, and SASA are indicative of the destabilization of the A fibril in the presence of REF. The disruption of salt bridges and a notable decline in the number of hydrogen bonds and -sheet content explain the conformational changes in the A fibril structure, ceasing their neurotoxicity. The MM-PBSA results revealed the binding of REF to chain A of the A oligomer. The destabilization potential of ellagic acid, as explained by the MD simulation study, establishes it as a promising drug for curing AD.

AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1C3 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4C6 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7C8 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9C10 (7%; 95%CI: ?4 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously.

This is why many tests and indices have been developed to detect preload dependence and predict fluid responsiveness. In this review, we take stock of the data published in the field over the past three years. Regarding the passive leg raising test, we detail the different stroke volume surrogates that have recently been described to measure its effects using minimally invasive and easily accessible methods. We review the limits of the test, especially in patients with intra-abdominal hypertension. Regarding the end-expiratory occlusion test, we also present recent investigations that have sought to measure its effects without an invasive measurement of cardiac output. Although the limits of interpretation of the respiratory variation of pulse pressure and of the diameter of the vena cava during mechanical ventilation are now well known, several recent studies have shown how changes in pulse pressure variation itself during other tests reflect simultaneous changes in cardiac output, allowing these tests to be carried out without its direct measurement. This is particularly the case during the tidal volume challenge, a relatively recent test whose reliability is increasingly well established. The mini-fluid challenge has the advantage of being easy to perform, but it requires direct measurement of cardiac output, like the classic fluid challenge. Initially described with echocardiography, recent studies have investigated other means of judging its effects. We highlight the problem of their precision, which is necessary to evidence small changes in cardiac output. Finally, we point out other tests that have appeared more recently, such as the Trendelenburg manoeuvre, a potentially interesting alternative for patients in the prone position.","output":"Prediction of fluid responsiveness.

The main product processed by NLRP3 inflammasome is interleukin (IL)-1, responsible for the downstream production of IL-6, which has been recognized as an important mediator in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug with the ability to block NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization, this may prevent the release of active IL-1 and block the detrimental effects of downstream cytokines, i.e. IL-6. To date, few randomized clinical trials and many observational studies with colchicine have been conducted, showing interesting signals. As colchicine is a nonspecific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, compounds specifically blocking this molecule might provide increased advantages in reducing the inflammatory burden and its related clinical manifestations. This may occur through a selective blockade of different steps preceding NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization as well as through a reduced release of the main cytokines (IL-1 and IL-18). Since most evidence is based on observational studies, definitive conclusion cannot be drawn and additional studies are needed to confirm preliminary results and further dissect how colchicine and other NLRP3 inhibitors reduce the inflammatory burden and evaluate the timing and duration of treatment.

METHODS: This methodology study describes a population-based registry that has been enrolling consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 since Mar. 1, 2020. Most data are collected from retrospective chart review. Phone follow-up with patients at 30 days captures the World Health Organization clinical improvement scale and contextual, social and cultural variables. Phone follow-up also captures patient-reported quality of life using the Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey at 30 days, 60 days, 6 months and 12 months. Fifty participating emergency departments from 8 provinces in Canada currently enrol patients into the registry. INTERPRETATION: Data from the registry of the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network will be used to derive and validate clinical decision rules to inform clinical decision-making, describe the natural history of the disease, evaluate COVID-19 diagnostic tests and establish the real-world effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, including in populations that are excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials.

Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Most RSV infections were found between February and September. Adenovirus had multiple peaks, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring. RSV infection was associated with bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza was associated with croup; otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific. In general, children infected with influenza A, adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures.

To date, several \\"Variants of Concern\\" (VOCs) showing increased infectivity and resistance to neutralization have emerged and globally replaced the early viral strains. Here, we determined whether the four SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) maintained the dependency on IFITM proteins for efficient replication. We found that depletion of IFITM2 strongly reduces viral RNA production by all four VOCs in the human epithelial lung cancer cell line Calu-3. Silencing of IFITM1 had little effect, while knock-down of IFITM3 resulted in an intermediate phenotype. Strikingly, depletion of IFITM2 generally reduced infectious virus production by more than four orders of magnitude. In addition, an antibody directed against the N-terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells thought to represent major viral target cells in the lung. In conclusion, endogenously expressed IFITM proteins (especially IFITM2) are critical cofactors for efficient replication of genuine SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the currently dominating Delta variant. IMPORTANCERecent results showed that an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate requires endogenously expressed IFITM proteins for efficient infection. However, whether IFITMs are also important cofactors for infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that out-competed the original strains and currently dominate the pandemic remained to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of endogenous IFITM2 expression almost entirely prevents the production of infectious Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta VOC SARS-CoV-2 virions in a human lung cell line. In comparison, silencing of IFITM1 had little impact, while knock-down of IFITM3 had intermediate effects on viral replication. Finally, an antibody targeting the N-terminus of IFITM2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 VOC replication in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells.

We hypothesized that P2 implants placed at the tendon-to-bone interface would improve mechanical and histologic measures of supraspinatus healing. METHODS Forty rats underwent supraspinatus repairs with P2 implants in 1 shoulder and standard repair in the other. Rats were humanely killed at time 0 (n = 3), 2 weeks (n = 8), 4 weeks (n = 15), and 12 weeks (n = 14). Tendon-to-bone composite specimens were harvested and evaluated mechanically and histologically. RESULTS Tendon cross-sectional area was decreased in the P2 implant group at 4 weeks, percentage of relaxation was increased at 2 weeks, elastic modulus was increased at 4 weeks, and maximum load and maximum stress were both increased at 2 and 4 weeks. Histologic analysis revealed no foreign body reactions within or around the P2 implant, and healthy viable bone was visible within the P2 implant.

RESULTS: A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","output":"Modelling palliative and end-of-life resource requirements during COVID-19: implications for quality care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire world has been experiencing the outbreak of a novel infectious agent known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)1 .

The prevalence of co-infection was variable among COVID-19 patients in different studies, however, it could be up to 50% among non-survivors. Co-pathogens included bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila and Acinetobacter baumannii; Candida species and Aspergillus flavus; and viruses such as influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus.

Laboratory and imaging findings alone cannot help distinguish co-infection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Newly developed syndromic multiplex panels that incorporate SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the early detection of co-infection among COVID-19 patients. By contrast, clinicians cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection by ruling in other respiratory pathogens through old syndromic multiplex panels at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for coinfection among COVID-19 patients. Clinicians can neither rule out other co-infections caused by respiratory pathogens by diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection nor rule out COVID-19 by detection of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens.

More cases of mean reversion are found instead when analysing the unadjusted series. In particular, countries such as Belgium, France, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg and Malta display orders of integration significantly lower than 1. In addition, significant negative time trends are found in the case of Bulgaria, Croatia, Malta and Romania, and a positive one for Luxembourg.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the contemporary trends and geographic variation in ARF and ARDS-related mortality in the United States? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Center for Health Statistics' nationwide mortality data was conducted to assess the ARF and ARDS-related mortality trends from 2014 through 2018 and the geographic distribution of ARF and ARDS-related deaths in 2018 for all American residents. Piecewise linear regression was used to evaluate the trends in age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) in the overall population and various demographic subgroups of age, sex, race, urbanization, and region. RESULTS: Among 1,434,349 ARF-related deaths and 52,958 ARDS-related deaths during the study period, the AAMR was highest in older individuals (&#8805; 65 years), non-Hispanic Black people, and those living in the nonmetropolitan region. The AAMR for ARF-related deaths (per 100,000 people) increased from 74.9 (95% CI, 74.6-75.2) in 2014 to 85.6 (95% CI, 85.3-85.9) in 2018 (annual percentage change [APC], 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2-4.6]; Ptrend = .003). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARDS-related deaths was 3.2 (95% CI, 3.2-3.3) in 2014 and 3.0 (95% CI, 3.0-3.1; APC, -0.9 [95% CI, -5.4 to 3.8]; Ptrend = .56). The observed increase in rates for ARF mortality was consistent across the subgroups of age, sex, race or ethnicity, urbanization status, and geographical region (Ptrend < .05 for all). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARF (91.3 [95% CI, 90.8-91.8]) and ARDS-related mortality (3.3 [95% CI, 32.34]) in 2018 were highest in the South. INTERPRETATION: The ARF-related mortality increased at approximately 3.4% annually, and ARDS-related mortality showed a lack of decline in the last 5 years.

The supply chain industry is severely affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak and industry practitioners are focusing on minimizing the ripple effect of the disruption made to the economy. Considering the unprecedented situation, the research is motivated to analyse the ripple effect in a multi-echelon supply chain and investigate the performance at various nodes to understand the capability of the supply chain to withstand the disruptions at different levels. Using discrete event simulation, this study analyses the ripple effect in the copper industry by an agent-based simulation software anyLogistix, considering various key performance indexes (KPIs) to gauge the magnitude. From the results of the simulation, it is evident that the lack of safety stocks and multi-sourcing of copper facilitate as major causes for the disruptions. The simulation helps to understand the disruption levels and make the supply chain more resilient and robust for any future disruption. Further, the study proposes resilient project management solutions to recover from the cascading ripple effect in the copper supply chain. The scientific contribution of the research is to provide supply chain managers with simulation techniques to understand the ripple effect on the copper supply chain. It helps the stakeholders to understand the importance of project management tools to reduce the cascading ripple effect in a copper supply chain. Further, the findings of this study will support contemporary managers, supply chain allies, project managers, and stakeholders to formulate strategies for recovering from the supply chain disruptions caused due to natural disasters, pandemics such as COVID-19.","output":"Resilience strategies to recover from the cascading ripple effect in a copper supply chain through project management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the intervention effect of traditional Chinese medicine hot pressing combined with health education in adolescents with asthenopia, 92 adolescents with asthenopia admitted to the outpatient department of Guangming Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Pudong New Area from October 2019 to January 2021 were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the test group, each with 46 cases. Both received health education. The control group was given sodium hyaluronate eye drops, and the test group was given traditional Chinese medicine hot ironing technique intervention. After 2 courses of treatment, the scores of visual fatigue symptoms, clinical curative effect, and eye refractive power of the two groups were observed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 patients with SARS were analyzed. Three radiologists in consensus retrospectively assessed the frontal chest radiographs obtained at presentation and during treatment (n = 2045) for the distribution (each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones) and extent of lung parenchymal abnormality. Clinical end points included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. RESULTS Thirty-six (26.1%) patients required ICU care, and eight (5.8%) died. The patients who required ICU care and/or died had more extensive consolidation on chest radiographs obtained initially (median percentage of consolidation, 3.30%, with interquartile range [IR] of 1.70%-8.78% vs 1.70% [IR, 0%-3.30%]; P < .001) and on day 7 after fever onset (median percentage of consolidation, 15.00% [IR, 6.48%-28.73%] vs 5.00% [IR, 2.50%-7.50%]; P < .001) than did surviving patients who did not require ICU care. Patients with involvement of more than one lung zone on initial and day 7 chest radiographs were more likely to require ICU care and/or die than were those with involvement of one or fewer zones (P < .001). Patients with bilateral pneumonic changes at presentation were more likely to have an adverse outcome than were those with unilateral pneumonia (P < .001). Involvement of more than one lung zone at baseline chest radiography was an independent predictor of ICU admission and/or death (odds ratio, 3.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 9.32; P = .037) after adjustments for other significant factors (ie, patient age, and baseline neutrophil count and lactate dehydrogenase level).

The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread.

Early awareness of the pandemic, appropriate, drastic, and people-centric measures, as well as public support, are the main factors behind the success of Vietnam. In that context, it is observed that people's travel demand has bounced back and this research will examine factors driving the public's travel intention in the post-crisis (pandemic) period. The survey was conducted on the Internet using questionnaires designed in the Google platform. Data was collected from April 16 to May 31, 2020, from 154 Vietnamese participants. Research findings demonstrate 4 direct and indirect determinants of travel intention. The strongest effects come from perceived behavioral control which is influenced by subjective well-being. Perceived risk negatively correlates with Self-efficacy and subjective well-being.

Models with nonconstant population have been studied in the past only in particular cases, two of which we review and combine. Our main result shows that for simple\\"matrix epidemic models\\"introduced in [1], an explicit general formula for the reproduction number and the corresponding\\"weak stability alternative\\"still holds, under small modifications, for models with nonconstant population size, and even when the model allows for vaccination and loss of immunity. The importance of this result is clear once we note that the models of [1] include a large number of viral and bacterial models of epidemic propagation, including for example the totality of homogeneous COVID-19 models. To better understand the nature of the result, we emphasize that the models proposed in [1] and considered here are extensions of the SIR-PH model, which is essentially characterized by a phase-type distribution that models transitions between the\\"disease/infectious compartments\\". In these cases, the reproduction number and a certain Lyapunov function for the disease free equilibrium are explicitly expressible. Not surprisingly, accounting for varying demography, loss of immunity, and vaccinations lead to several challenges. One of the most important is that a varying population size leads to multiple endemic equilibrium points: this is in contrast with\\"classic models\\"which in general admit unique disease-free and endemic equilibria. As a special case of our analysis, we consider a\\"first approximation\\"(FA) of our model, which coincides with the constant-demography model often studied in the literature, and for which more explicit results are available.

The aim is to determine the prevalence of cardiovascular events at 90 days. PATIENTS AND METHODS An observational, analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted. Adult male and female patients seen in the emergency department using the 'TIA protocol' between January 2016 and December 2019 were analysed. Data were collected on clinical variables, complementary tests, treatment and cardiovascular events (stroke/TIA, acute coronary syndrome or death due to cardiovascular causes) at 90 days. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Aragon. RESULTS The TIA protocol was performed on 163 out of 591 patients diagnosed with TIA in the emergency department. Brain CT and neurosonology scans were performed in 100% and a 24-hour Holter-electrocardiogram was carried out in 52.1%; atrial fibrillation (AF) was detected in 3.6% of them. An MRI brain scan was performed in 78.4% and acute ischaemic injury was seen in diffusion sequences (DWI+) in 13.5%. The prevalence of cardiovascular events at 90 days was 4.9% (8): stroke, 3.1% (five TIAs); acute coronary syndrome, 0.6% (one); and death from cardiovascular causes, 1.2% (two). Major adverse cardiovascular events were significantly associated with a history of ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.014). Cardiovascular death was associated with a history of AF (p = 0.008), anticoagulants at discharge (p = 0.007) and no antiplatelet therapy at discharge (p = 0.012), and there was a tendency towards an association with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (p = 0.05).

This article demonstrates that differences between conservatives and liberals responses to COVID-19 are mitigated when people perceive the virus itself to have agency. We propose that conservatives are generally more sensitive to threats that are relatively high (vs. low) in agency. Consequently, we find that greater perceived agency of the coronavirus increases its perceived threat among conservatives but not liberals, and that this interaction is driven by differences in the tendency to attribute responsibility to agential entities. We also explore the effect of these malleable threat perceptions on downstream consequences related to the pandemic, including planned in-person consumption frequency.

The aim of this review was to describe the distribution, pharmacological interventions, and outcomes of delirium motor subtypes in ICU patients. METHODS This systematic scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA-ScR and Cochrane guidelines. We performed a systematic search in six major databases to identify relevant studies. A meta-regression analysis was performed where pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were computed by a random effect model. RESULTS We included 131 studies comprising 13,902 delirious patients. There was a large between-study heterogeneity among studies, including differences in study design, setting, population, and outcome reporting. Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent delirium motor subtype (50.3% [95% CI 46.0-54.7]), followed by mixed delirium (27.7% [95% CI 24.1-31.3]) and hyperactive delirium (22.7% [95% CI 19.0-26.5]). When comparing the delirium motor subtypes, patients with mixed delirium experienced the longest delirium duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, the highest ICU and hospital mortality, and more frequently received administration of specific agents (antipsychotics, 2-agonists, benzodiazepines, and propofol) during ICU stay. In studies with high average age for delirious patients (> 65 years), patients were more likely to experience hypoactive delirium. CONCLUSIONS Hypoactive delirium was the most prevalent motor subtype in critically ill patients.

Despite sustained efforts, the factors that affect PRRSV replication in host cells are far from being fully elucidated and thus warrants further investigation. In this study, we first demonstrated that PRRSV infection can cause downregulation of endogenous p21 protein in MARC-145 cells in a virus dose-dependent manner. Next, we analyzed the effect of p21 knockdown by RNA interference on cell cycle progression using flow cytometric analysis, and found that knockdown of p21 promotes MARC-145 cells entry into S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, we further discovered PRRSV infection is also able to promote MARC-145 cells entry into the S phase. Subsequently, we synchronized MARC-145 cells into G0/G1, S and G2/M phases, respectively, and then determined PRRSV replication in these cells. Results here show that the MARC-145 cells synchronized into the S phase exhibited the highest viral titer among the cells synchronized to different phases. Additionally, to reliably analyze the potential role of endogenous p21 protein in PRRSV replication, we constructed a p21 gene-knockout MARC-145 cell line (p21(?/?)) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated its capability to support PRRSV replication. Our results indicate that knockout of p21 is conducive to PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, through construction of a series of eukaryotic plasmids expressing each of individual PRRSV proteins combined with cell transfection, we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) of PRRSV mediates p21 degradation, which was further confirmed by generating a stable MARC-145 cell line constitutively expressing nsp11 using a lentivirus system. Notably, we further demonstrated that the endoribonuclease activity rather than the deubiquitinating activity of nsp11 is essential for p21 degradation via mutagenic analysis. Finally, we demonstrated that nsp11 mediates p21 degradation via a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation manner. Altogether, our study not only uncovers a new pathogenesis of PRRSV, but also provides new insights into development of novel antiviral strategies.","output":"PRRSV Promotes MARC-145 Cells Entry Into S Phase of the Cell Cycle to Facilitate Viral Replication via Degradation of p21 by nsp11"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Biochemical markers in COVID-19 remain to be defined We analyzed the usefulness of LDH and ferritin in predicting outcome","output":"Prognostic value of serum lactate dehydrogenase in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth is an expanding eld and facilitates the ability to connect with the patients, when physicalencounters are not possible However, its use in pediatric services remains limited In light of the COVID-19pandemic, telehealth is the only available option to provide continuity of care American Academy of Pediatricsalso has issued guidance in order to ensure continued care for children during this crisis We assess thefeasibility of web-based platforms and explore the challenges and barriers to telehealth implementation in asmall primary care setting Methods A video-conference using web-based applications is used for historytaking and visual examination to assess child activity in a pediatric practice serving over 400 children Weasked parents to rate their experience and degree of satisfaction Results We summarize our experienceintegrating telehealth technology into the practice of pediatrics: Limited Evaluation;Although telehealth maybe equivalent to face-to-face evaluation in many regards;it lacks the opportunity to perform a physicalexamination This is particularly concerning in examining children with medical complexities It is therefore important to pre-screen which children should be seen, in person Time Management: The visits often exceedtime allotted particularly in infants and younger children Initially it took signicant time to obtain andadequate history We started pre-brieng regarding virtual visit and what to expect Technical Challenges: Lackof familiarity with telehealth and the equipment is an important challenge, particularly in disadvantagedpopulation Physicians also facing technical issues as there was insufficient time to prepare Concern for Over-treatment: The treatment may simply be based on symptoms such as child touching the ears and attributed tootitis media;or a fever and cough may be treated as pneumonia Also, because of the ambiguity of thesituation, many parents may simply prefer to obtain a prescription for an antibiotic, or other medications Threat to Privacy: This issue is more relevant to the adolescent We believe adolescents would be betterserved, if they were permitted to use their personal cell phone Reimbursement: An inadequatereimbursement is a most important issue For sustainability, a sincere effort is needed to establish adequatepayment mechanism for telehealth services Liability Issues: Since telehealth mediated medical care is limitedregarding a physical examination, physicians are anxious whether they are missing certain importantdiagnosis This raises a concern for medicolegal liability There is a need to set clear guidelines for liabilityprotections Conclusion Although telehealth is widely accepted by the parents, it is important to understandthe limitations of telehealth The nature of such limitations should be conveyed to parents Since the health ofchildren cannot wait for a normalization of health care delivery;we need to be able to modify, adapt and try todo what is feasible","output":"Virtual visits during COVID-19 pandemic;a pediatrician'sperspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The embryonated egg is a complex structure comprising an embryo and its supporting membranes (chorioallantoic, amniotic, yolk).

Influenza B/1/86 was by far the most prevalent pathogen but other viruses including influenza A, paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC-43 were also present, either alone or in combination during the sampling period.

On the basis of its ability to modulate autophagy, trehalose has been considered an innovative drug for ameliorating many diseases, but its molecular mechanism is not well described. Previous findings demonstrated that trehalose plays a photoprotective role against ultraviolet (UV) B-induced damage through autophagy induction in keratinocytes. In this study, coimmunoprecipitation, label-free quantitative proteomic and parallel reaction monitoring, and western blot analysis demonstrated that trehalose promotes the interaction between tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 3 and Beclin1. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining analysis suggested that trehalose increases ATG9A localization in lysosomes and decreases its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, in the presence or absence of UVB radiation, we evaluated the influence of TIMP3 and ATG9A small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the effect of trehalose on autophagy, cell death, migration, or interleukin-8 expression in keratinocytes, including HaCaT, A431, and human epidermal keratinocytes. The results revealed that in HaCaT cells, TIMP3 and ATG9A siRNA resulted in attenuation of trehalose-induced autophagy and inhibited cell death. In A431 cells, TIMP3 and ATG9A siRNA led to attenuation of trehalose-induced autophagy and cell death and inhibited migration. In human epidermal keratinocytes, trehalose-induced autophagy and inhibition of the interleukin-8 expression were blocked by ATG9A but not TIMP3 siRNA. In addition, the results of quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated the abnormal expression of TIMP3 and ATG9A in actinic keratosis and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma skin tissues. These findings suggest the protective effects of trehalose in normal keratinocytes and its inhibitory effects on cancerous keratinocytes, possibly mediated by activation of autophagy and regulation of TIMP3 and ATG9A, providing the mechanistic basis for the potential use of trehalose in the prevention or treatment of UVB-induced skin diseases.","output":"Trehalose Protects Keratinocytes against Ultraviolet B Radiation by Activating Autophagy via Regulating TIMP3 and ATG9A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim Coral reefs shift between distinct communities with depth throughout the world Yet, despite over half a century of research on coral reef depth gradients, researchers have not addressed the driving force of these patterns We present a theoretical, process-based model of light?s influence on the shallow to mesophotic reef transition as a single quantitative framework We also share an interactive web application Moving beyond depth as an ecological proxy will enhance research conducted on deeper coral reefs Location Global;subtropical and tropical coral reefs, oligotrophic and turbid coastal waters Time period Present day (2020) Major taxa Scleractinia Methods We constructed ordinary differential equations representing the preferred light environments of shallow and mesophotic Scleractinia We projected these as depth bands using light attenuation coefficients from around the world, and performed a sensitivity analysis Results We found light relationships alone are sufficient to capture major ecological features across coral reef depth gradients Our model supports the depth limits currently used in coral reef ecology, predicting a global range for the shallow-upper mesophotic boundary at 36 1 m  5 6 and the upper-lower mesophotic boundary at 61 9 m  9 6 However, our model allows researchers to move past these fixed depth limits, and quantitatively predict the depths of reef zones in locations around the world Main conclusions The use of depth as a proxy for changes in coral reef communities offers no guidance for environmental variation between sites We have shown it is possible to use light to predict the depth boundaries of reef zones as a continuous variable, and to accommodate this variability Predicting the depths of reef zones in unusual light environments suggests that shallow-water turbid reefs should be considered as mesophotic coral ecosystems Nonetheless, the current depth-based heuristics are relatively accurate at a global level","output":"A generalized light-driven model of community transitions along coral reef depth gradients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives.

Potentially infectious culture supernatant or mouse oral lavage samples were treated with ethanol or Trizol to 75% (v/v) for attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy, or RT-PCR, respectively. The control condition, UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 elicited strong biochemical changes in culture supernatant/oral lavage despite lack of replication determined by RT-PCR or cell culture infectious dose 50%. Crucially, we show that active SARS-CoV-2 infection induced additional FTIR signals over the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 infection, which correspond to innate immune response, aggregated proteins, and RNA.

SILS offers several patient-related benefits over multiport laparoscopy. However, its use in obese patients has been limited from concerns of technical difficulty, oncologic compromise, and higher complication and conversion rates. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of SILS for colectomy in obese patients. METHODS Review of a prospective database identified patients undergoing elective colectomy using SILS from 2009 to 2014. They were stratified into obese (BMI  30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese cohorts (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) and then matched on patient characteristics, diagnosis, and operative procedure. Demographic and perioperative outcome data were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were operative time, length of stay (LOS), and conversion, complication, and readmission rates for each cohort. RESULTS A total of 160 patients were evaluated-80 in each cohort. Patients were well matched in demographics, diagnosis, and procedure variables. The obese cohort had significantly higher BMI (p < 0.001) and ASA scores (p = 0.035). Operative time (176.9  64.0 vs. 144.4  47.2 min, p < 0.001) and estimated blood loss (89.0  139.5 vs. 51.6  38.0 ml, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the obese. There were no significant differences in conversion rates (p = 0.682), final incision length (p = 0.088), LOS (p = 0.332), postoperative complications (p = 0.430), or readmissions (p = 1.000) in the obese versus non-obese. Further, in malignant cases, lymph nodes harvested (p = 0.757) and negative distal margins (p = 1.000) were comparable across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy in obese patients had significantly longer operative times, but comparable conversion rates, oncologic outcomes, lengths of stay, complication, and readmission rates as the non-obese cohorts. In the obese, where higher morbidity rates are typically associated with surgical outcomes, SILS may be the ideal platform to optimize outcomes in colorectal surgery. With additional operative time, the obese can realize the same clinical and quality benefits of minimally invasive surgery as the non-obese.","output":"Outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy surgery in obese patients: a case-matched study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has changed over the last 20 years.

One area that has been particularly poorly studied is that of the role of caregivers in the health of veterans with PTE and the impact caring for someone with PTE has on the caregivers themselves. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to address the following: describe and compare the health and quality of life of veterans and caregivers of veterans with and without PTE; evaluate the change in available supports and unmet needs for services among caregivers of post-9/11 veterans with PTE over a 2-year period and to compare support and unmet needs with those without PTE; and identify veteran and caregiver characteristics associated with the 2-year health trajectories of caregivers and veterans with PTE compared with veterans without PTE. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of the health and quality of life among 4 groups of veterans and their caregivers: veterans with PTE, nontraumatic epilepsy, TBI only, and neither epilepsy nor TBI. We will recruit participants from previous related studies and collect information about both the veterans and their primary informal caregivers on health, quality of life, unmet needs for care, PTE and TBI symptoms and treatment, relationship, and caregiver experience. Data sources will include existing data supplemented with primary data, such as survey data collected at baseline, intermittent brief reporting using ecological momentary assessment, and qualitative interviews. We will make both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons, using veteran-caregiver dyads, along with qualitative findings to better understand risk and promotive factors for quality of life and health among veterans and caregivers, as well as the bidirectional impact of caregivers and care recipients on one another.

PURPOSE: To examine the vaccine-related beliefs and behaviors associated with likely hesitancy toward vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nonelderly adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination.

Since this factor is unobservable, it is difficult to agree on what it represents. We argue that the latent factor that emerges from the two different empirical approaches used might have a composite nature, being the result of both the more general convergence of the economic cycles of the countries in the area and the increasingly better tuned tax structure. However, the original aspect of our paper is the use of a back-propagation neural networks (BPNN)-DF model to test the results of the time-series.

Currently, although attenuated vaccines are commonly used in commercial pig farms in China, they do not completely protect against all mutated wild-type strains. Existing nucleic acid assays have high sensitivity and specificity, but the complexity of the assay process and expensive instrumentation hinder disease detection. Here, reverse transcriptionCenzymatic recombinase amplification (RT-ERA) was combined with the CRISPR-Cas12a system to develop a rapid diagnostic method to distinguish PEDV wild-type strains from attenuated vaccine strains. The protocol used crRNA and RT-ERA amplification primers against open reading frame 3 (ORF3), followed by Cas12a/crRNA complex detection of predefined target sequences at 37 C for 30 min, thus producing results visible to the naked eye under LED blue light. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, detecting as few as two copies of the target gene per test and showing no cross-reactivity with other porcine pathogens. Overall, this integrated RT-ERA pre-amplification and Cas12a/crRNA cleavage assay is a practical tool for reliable and rapid detection of PEDV for diagnostic differentiation.

The theoretical postoperative refractions were calculated using the Kane and the Pearl-DGS methods and a vergence based formula (Barrett Universal II, BUII). The differences between the manifest and objective postoperative refractions and the predicted refractions were calculated. The percentage of eyes within 0.5 D and 1.0 D prediction error (PE), the mean, and the median absolute errors (MAE and MedAE) were also determined. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 69.48 years; the axial length was between 21.19 and 25.39 mm. The number of eyes within 0.5/1.0 D PE was 96/108 (84.21%/94.73%) using the Hill-RBF 2.0 method, 92/107 (80.70%/93.85%) with the Kane method, 91/107 (79.82%/93.85%) with the Pearl-DGS method, and 91/106 (79.82%/92.98%) with the BUII formula, using subjective refraction. With objective refractometric data, PEs were within 0.5 D in 88 (77.19%), 83 (72.80%), 82 (71.92%), and 80 (70.17%) cases (Hill-RBF, Kane, Pearl-DGS, BUII, respectively).

However, cotton fiber yield and quality are highly influenced by salt stress. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cotton in response to salinity stress is importance to breed new cultivars with high tolerance. In this study, we first developed a method for single-cell RNA-seq based on isolating protoplast from cotton root tips; then, we studied the impact of salinity stress on gene expression profiling and their dynamic changes using the developed high-efficiency method for protoplast dissociation suitable for single-cell RNA-seq. A total of 3391 and 2826 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in salt-treated samples before and after protoplast dissociation, respectively, which were enriched into several molecular components, including response to stimulus, response to stress, and cellular macromolecule metabolic process by gene ontology (GO) analysis. Plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and MAPK signaling pathway were found to be enriched via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Twenty-two and nine salinity-responsive DEGs participated in plant hormone signaling and MAPK signaling in roots, before and after protoplast dissociation, respectively; six upregulated DEGs were involved in ABA signaling transduction, namely, Ga04G2111, Ga07G0142, Ga09G2061, Ga10G0262, Ga01G0063, and Ga08G1915 which indicates their potential functions on plants adapting to salt stress. Additionally, 384 and 257 transcription factors (TFs) were differentially expressed in salt-stress roots before and after protoplast dissociation, respectively, of which significantly up-regulated TFs mainly belonged to the AP2/ERF-ERF family, which implied their potential roles responding to salt stress. These results not only provide novel insights to reveal the regulatory networks in plant's root response to salt stress, but also lay the solid foundation for further exploration on cellular heterogeneity by single-cell transcriptome sequencing.","output":"Protoplast Dissociation and Transcriptome Analysis Provides Insights to Salt Stress Response in Cotton"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic spread on networks is one of the most studied dynamics in network science and has important implications in real epidemic scenarios.

The model assumes that inside a city the infection channels connect many different locations, while the infection channels between cities are less and usually directly connect only a few nearest neighbor cities in a two-dimensional plane. We find that the model experience two epidemic transitions. The first lower threshold represents a local epidemic spread within a city but not to the entire country and the second higher threshold represents a global epidemic in the entire country.

The current pandemic has increased pressure on healthcare systems around the world, leading to medical professionals using high-grade PPE for prolonged durations, resulting in device-induced skin injuries. This study focuses on computationally improving the interaction between skin and PPE to reduce the likelihood of discomfort and tissue damage. A finite element model is developed to simulate the movement of PPE against the face during day-to-day tasks. Due to limited available data on skin characteristics and how these vary interpersonally between sexes, races and ages, the main objective of this study was to establish the effects and trends that mask modifications have on the resulting subsurface strain energy density distribution in the skin. These modifications include the material, geometric and interfacial properties. Overall, the results show that skin injury can be reduced by using softer mask materials, whilst friction against the skin should be minimised, e.g. through use of micro-textures, humidity control and topical creams. Furthermore, the contact area between the mask and skin should be maximised, whilst the use of soft materials with incompressible behaviour (e.g. many elastomers) should be avoided.","output":"A numerical analysis of skinCPPE interaction to prevent facial tissue injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the implementation of the preschool oral healthcare programme (POHP) for 5C6-year-old children over the past 3 decades in Malaysia, dental plaque and caries levels in this age group remain high. Among the child-level attributable factors are unhealthy self-care behaviours (poor oral hygiene and high sugary diet). In order to improve the childrens oral health, an improved programme called the Senyuman Indah Milik Semua Programme (SIMSP) or Beautiful Smile for All programme is introduced. In this programme, a triad of dental hygienist-teacher-parent works together to improve childrens oral hygiene levels compared with the existing POHP that involves dental hygienists only. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the SIMSP versus the existing POHP on oral hygiene levels of 5C6-year-old children in the Kampar district, Perak state, Malaysia. METHODS: This study is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, parallel-group, matched pair, controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Randomisation is performed using a computer-generated table with a 1:1 allocation comparing the SIMSP and the POHP involving 28 preschools in the Kampar district, Perak, Malaysia. The intervention consists of preschool visits by a group of dental therapists, in-class oral health lessons and daily toothbrushing conducted by class teacher, child home toothbrushing supervised by parents, and infographic oral health messages to parents. The control consists of the existing POHP that involves preschool visits by a group of dental therapists only. The trial lasts for 6 months. Primary outcome variable is the mean plaque score change after 6 months. To determine the feasibility of the SIMSP, a process evaluation will be conducted using the perspectives of dental therapists, teachers, and parents on the appropriateness, effectiveness, facilitators, and barriers to the SIMSP implementation as well as an audit trail to assess the trial intervention. DISCUSSION: Cluster randomisation may lead to a random effect and cluster selection bias. These factors will be accounted for when analysing the data and interpreting the outcomes. The effectiveness of the SIMSP will be evaluated by comparing the results with those of the POHP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04339647.

Patient subgroups for which CS could be more beneficial also need appraisal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of early CS in COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU on the occurrence of 60-day mortality, ICU-acquired-bloodstream infections(ICU-BSI), and hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia(HAP-VAP). METHODS: We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to 11 ICUs belonging to the French OutcomeRea(TM) network from January to May 2020. We used survival models with ponderation with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: The study population comprised 303 patients having a median age of 61.6 (53C70) years of whom 78.8% were male and 58.6% had at least one comorbidity. The median SAPS II was 33 (25C44). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 34.8% of the patients. Sixty-six (21.8%) patients were in the Early-C subgroup. Overall, 60-day mortality was 29.4%. The risks of 60-day mortality ((IPTW)HR = 0.86;95% CI 0.54 to 1.35, p = 0.51), ICU-BSI and HAP-VAP were similar in the two groups. Importantly, early CS treatment was associated with a lower mortality rate in patients aged 60 years or more ((IPTW)HR, 0.53;95% CI, 0.3C0.93; p = 0.03). In contrast, CS was associated with an increased risk of death in patients younger than 60 years without inflammation on admission ((IPTW)HR = 5.01;95% CI, 1.05, 23.88; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, early CS treatment was not associated with patient survival.

There is little data on the magnesium status of patients with Covid-19 with different degrees of severity. This study was conducted to evaluate prevalence of dysmagnesemia in a prospective Covid-19 cohort study according to the severity of the clinical manifestations and to identify factors associated. Serum magnesium was measured in 300 of 549 patients admitted to the hospital due to severe Covid-19. According to the WHO guidelines, patients were classified as moderate, severe, or critical. 48% patients had a magnesemia below 0.75 mmol/L (defined as magnesium deficiency) including 13% with a marked hypomagnesemia (<0.65 mmol/L). 9.6% had values equal to or higher than 0.95 mmol/L. Serum magnesium concentrations were significantly lower in female than in male (0.73  0.12 vs 0.80  0.13 mmol/L), whereas the sex ratio M/F was higher in severe and critical form (p<0.001).

These environmental and socio-political stressors have been accompanied by the spread of problematic psychological and behavioural tendencies, such as the growing polarisation of opinions and values, online radicalisation and extremism, deepening xenophobia and nationalism, the proliferation of irrational beliefs and conspiracy theories, and resistance to rational public policy measures. Here we argue that although they fall outside the scope of psychopathology, they nevertheless currently constitute a major challenge for psychiatry as a research domain and a clinical practise. To substantiate this claim, we outline the mechanisms by which media-transmitted stressors impact mental well-being and possibly psychopathology. The common denominator of these global problems and the media's construction of reality is the increase in uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability, which prompts defensive responding and, in predisposed individuals, functions as a potent source of chronic stress. These contribute to cognitive inflexibility, a strong predisposing factor for the development of rigid beliefs and attitudes, which to varying degrees underlie the adverse psychological and behavioural tendencies mentioned above. We suggest that the tightening of beliefs and ideas that is the result of cognitive rigidity may correspond to the clinical characteristics of induced delusional disorder. This can be seen as a (ultimately maladaptive) defensive strategy for coping with a high degree of uncertainty and unpredictability.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical role played by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective study, the parameters of liver function tests in COVID-19 inpatients were compared between various time-points in reference to SARS-CoV-2 shedding, and 3 to 7 days before the first detection of viral shedding was regarded as the reference baseline. RESULTS: In total, 70 COVID-19 inpatients were enrolled. Twenty-two (31.4%) patients had a self-medication history after illness. At baseline, 10 (14.3%), 7 (10%), 9 (12.9%), 2 (2.9%), 15 (21.4%), and 4 (5.7%) patients already had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, and total bilirubin (TBIL) values, respectively. ALT and AST abnormal rates and levels did not show any significant dynamic changes during the full period of viral shedding (all p > 0.05). The GGT abnormal rate (p = 0.008) and level (p = 0.033) significantly increased on day 10 of viral shedding. Meanwhile, no simultaneous significant increases in abnormal ALP rates and levels were observed. TBIL abnormal rates and levels significantly increased on days 1 and 5 of viral shedding (all p < 0.05). Albumin abnormal decrease rates increased, and levels decreased consistently from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 clearance day (all p < 0.05). Thirteen (18.6%) patients had chronic liver disease, two of whom died. The ALT and AST abnormal rates and levels did not increase in patients with chronic liver disease during SARS-CoV-2 shedding.

A myriad of other causes have been associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), most notably systemic inflammatory conditions; especially Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis and hematolymphoid malignancies particularly T/NK-cell lymphomas. METHODS/CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 7-year-old boy, presented to the ER with fever and a skin rash over both lower limbs of 1 week duration. Two weeks prior he was tested for COVID-19 and was found to be positive. Physical examination further revealed slightly palpable liver and spleen. CBC was done and exhibited pancytopenia, further testing showed elevated LDH, hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. However, serological testing for rheumatological conditions was unremarkable. Imaging studies were done and were noncontributory. Subsequently, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were done. The bone marrow aspirate showed afew histiocytes engulfing red blood cells and nuclear debris (hemophagocytic cells), complete trilineage maturation and normal M:E ratio of 3:1. Trephine biopsy was hypocellular for age and estimated at about 70%, composed of myeloid and erythroid precursors with various degrees of maturation.

ABSTRACT: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) affects few children previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, 45 children admitted to our hospital for MIS-C underwent genetic screening with a commercial 109-immune-gene panel. Thirty-nine children were diagnosed with MIS-C, and 25.4% of the 39 MIS-C patients harbored rare heterozygous missense mutations either in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) genes (LYST, STXBP2, PRF1, UNC13D, AP3B1) or the HLH-associated gene DOCK8 (four variants). We demonstrate that foamy virus introduction of cDNA for the four DOCK8 variants into human NK-92 natural killer (NK) cells led to decreased CD107a expression (degranulation) and decreased NK cell lytic function in vitro for each variant. Heterozygous carriers of missense mutations in pHLH genes and DOCK8 may serve as risk factors for development of MIS-C among children previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Gene Variants in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our tertiary level centre, the oral and maxillofacial (OMFS) rotas often change at short- notice due to service requirements and the development of guidance relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mechanisms by which these causes act on bumble bee colonies are, however, likely to be complex and to involve many levels of organization spanning from the community down to the least understood individual level. Here, we assessed how the morphology, weight and foraging behavior of individual workers are affected by their surrounding landscape. We hypothesized that colonies established in landscapes showing high cover of intensive crops and low cover of flowering crops, as well as low amounts of local floral resources, would produce smaller workers, which would perform fewer foraging trips and collect pollen loads less constant in species composition. We tested these predictions with 80 colonies of commercially reared Bombus impatiens Cresson placed in 20 landscapes spanning a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Qubec, Canada. We estimated weekly rate at which workers entered and exited colonies and captured eight workers per colony over a period of 14 weeks during the spring and summer of 2016. Captured workers had their wing, thorax, head, tibia, and dry weight measured, as well as their pollen load extracted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. We did not detect any effect of landscape habitat composition on worker morphology or body weight, but found that foraging activity decreased with intensive crops. Moreover, higher diversity of local floral resources led to lower pollen constancy in intensively cultivated landscapes. Finally, we found a negative correlation between the size of workers and the diversity of their pollen load. Our results provide additional evidence that conservation actions regarding pollinators in arable landscapes should be made at the landscape rather than at the farm level.","output":"Landscape composition and local floral resources influence foraging behavior but not the size of Bombus impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pseuodotyped particles have significant importance and use in virology as tools for studying the biology of highly pathogenic viruses in a lower biosafety environment.

While MMLV pseudotyped the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) efficiently, it could not pseudotype the full-length SPG. In contrast, pLV pseudotyped both glycoproteins efficiently; however, much higher titers of pLV-G particles were produced. Among all the tested mammalian cells, 293Ts expressing hACE2 were most efficiently transduced using the pLV-S system. The pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by diluted serum (>:640) from recently recovered COVID-19 patients who showed high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG levels. In summary, pLV-S pseudotyped virus provides a valid screening tool for the presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent patient serum.","output":"Effective screening of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patient serum using lentivirus particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An important quality marker for end-of-life services is congruence with patients preferred place of care, but this congruence in place of care is less likely for those facing structural inequalities (Grunier et al., 2007).

As a direct consequence of Covid-19 and the physical closure of schools we can now identify three specific content-producing cultures emerging within the educational community (Marcus-Quinn, A., T. Hourigan, and S. McCoy. 2019a. The Digital Learning Movement: How Should Schools Respond?. Economic and Social Review 50 (4): 767C783). On the top tier we can see the independently developed resources by private educational companies that have been designed with accessibility hardwired into the resources. Such accessibility caters to the widest range of user needs. The second tier provides digital materials that have been produced by teachers in schools that have a tech-driven agenda;such schools do not make it mandatory for teachers or students to use privately produced books. The third tier comprises teachers, outside of a formal community of practice, who use privately produced resources but modify them to suit their student needs better. There has been a rapid migration to digital learning as a direct response to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in schools (Mohan, G., S. McCoy, E. Carroll, G. Mihut, S. Lyons, and C. Mac Domhnaill. 2020. Learning for all? Second-level education in Ireland during COVID-19. ESRI Survey and Statistical Report Series 92 June 2020.). As schools have scrambled to adapt to this ever-changing environment, digital inclusion has never been more critical as school communities now navigate these new learning experiences (Hall, Byrne et al. 2021;Marcus-Quinn, A., and T. Hourigan. 2021. Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open: Policy and Practice. Cham: Springer.;Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021a.

The Naace Journal 89: 17C23). To comply with European legislation passed in 2019, public sector organisations and private companies and organisations need to check the accessibility of their websites, mobile apps, and media content (Oncins, E., and P. Orero. 2021. Let's put Standardisation in Practice: Accessibility Services and Interaction. Hikma 20 (1): 71C90. https://www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/Planning/Digital-Learning-Framework-and-Planning-Resources-Post-Primary/Digital-Learning-Framework-for-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf). The educational publishing sector should also adhere to these common accessibility standards ensuring that digital content conforms to digital equity, diversity, and inclusion principles (Mihut, G., S. McCoy, and B. Ma?tre. 2021. A Capability Approach to Understanding Academic and Socio-emotional Outcomes of Students with Special Educational Needs in Ireland. Oxford Review of Education.). During the Covid-19 pandemic it became clear that there is an appetite for high-quality open-access digital teaching and learning materials (Eivers, E., J. Worth, and A. Ghosh. 2020. Home Learning During COVID-19: Findings from the Understanding Society Longitudinal Study. Slough: National Foundation for Educational Research.). To improve the consistency and reusability of such resources the education community would benefit from easy access to shared quality templates that are professionally designed and usability tested. Such an initiative is unlikely to happen without buy-in from publishers in conjunction with the Department of Education. Such collaboration was behind the successful establishment of Scoilnet: Irelands national repository for shared digital teachi g and learning materials. During the pandemic Scoilnet compiled a list to highlight the Open-access resources available to stakeholders and requested that teachers make recommendations and upload such resources to the Scoilnet portal. It is clear that such resources need to be designed and developed, and this requires professional time and resources. We cannot expect this to happen without cost.","output":"Digital inclusion and accessibility considerations in digital teaching and learning materials for the second-level classroom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disrupted and undermined primary care delivery. The goal of this study was to examine the financial impacts the pandemic has had on primary care clinicians and practices. METHODS: The American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network and the Robert Graham Center distributed weekly surveys from March 27, 2020, through June 15, 2020, to a network of more than 1960 physicians. Responses to the question, \\"Could you please tell us about any financial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on your practice, if any?\\" were analyzed using a grounded theory approach of qualitative analysis. The number of unique respondents who answered the financial impact question totaled 461 over the 12 weeks. RESULTS: Severe declines in patient visits, causing drastic revenue reductions, greatly impacted the ability to serve patients. Primary care clinicians and practices experienced significant changes in several areas about financial implications: patient visits, financial strain, staffing and telehealth. DISCUSSION: Preliminary findings revealed that even with Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as CARES Act, funding, business viability remains questionable for some primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS: Low patient visits directly resulted in decreased revenues, which in turn, impacted staffing decisions and fueled telehealth implementation. It is difficult to predict whether patient visits will increase after June. Alternate payment models could provide some financial stability and address business viability.","output":"COVID-19's Financial Impact on Primary Care Clinicians and Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genotypes or serotypes along with the poor cross-protection observed among IBV serotypes have complicated the avian infectious bronchitis (IB) control programs in different geographic regions.

Reduced pulsatility attenuation over the internal carotid artery (ICA) could be a contributing factor to the development of cSVD and could be associated with intracranial ICA calcification (iICAC). PURPOSE: To compare pulsatility, pulsatility attenuation, and distensibility along the ICA between patients with cSVD and controls and to assess the association between iICAC and pulsatility and distensibility. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective, explorative cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: A total of 17 patients with cSVD, manifested as lacunar infarcts or deep intracerebral hemorrhage, and 17 age- and sex-matched controls. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted gradient echo imaging and 4D phase-contrast (PC) MRI with a 3D time-resolved velocity encoded gradient echo sequence at 7 T. ASSESSMENT: Blood-flow velocity pulsatility index (vPI) and arterial distensibility were calculated for seven ICA segments (C1-C7). iICAC presence and volume were determined from available brain CT scans (acquired as part of standard clinical care) in patients with cSVD. STATISTICAL TESTS: Independent t-tests and linear mixed models. The threshold for statistically significance was P < 0.05 (two tailed). RESULTS: The cSVD group showed significantly higher ICA vPI and significantly lower distensibility compared to controls. Controls showed significant attenuation of vPI over the carotid siphon (-4.9%  3.6%). In contrast, patients with cSVD showed no attenuation, but a significant increase of vPI (+6.5%  3.1%). iICAC presence and volume correlated positively with vPI (r = 0.578) in patients with cSVD and negatively with distensibility (r = -0.386). CONCLUSION: Decreased distensibility and reduced pulsatility attenuation are associated with increased iICAC and may contribute to cSVD. Confirmation in a larger prospective study is required.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPPE on ERCP success parameters compared to standard PPE (SPPE). METHODS: ERCP procedures were evaluated retrospectively and ERCP outcomes were compared for similar time periods as before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were cannulation time, number of cannulation attempts, cannulation success rate, difficult cannulation rate, undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rate, ERCP-related adverse events, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty ERCP procedures were examined. One hundred and fifty-nine procedures were excluded due to missing data, previous sphincterotomy or altered anatomy. Of the final eligible sample size of 221 ERCPs, 93 were performed using SPPE and 128 were performed under EPPE. Indications of ERCP and demographic parameters were similar between groups. The majority of the ERCP cases included were for benign biliary obstruction of common bile duct stones (88.7%). No significant differences were detected in overall technical success (91.4% vs 92.2%, p = 0.832), cannulation success rates (94.6% vs 96.8%, p = 0.403), cannulation times (median times of both groups were 3 min, p = 0.824), difficult cannulation rates (37.6% vs 33.6%, p = 0.523), undesired pancreatic duct cannulation rates (29% vs 22.7%, p = 0.593), number of cannulation attempts (2.80 vs 2.71, p = 0.731), ERCP-related adverse events (9.7% vs 10.9%, p = 0.762), and length of hospital stay (6.63 vs 6.92 days, p = 0.768) between SPPE and EPPE groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Biliary obstructions of common bile duct stones were the major indication of ERCP in the current study. The use of EPPE had no negative effects on ERCP performance in this patient group.

The impact that community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 has in the neonatal time period is unclear, as this population has unique immunity considerations. OBJECTIVE: To report on a case series of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates through community acquisition in the USA. DESIGN: This is an early retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) identified as having SAR-CoV-2 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. FINDINGS: Three patients who required admission to the NICU between the ages of 17 and 33 days old were identified. All 3 had ill contacts in the home or had been to the pediatrician and presented with mild to moderate symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, and hypoxia, requiring supplemental oxygen during their hospital stay. One patient was admitted with neutropenia, and the other 2 patients became neutropenic during hospitalization. None of the patients had meningitis or multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 may require hospitalization due to rule-out sepsis guidelines if found to have fever and/or hypoxia.

Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the ASM/ceramide system may be central to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA use among patients hospitalized for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an observational multicenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 2,846 adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 277 (9.7%) were taking an FIASMA medication at the time of their hospital admission. The primary end point was a composite of intubation and/or death. We compared this end point between patients taking vs. not taking an FIASMA medication in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 days (SD = 12.5), the primary end point occurred in 104 patients (37.5%) receiving an FIASMA medication, and 1,060 patients (41.4%) who did not. Despite being significantly and substantially associated with older age and greater medical severity, FIASMA medication use was significantly associated with reduced likelihood of intubation or death in both crude (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-0.87, P < 0.001) and primary IPW (HR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.46-0.72, P < 0.001) analyses.

This framework includes the following main components: Epidemiological dynamic model describing evolution of the number of Susceptible, Infected, Recovered and Death cases with social distancing,Dynamical model describing dependence between financial indicators and growth of the pandemic in different geographical areas,Conditional stress scenario generation and financial portfolio analysis. We apply an extended epidemiological model to analysis of Covid-19 pandemic spread and analyze its impact on some of the main financial indicators, including stock indices, credit spreads and FX rates, and characteristics of the pandemic process in different geographical areas. This analysis results in a model connecting the dynamics of the pandemic and that of the main financial indicators. The model allows one to generate pandemic scenarios under different assumptions on the parameters of the infectious disease and that of the social distancing policies. Once the pandemic scenarios are generated, one can transform them into a set of scenarios on macro-economic risk factors. Then, applying the conditional scenario technique we obtain a set of Monte Carlo scenarios on the risk factors driving the portfolio dynamics. The proposed dynamic models allow one to generate various financial stress scenarios on market indicators and compute the distribution of financial portfolio losses and their risk measures. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Analysis of Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Financial Markets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, SARS, MERS, etc., have seriously endangered human safety, economy, and education. During the spread of epidemics, restricting the range of activities of personnel is one of the options for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. A global navigation satellite system (GNSS), it can provide accurate coordinates of latitude and longitude to targets with GNSS receivers. However, it is not common to use GNSS coordinates to represent positions in social life. For epidemic management, it is important to know the locations (and addresses) of targets, especially in social life. When there are many targets, it is not easy to efficiently map these coordinates to locations. Therefore, we propose a GNSS-based crowd-sensing strategy for specific geographical areas that can be used to calculate how many targets are in specific geographical areas or whether a target is in a specific area. This strategy is based on the coordinates of latitude and longitude provided by GNSS to find the locations of these coordinates. As simulated data, the data records containing latitude and longitude in a well-known social networking service platform are used.

DESIGN Qualitative comparative case study design of nurse staffing systems in England and Wales. METHODS Data will be collected through a variety of sources: individual interviews, observations of relevant meetings and analysis of key documents. Ethical approval for the study was granted in August 2020 from The Healthcare Research Ethics Committee (SREC reference: REC741). Data generation will be informed by science and technology studies and practice theories. DISCUSSION Ensuring adequate numbers of nurses are available to care for patients in response to shifting demand is an international policy priority. Emerging evidence on the use of formal workforce planning methodologies across the developed world highlights both the centrality of nurses' professional judgement in nurse staffing methodologies and the urgent need for theoretically informed research to better understand and conceptualise its contribution to decision-making. This study is designed to address this gap in understanding. It takes advantage of nurses' experiences of managing the service and staffing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and differences in strategic approaches to nurse staffing systems between England and Wales. IMPACT The research will: make visible the knowledge and skills that underpin professional judgement in nurse staffing decisions and provide a conceptual language with which to articulate this; lay the foundations for evidence-based programmes of nurse education and continuing professional development; furnish the evidence to inform the development of nurse-led decision support tools to augment professional judgement; and generate wider insights into the effectiveness of nurse staffing systems in practice.","output":"Pro-judge study: Nurses' professional judgement in nurse staffing systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An iterated uniform finite-state transducer ([Formula: see text]) operates the same length-preserving transduction, starting with a sweep on the input string and then iteratively sweeping on the output of the previous sweep.

Asymptomatic breakthrough infections have been a major problem during the ongoing surge of Delta variant globally. Serological discrimination of vaccine response from infection has so far been limited to Spike protein vaccines used in the higher-income regions. Here, we show for the first time how statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches can discriminate SARS-CoV-2 infection from immune response to an inactivated whole virion vaccine (BBV152, Covaxin, India), thereby permitting real-world vaccine effectiveness assessments from cohort-based serosurveys in Asia and Africa where such vaccines are commonly used. Briefly, we accessed serial data on Anti-S and Anti-NC antibody concentration values, along with age, sex, number of doses, and number of days since the last vaccine dose for 1823 Covaxin recipients. An ensemble ML model, incorporating a consensus clustering approach alongside the support vector machine (SVM) model, was built on 1063 samples where reliable qualifying data existed, and then applied to the entire dataset. Of 1448 self-reported negative subjects, 724 were classified as infected. Since the vaccine contains wild-type virus and the antibodies induced will neutralize wild type much better than Delta variant, we determined the relative ability of a random subset of such samples to neutralize Delta versus wild type strain. In 100 of 156 samples, where ML prediction differed from self-reported uninfected status, Delta variant, was neutralized more effectively than the wild type, which cannot happen without infection. The fraction rose to 71.8% (28 of 39) in subjects predicted to be infected during the surge, which is concordant with the percentage of sequences classified as Delta (75.6%-80.2%) over the same period.","output":"A machine learning-based approach to determine infection status in recipients of BBV152 whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for serological surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma hyorhinis infects pigs causing polyserositis and polyarthritis, and has also been reported in a variety of human tumor tissues. The occurrence of disease is often linked with the systemic invasion of the pathogen. Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), one of the key enzymes of glycolysis, was reported as a surface multifunctional molecule in several bacteria. Here, we investigated whether GAPDH could manifest binary functions; as an adhesin to promote colonization as well as a plasminogen receptor functioning in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation to promote systemic invasion. The surface localization of GAPDH was observed in M. hyorhinis with flow cytometry and colony blot analysis. Recombinant GAPDH (rGAPDH) was found to be able to bind porcine-derived PK-15 and human-derived NCI-H292 cells. The incubation with anti-GAPDH antibody significantly decreased the adherence of M. hyorhinis to both cell lines. To investigate its function in recruiting plasminogen, firstly, the interaction between rGAPDH and plasminogen was demonstrated by ELISA and Far-Western blot assay. The activation of the rGAPDH-bound plasminogen into plasmin was proved by using a chromogenic substrate, and furtherly confirmed to degrade extracellular matrix by using a reconstituted ECM. Finally, the ability of rGAPDH to bind different ECM components was demonstrated, including fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV and vitronectin. Collectively, our data imply GAPDH as an important adhesion factor of M. hyrohinis and a receptor for hijacking host plasminogen to degrade ECM. The multifunction of GAPDH to bind both plasminogen and ECM components is believed to increase the targeting of proteolysis and facilitate the dissemination of M. hyorhinis.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to infect and damage ciliated epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. In alveoli, gas exchange occurs across an epithelial-endothelial barrier that ties respiration to endothelial cell (EC) regulation of edema, coagulation, and inflammation. How SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates vascular functions to cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients remains an enigma focused on dysregulated EC responses. Whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects functions of the endothelium remains to be resolved and is critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that primary human ECs lack ACE2 receptors at protein and RNA levels and that SARS-CoV-2 is incapable of directly infecting ECs derived from pulmonary, cardiac, brain, umbilical vein, or kidney tissues. In contrast, pulmonary ECs transduced with recombinant ACE2 receptors are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and result in high viral titers (a1  107/ml), multinucleate syncytia, and EC lysis. SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-expressing ECs elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. The inability of SARS-CoV-2 to directly infect and lyse ECs without ACE2 expression explains the lack of vascular hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients and indicates that the endothelium is not a primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 indirectly activating EC programs that regulate thrombosis and endotheliitis in COVID-19 patients and focus strategies on therapeutically targeting epithelial and inflammatory responses that activate the endothelium or initiate limited ACE2-independent EC infection.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects pulmonary epithelial cells through ACE2 receptors and causes ARDS. COVID-19 causes progressive respiratory failure resulting from diffuse alveolar damage and systemic coagulopathy, thrombosis, and capillary inflammation that tie alveolar responses to EC dysfunction. This has prompted theories that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects ECs through ACE2 receptors, yet SARS-CoV-2 antigen has not been colocalized with ECs and prior studies indicate that ACE2 colocalizes with alveolar epithelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, not ECs. Here, we demonstrate that primary human ECs derived from lung, kidney, heart, brain, and umbilical veins require expression of recombinant ACE2 receptors in order to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 lytically infects ACE2-ECs and elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis resulting from indirect EC activation, or infection of a small subset of ECs by an ACE2-independent mechanism, that transforms rationales and targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Recombinant ACE2 Expression Is Required for SARS-CoV-2 To Infect Primary Human Endothelial Cells and Induce Inflammatory and Procoagulative Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on network learning theory, it investigates the effect of small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) experience of using foreign and domestic social network services (SNS) and foreign and domestic platforms (such as B2B digital platforms) on their international orientation.

However, data are limited. Using a longitudinal design, this study tested whether multiple facets of sleep were associated with fat mass gain over 1 year. METHODS: A convenience sample of non-treatment-seeking youth (age 8-17 years) wore actigraphy monitors for 14 days. Average weekly sleep duration, within-person sleep duration variability, weekend catch-up sleep, bedtime and wake time shift, social jet lag, bedtime, wake time, and sleep midpoint were calculated. The association of each facet of baseline sleep with 1-year fat mass, adjusting for baseline fat mass and height, was examined. RESULTS: A total of 137 youths (54.0% female; mean [SD], age 12.5 [2.6] years; 28.4% non-Hispanic Black or African American; baseline fat mass = 15.3 [8.9] kg; 1-year fat mass = 17.0 [10.0] kg; 28.5% with baseline overweight or obesity) were studied. Wake time (p = 0.03) and sleep midpoint (p = 0.02) were inversely associated with 1-year fat mass, such that earlier wake time and midpoint were associated with higher 1-year fat mass. No other facet of sleep was significantly associated with 1-year fat mass (p > 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Using objective measures, youth with earlier wake times and sleep midpoints had greater gains in fat mass. Additional research is needed to determine whether sleep timing may be a modifiable target to prevent pediatric obesity.","output":"Longitudinal associations between facets of sleep and adiposity in youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since 2010, large reductions in funding for local government services have been introduced in England. These reductions in funding have potentially led to reduced provision of health-promoting public services. We aimed to investigate whether areas that showed a greater decline in funding also had more adverse trends in life expectancy and premature mortality. METHODS: In this longitudinal ecological study, we linked annual data from the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government on local government revenue expenditure and financing to 147 upper-tier local authorities in England between 2013 and 2017 with data from Public Health England, on male and female life expectancy at birth, male and female life expectancy at age 65 years, and premature (younger than 75 years) all-cause mortality rate for male and female individuals. Local authorities were excluded if their populations were too small or if changes in boundaries meant consistent data were not available. Using multivariable fixed-effects panel regression models, and controlling for local socioeconomic conditions, we estimated whether changes in local funding from 2013 were associated with changes in life expectancy and premature mortality. We included a set of alternative model specifications to test the robustness of our findings. FINDINGS: Between 2013 and 2017, mean per-capita central funding to local governments decreased by 33% or 168 per person (range C385 to 1). Each 100 reduction in annual per person funding was associated over the study period 2013C17 with an average decrease in life expectancy at birth of 13 months (95% CI 07C19) for male individuals and 12 months (07C17) for female individuals; for life expectancy at age 65 years, the results show a decrease of 08 months (03C13) for male individuals and 11 months (07C15) for female individuals. Funding reductions were greater in more deprived areas and these areas had the worst changes in life expectancy. We estimated that cuts in funding were associated with an increase in the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived quintiles by 3% for men and 4% for women. Overall reductions in funding during this period were associated with an additional 9600 deaths in people younger than 75 years in England (3800C15 400), an increase of 125%. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that cuts in funding for local government might in part explain adverse trends in life expectancy. Given that more deprived areas showed greater reductions in funding, our analysis suggests that inequalities have widened. Since the pandemic, strategies to address these adverse trends in life expectancy and reduce health inequalities could prioritise reinvestment in funding for local government services, particularly within the most deprived areas of England.

The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. RESULTS: Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (999%, 95% CI 996C999) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (960%, 952C967) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $190 per day rose from five (02%, 00C05) of 2422 to 992 (473%, 452C495) of 2096 (p<00001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (56%, 47C66) of 2420 and 65 (27%, 21C34) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (365%, 345C384) of 2417 and 371 (153%, 139C168) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 517% (481C554; p<00001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh. Beyond supporting only the most socioeconomically deprived, support is needed for all affected families.

While there have been indications that precaution fatigue could be a key factor, no scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic metapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by assuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while only three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction (k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic fatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would have reduced by 68% on average. Our study shows that pandemic fatigue is the major cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States. Reduced vigilance is responsible for most positive cases, and higher mortality rate tends to push local people to react to the outbreak faster and maintain vigilant for longer time.","output":"Impact of pandemic fatigue on the spread of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Within the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths.

Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, caseCcontrol analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes.

In the UK, national endoscopy database (NED) indicated activity was dramatically reduced by 80-95% during the first wave in 2020, due to redeployment of staff, challenges with personal protective equipment (PPE), room air-change cycle and patients unwillingness to attend during lockdown restrictions. ERCP is a higher-risk procedure often performed in patients with an urgent indication such as cancer obstruction or gallstone-related biliary sepsis or pancreatitis. We aimed to define the impact of COVID-19 on our ERCP service delivery, clinical outcomes, patient safety and endoscopists KPIs.MethodsWe examined Nottingham ERCP outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to those before in 2019 at a high-volume HPB endoscopy centre serving a local population of 750,000 and tertiary HPB MDT population of 2.3 million. Technical success, comfort rates and complications according to RCP JAG and ESGE quality standards, including 8- and 30-day readmission rates and deaths were recorded. We also assessed the incidence of Covid-19 infection among the population who underwent ERCP.ResultsPre-pandemic, during 2019, 686 ERCP procedures were performed. Of these, 433 (63.1%) were cases of first ever ERCP. In 2020, 614 ERCPs were performed including 390 (63.5%) cases of first ever ERCP. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared to 2019, there was no significant reduction in any of: total number of ERCP procedures (619 vs. 686);virgin ERCP successful cannulation of the intended duct (91.3% vs. 89.6%;p=0.8);complete CBD stone clearance (80% vs. 81%;p=0.9);successful stent placement across extrahepatic stricture (91.9% vs. 97.3%;p=0.6);obtaining stricture cytology (85.6% vs. 84.4%;p=0.9). The sensitivity of biliary cytology for cancer (C5 or C4 with compatible imaging/tumour markers or clinical follow up) was 68% vs. 70%;p=0.6.Patient comfort score was recorded as moderate/severe in 6% of cases in 2019 vs. 7.1% in 2020 (p=0.4). Following ERCP, the number of patients re-admitted within 8- and 30-days was 22 (3.2%) and 37 (5.4%) in 2019, versus 30 (4.9%) and 42 (6.8%) in 2020;p= 0.15 and p= 0.3, respectively. All-cause and procedure-related mortality within 30 days from ERCP was 1.6% and 0.14% in 2019 vs. 1.79% and 0.65% in 2020;p=0.8 and p=0.15, respectively.In total, 25/9500 (0.26%) of all patients undergoing any endoscopy tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of endoscopy. However, none tested positive following ERCP.ConclusionsOur provision of clinically urgent ERCP during 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly fall due to combination of senior prioritisation of all referrals, accessing unused operating theatres and reducing training lists. Patients underwent ERCP in a safe environment, keeping comfort levels within accepted limits and post-operative Covid-19 infection levels to zero.

Here we directly compare a targeted amplicon sequencing approach (using ARTIC v3;hereafter referred to as sequencing) with RT-ddPCR quantification for the detection of five mutations that are characteristic of variants of concern (VoCs) in wastewater samples. In total, 547 wastewater samples were analyzed using both methods in parallel. When we observed positive mutation detections by RT-ddPCR, 42.6% of the detection events were missed by sequencing, due to negative detection or the limited read coverage at the mutation position. Further, when sequencing reported negative or depth-limited mutation detections, 26.7% of those events were instead positive detections by RT-ddPCR, highlighting the relatively poor sensitivity of sequencing. No or weak associations were observed between quantitative measurements of target mutations determined by RT-ddPCR and sequencing.

METHODS: Data on the availability and price of 17 antibiotics and 6 antiviral medicines in 41 public hospitals were obtained from the Jiangsu Institute of Medicine Information. We adopted the WHO/Health Action International method to measure the availability, cost and affordability of these medicines. RESULTS: The availability of selected medicines against infectious diseases was relatively low; the median availability of originator brands was near-zero and that of lowest-priced generics during the survey period less than 50%. The total availability of medicines was poor in primary hospitals as compared to secondary and tertiary hospitals. The median daily-defined dose cost of originator brands was expensive (range from 66.11 RMB to 107.83 RMB), whereas that of lowest price generics was fairly acceptable at < 8 RMB. The affordability of most surveyed medicines was reasonable, which showed significant improvement over time, but the daily cost of a few medicines for originator brands exceeded the average daily wage.

The differential diagnosis includes an immune reaction to the prosthesis. However, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for immune failure, an allergic reaction, to a TKA. Histologic evaluation could provide evidence as to whether an allergic reaction caused TKA failure. A recent study showed an increase in CD4+ lymphocytes compared to CD8+ lymphocytes in patients LTT+ for Ni. This finding is consistent with Ni sensitization, but can lymphocyte subsets be used to diagnose immune failure on a case-by-case basis? METHODS Periprosthetic tissues from 18 revision cases of well-fixed, aseptic, but painful and/or stiff primary TKAs were analyzed. Six patients LTT- for Ni were matched as a cohort for age, sex, and BMI, to 12 patients LTT+ for Ni. Periprosthetic tissue biopsies underwent IHC staining for CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte subsets and were compared by LTT status. The IHC results were also compared with periprosthetic histology.

In response to these warnings, we ask how schools, families, and communities can counteract disaster capitalism for educational equity. To address this question, we first synthesize a critical framework for analyzing digital inequity in education. We then dissect the strategies disaster capitalism uses to attack the school-family-community relationship and exacerbate digital inequity in ?normal? times as well as during crises. Employing the notion of community funds of knowledge, we next examine the resources schools, families, and communities can mobilize against disaster capitalism and digital inequity. Finally, guided by the concepts of generative change and transformative learning, we consider actionable practices of countering disaster capitalism for a transformative education.","output":"After the Virus: Disaster Capitalism, Digital Inequity, and Transformative Education for the Future of Schooling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the context of the Sars-Cov2 pandemic, the management of patients with chronic diseases and/or receiving immunosuppressive drugs was of concern due to lack of data to dictate their management. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 among IBD patients and to study the factors associated with severe COVID-19. Methods: We carried out a multicentre bispective study in 30 French GETAID centres. Participating centres were asked to report all consecutive COVID19 cases occurring in their IBD-cohort between March,1st and December,31st 2020. The cases had to be confirmed by a PCR test, or by a chest CT scan demonstrating COVID19 lesions. In addition to the baseline examination, patients were scheduled for a follow up visit within 3-6 months following their infection. Demographics, disease characteristics, treatments, and the clinical course of IBD were prospectively recorded. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to the hospital >1 day and/or use of oxygen therapy and/or death. Predictive factors for developing severe COVID-19 were explored using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 719 IBD patients with COVID 19 were included;54.2% were women, median age was 42 years, 64.4% had Crohn's disease (CD), and median disease duration was 10.8 years. 13.3% of the patients were active smokers;12.7% had a BMI>30. With respect to the treatment, 72(10%) patients were not on any IBD medication, 75(10.4%) were only receiving 5-ASA, 164(22.8%) received conventional immunosuppressants, and 509(70.8%) biologics.21.6% of the patients developed either diarrhoea in remitters, or an exacerbation of diarrhoea in active patients. IBD treatments were maintained unchanged, suspended or discontinued in 73.4%, 25.5%, and 1.1% of the patients. Over the follow-up period, 13.2% of the patients had a flare. A total of 68 patients developed severe COVID 19, 67(9.3%) were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days, and 4(0.6%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, age > 50 years (OR: 2.0,CI:1.06-3.72;p=0.031), obesity (OR: 2.01,CI:1.05-4.09;p=0.037), and comorbidities (OR: 3.28,CI:1.76-6.09;p=0.0002) were factors associated with the occurrence of severe COVID 19;while immunomodulatory treatment (biologic and/or immunosuppressant) was a protective factor for developing severe COVID 19 (OR: 0.38,CI: 0.22-0.69;p=0.0012). Conclusion: Rate of severe COVID 19 in this cohort of IBD patients was corresponding to the general population with similar risk factors for severity, i.e., age, obesity and comorbidities. Prescription of immunomodulators was protective against severe COVID 19, raising the hypothesis of their potential immunological effect on the immune storm phase of Sars-Cov2.","output":"Immunomodulators are protective against severe covid 19: Results from a large multicentre cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The adoption of prophylaxis attitudes, such as social isolation and use of face masks, to mitigate epidemic outbreaks strongly depends on the support of the population. In this work, we investigate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model, in which the epidemiological perception of the environment can adapt the behavior of susceptible individuals towards preventive behavior. {Two compartments of susceptible individuals are considered, to distinguish those that adopt or not prophylaxis attitudes.} Two rules, depending on local and global epidemic prevalence, for the spread of the epidemic in heterogeneous networks are investigated. We present the results of both heterogeneous mean-field theory and stochastic simulations. The former performs well for the global rule, but misses relevant outcomes of simulations in the local case. In simulations, only local awareness can significantly raise the epidemic threshold, delay the peak of prevalence, and reduce the outbreak size. Interestingly, we observed that increasing the local perception rate leads to less individuals recruited to the protected state, but still enhances the effectiveness in mitigating the outbreak. We also report that network heterogeneity substantially reduces the efficacy of local awareness mechanisms since hubs, the super-spreaders of the SIR dynamics, are little responsive to epidemic environments in the low epidemic prevalence regime.

This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between anxiety induced by COVID-19 and perceived social support in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS This online cross-sectional study was conducted on 801 pregnant women from all over Iran in 2020. The data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the multidimensional scale of perceived social support, and the coronavirus disease anxiety scale. A standard multiple linear regression model was used to identify the association between perceived social support and anxiety, controlling for possible confounding variables. Partial r was used as an estimate of effect size. RESULTS The mean anxiety score was 10.7  8.0, in which its level was moderate in 122 (15.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.8-17.9%)) of the participants, and severe in 28 (3.4%; 95% CI: 2.3-5.0%) of them. The mean score of perceived social support was 48.2  7.6. 6.9% (95% CI: 5.2-8.8%) and 93.1% (95% CI: 91.2-94.8%) of the participants reported mild and moderate levels of perceived social support, respectively. The results of the multiple linear model showed a significant negative correlation between perceived social support and anxiety levels in a way that for every 10 units increase in the perceived social support score, the anxiety level of pregnant women was decreased by 0.8 units (B= -0.08, t= -2.08, p = 0.037), which was a small effect size (partial r = -0.07).

Oxygen supply, nasogastric  endotracheal tubes are considered. Proof-of-concept: prototypes were tested in pediatric models of refractory cardiac arrest (20min), showed restoration of hemodynamics (BP100 mm Hg) and urine output, regardless of heartbeats, pharmacological supports and mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: ESS enhancement represents a more effective treatment to increase tissue oxygenation and improve hemodynamic in ARDS.

As with other RNA viruses, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene have been continuously evolving. Recently, four variants have been identified, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C. These variants appear to be more infectious and transmissible than the original Wuhan-Hu-1 virus. Using a combination of bioinformatics and structural analyses, we show that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of an already known Spike protein mutation D614G together with another mutation P323L in the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the CAL.20C and B.1.351 shared one common ancestor, whereas the B.1.1.7 and P.1 shared a different ancestor. Structural comparisons did not show any significant difference between the wild-type and mutant ACE2/Spike complexes. Structural analysis indicated that the N501Y mutation may increase hydrophobic interactions at the ACE2/Spike interface. However, reported greater binding affinity of N501Y Spike with ACE2 does not seem to be entirely due to increased hydrophobic interactions, given that Spike mutation R417T in P.1 or K417N in B.1.351 results in the loss of a salt-bridge interaction between ACE2 and S-RBD. The calculated change in free energy did not provide a clear trend of S protein stability of mutations in the variants. As expected, we show that the CAL.20C generally migrated from the west coast to the east coast of the USA.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey carried out between 5 May and 5 June 2021. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 4198 individuals from urban and rural settings in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone participated in the survey. STUDY REGISTRATION: The general protocol is registered on clinicaltrial.gov. RESULTS: Findings show that in West Africa at the time only 53% of all study participants reported to be aware of COVID-19 vaccines, and television (60%, n=1345), radio (56%; n=1258), social media (34%; n=764) and family/friends/neighbours (28%; n=634) being the most important sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Adult COVID-19 vaccine acceptance ranges from 60% in Guinea and 50% in Sierra Leone to 11% in Senegal. This is largely congruent with acceptance levels of COVID-19 vaccinations for children. Multivariable regression analysis shows that perceived effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines increased the willingness to get vaccinated. However, sociodemographic factors, such as sex, rural/urban residence, educational attainment and household composition (living with children and/or elderly), and the other perception parameters were not associated with the willingness to get vaccinated in the multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Primary sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines include television, radio and social media.

Male faculty were rated higher in overall teaching ability (male=4.69 vs. female=4.63, p=0.003) and in four of the six ACGME competencies (MK, PROF, PBLI, and SBP) based on our institutional evaluation form. In the inpatient setting, male faculty were rated more favorably for overall teaching (male = 4.70, female = 4.53, p=<0.001) and across all ACGME competencies. The only observed gender difference in the outpatient setting favored female faculty in PC (male = 4.65, female = 4.71, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Male and female GIM faculty performance was assessed differently by trainees. Gender-based differences were impacted by the setting of evaluation, with the greatest difference by gender noted in the inpatient setting.","output":"Gendered Expectations: the Impact of Gender, Evaluation Language, and Clinical Setting on Resident Trainee Assessment of Faculty Performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. However, the magnitude of the disparity is unclear because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. METHODS: We quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 notification, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias analysis for misclassification. RESULTS: The ratio of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity in notification rates after bias adjustment, compared with the complete case analysis, increased 1.3-fold for persons classified Black and 1.6-fold for those classified Hispanic, in reference to classified White persons. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in notification rates. Complete reporting of race/ethnicity information is necessary for health equity. When data are missing, quantitative bias analysis methods may improve estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.","output":"Estimating the Unknown: Greater Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Burden After Accounting for Missing Race and Ethnicity Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our research goal was to examine health risk perception and adherence to vaccination against COVID-19 among various social and demographic population groups in Belarus. To achieve this goal, a cross-sectional study was accomplished via using an online poll. The obtained results reveal that perception of health risks caused by COVID-19 is quite significant among people living in Belarus since only 9.9 % of the questioned do not consider COVID-19 a dangerous disease. Higher levels of risk perception have been detected among medical personnel, older age groups, and people with chronic pathologies. Most respondents believe vaccination is among the most efficient anti-COVID-19 measures;however, people are rather poorly aware about provided opportunities to get vaccinated. 33.6 % among respondents who are not vaccinated dont plan to do it with;their basic reasons for this refusal are lack of trust, both in vaccines being safe and efficient and overall trust in preparations suggested for vaccination. Having analyzed answers given by respondents who were medical workers we revealed that a greater share of them were vaccinated but reasons for refusing from vaccination were the same. 20.1 % respondents from all groups and 21.2 % medical workers who took part in the questioning stated that they needed additional information about vaccination. When developing communication strategies aimed at raising awareness among population, we should bear in mind that lower perception of COVID-19-related health risks and refusal from vaccination are more widely spread among people younger than 40;people who dont have higher education;people with minor children in their families. Prevalence of lower COVID-19-related health risk perception is also greater among men;people who dont live in the capital;people with elderly relatives in their families.

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious.

We sought to understand its effects on vascular surgery practices stratified by VASCON surgical readiness level and determine how these effects have changed during the course of the pandemic. METHODS: All members of the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society were sent electronic surveys questioning the effects of COVID-19 on their practices in the early pandemic in April (EP) and four months later in the pandemic in August (LP) 2020. RESULTS: Response rates were 206/731 (28%) in the EP group and 108/731 (15%) in the LP group (P < 0.0001). Most EP respondents reported VASCON levels less than 3 (168/206,82%), indicating increased hospital limitations while 6/108 (6%) in the LP group reported this level (P < 0.0001). The EP group was more likely to report a lower VASCON level (increased resource limitations), and decreased clinic, hospital and emergency room consults. Despite an increase of average cases/week to pre-COVID-19 levels, 46/108 (43%) of LP report continued decreased compensation, with 57% reporting more than 10% decrease. Respondents in the decreased compensation group were more likely to have reported a VASCON level 3 or lower earlier in the pandemic (P = 0.018). 91/108(84%) of LP group have treated COVID-19 patients for thromboembolic events, most commonly acute limb ischemia (76/108) and acute DVT (76/108). While the majority of respondents are no longer delaying the vascular surgery cases, 76/108 (70%) feel that vascular patient care has suffered due to earlier delays, and 36/108 (33%) report a backlog of cases caused by the pandemic.

We sought to investigate the details, determinants, and prognostic significance of symptom burden in hospitalized patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively evaluated consecutive hospitalized patients with HF as primary diagnosis at our institution using the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) both on admission and at discharge. The IPOS, which is a well\\\\validated multi\\\\dimensional symptom assessment scale among advanced illness, consists of 17 questions for enquiring about physical symptoms (10 items), emotional symptoms (4 items) and communication and practical issues (3 items) using a 5\\\\point Likert scale (0 [best]C4 [worst] points). Clinically relevant symptoms were defined as 2 points for each IPOS item. Worsening symptom burden was defined as the total IPOS score at discharge being poorer than that on admission. Of 294 patients (mean age: 77.5  12.0 years, male: 168 patients, New York Heart Association class IV: 96 patients, mean left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: 44%, and median N\\\\terminal pro B\\\\type natriuretic peptide [NT\\\\proBNP] level: 4418 ng/L), the median (IQR) total IPOS score on admission was 19 (12, 27) and they were widely distributed (minimum: 0 C maximum: 52). The total IPOS score on admission was not correlated with the HF severity, including LVEF (Spearman's  = ?0.05, P = 0.43), NT\\\\proBNP levels (Spearman's  = 0.08, P = 0.20) or in\\\\hospital mortality prediction model (GWTG\\\\HF risk score) (Spearman's  = 0.01, P = 0.90). Total IPOS scores significantly decreased during hospitalization as a whole (median [IQR]: 13 [6, 21] at discharge; P < 0.001 vs. those on admission). All of the four emotional symptoms (patient anxiety, depression, family anxiety and feeling at peace) remained in the top 5 of clinically relevant symptoms at discharge, whereas none of 10 physical symptoms were nominated. Worsening symptom burden was noted in 28% of the patients during hospitalization, and was independently associated with higher all\\\\cause mortality after discharge (hazard ratio: 2.28, 95% confidence interval: 1.02C5.09; P = 0.044) even after adjustment by age and HF mortality prediction model (MAGGIC risk score). CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that hospitalized patients with HF had multi\\\\dimensional symptom burdens which varied among individuals and were not correlated with the disease severity. Emotional symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, were the main clinically relevant symptoms at discharge. A worsening IPOS score was noted in a quarter of patients with HF and was associated with a poor prognosis, suggesting the importance of holistic symptom assessment during the course of hospitalization for HF.","output":"Comprehensive symptom assessment using Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale in hospitalized heart failure patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths To date, there is no approved targeted treatment, and many investigational therapeutic agents and vaccine candidates are being considered for the treatment of COVID-19 To extract and summarize information on potential vaccines and therapeutic agents against COVID-19 at different stages of clinical trials from January to March 2020, we reviewed major clinical trial databases such as ClinicalTrials gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and other primary registries between January and March 15, 2020 Interventional studies at different phases under the COVID-19 pipeline were included A total of 249 clinical trials were identified between January to March 15, 2020 After filtering observational studies (194 studies), a total of 56 interventional trials were considered The majority of clinical trials have been conducted on chloroquine (n=10) and traditional Chinese medications (TCMs;n=10), followed by antivirals (n=8), anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressants (n=9), cellular therapies (n=4), combinations of different antivirals therapies (n=3), antibacterial (n=1), and other therapies (n=5) Five vaccines are under phase I, and there are a couple of phase III trials on the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine under investigation among healthcare workers Many novel compounds and vaccines against COVID-19 are currently under investigation Some candidates have been tested for other viral infections and are listed for clinical trials against the COVID-19 pipeline Currently, there are no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations available for the treatment of COVID-19","output":"Vaccines and Drug Therapeutics to Lock Down Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO has declared COVID-19 illness a global health concern which is caused by 2019-nCoV, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans.

Therefore, a computational survey was carried out for the Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genome with the open reading frames from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Seventeen functional sequences were used to analyze promoter regions and their regulatory elements. RESULT: The present study revealed that 94% of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes contained more than two TSSs. Among these identified TSSs, a TSS with the highest predictive score was considered to determine a promoter region of the genes. Moreover, a total of five common candidate motifs such as MotI, MotII, MotIII, MotIV, and MotV were identified. Among these motifs, motif IV was investigated as the common promoter motif for 41.17% of genes that serve as binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) involved in the expression regulation of Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genes. Motif IV was also compared to registered motifs in publically available databases to see if they are similar to known regulatory motifs for TF using TOMTOM web server. Hence, it was revealed that MotIV might serve as the binding site mainly for the leucine zipper TF gene family to regulate a gene expression of Trametes hirsuta strain 072. Regarding CpG island determination, it was concluded that there is no CpG island in both promoter and gene body regions of the Trametes hirsuta strain 072 genome.

However, the active components of YPF and the mechanisms of components affecting COVID-19 are unclear. This study aimed to determine active constituents and elucidate its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS) were used to determine the components and absorbable constituents of YPF. Secondly, TCMSP, Drugbank, Swiss and PharmMapper were used to search the targets of absorbable bioactive constituents of YPF, and the targets of COVID-19 were identified based on GeneCards and OMIM databases. STRING database was used to filter the possible inter-protein interactions. Thirdly, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were performed to identify molecular function and systemic involvement of target genes. RESULTS: A total of 61 components of YPF and 36 absorbable constituents were identified through UPLC-Q/TOF-MS. Wogonin, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, 5-O-methylvisamminol, astragaloside IV and 5-O-methylvisamminol (hydroxylation) were vital constituents for the treatment of COVID-19, and RELA, TNF, IL-6, MAPK14 and MAPK8ere recognized as key targets of YPF.

Observations that orthologues show almost no variation across vertebrates yet differ by two amino acids between humans and chimpanzees have led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes might relate to the emergence of language. Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and often for prey capture. To determine whether mutations in the FoxP2 gene could be associated with echolocation, we sequenced FoxP2 from echolocating and non-echolocating bats as well as a range of other mammal species. We found that contrary to previous reports, FoxP2 is not highly conserved across all nonhuman mammals but is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. We detected divergent selection (a change in selective pressure) at FoxP2 between bats with contrasting sonar systems, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a role for FoxP2 in the evolution and development of echolocation.

This study was performed to compare SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) testing using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. METHODS: Parallel SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and quantitative N-Ag ELISA analysis was executed on nasopharyngeal specimens obtained during SARS-CoV-2 screening in a cohort of pre-hospitalization patients. RESULTS: In total, 277 specimens were examined, including 182 (65.7%) RT-PCR-positive specimens, which demonstrated a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27 (interquartile range (IQR) 23-35). The SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag was detected in 164 of the 182 RT-PCR-positive specimens (overall sensitivity 90.1%). Among the 95 RT-PCR-negative specimens, 72 were N-Ag-negative (specificity 75.8%).

Cognitive task analysis and mental rehearsal were the most common forms of cognitive training identified. All 11 publications supported the use of cognitive training in orthopaedic surgery training. In the six randomized controlled trials, the utilization of cognitive training was associated with notably improved surgical performance and increased knowledge compared with traditional methods of learning. DISCUSSION: Based on the limited evidence presented in this review, cognitive training represents a promising, low-cost adjunct to traditional orthopaedic surgery training. Further efforts should be directed at developing and evaluating additional cognitive training tools for orthopaedic surgery trainees.","output":"Cognitive Training in Orthopaedic Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective Not everyone gets sick after an exposure to influenza A viruses (IAV). Although KLRD1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for influenza susceptibility, it remains unclear whether forecasting symptomatic flu infection based on pre-exposure host gene expression might be possible. Method To examine this hypothesis, we developed DeepFlu using the state-of-the-art deep learning approach on the human gene expression data infected with IAV subtype H1N1 or H3N2 viruses to forecast who would catch the flu prior to an exposure to IAV. Results The results indicated that such forecast is possible and, in other words, gene expression could reflect the strength of host immunity. In the leave-one-person-out cross-validation, DeepFlu based on deep neural network outperformed the models using convolutional neural network, random forest, or support vector machine, achieving 70.0% accuracy, 0.787 AUROC, and 0.758 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.8% accuracy, 0.847 AUROC, and 0.901 AUPR for H3N2. In the external validation, DeepFlu also reached 71.4% accuracy, 0.700 AUROC, and 0.723 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.5% accuracy, 0.732 AUROC, and 0.749 AUPR for H3N2, surpassing the KLRD1 biomarker. In addition, DeepFlu which was trained only by pre-exposure data worked the best than by other time spans and mixed training data of H1N1 and H3N2 did not necessarily enhance prediction. DeepFlu is available at https://github.com/ntou-compbio/DeepFlu. Conclusions DeepFlu is a prognostic tool that can moderately recognize individuals susceptible to the flu and may help prevent the spread of IAV.","output":"DeepFlu: a deep learning approach for forecasting symptomatic influenza A infection based on pre-exposure gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ensuring that public feedback on preprints is focused, appropriate, specific and transparent (or FAST) will help to develop a thriving culture for reviewing and commenting on preprints.","output":"Promoting constructive feedback on preprints with the FAST principles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dental anxiety is a crucial problem for dentistry because it may represent a significant risk to oral health.

Although research indicates important determinants of HIV acquisition at the individual and interpersonal levels, structural-level stigma and discrimination continue to be critical barriers to reaching and retaining this key population for HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health services. Innovative and multilevel interventions are needed that can address the intersectional structural and gender issues that young women face, including stigma, alcohol and drug use, gender-based violence, and other risk factors when seeking health services. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken daily has been found to be an effective biomedical HIV prevention tool. Testing a comprehensive gender-focused biobehavioral HIV prevention intervention that is inclusive of social ecological determinants, such as stigma and discrimination reduction in clinics, is critical for reducing HIV among adolescent girls and young women. METHODS: This project involves both a Community Collaborative Board and a Youth Advisory Board in helping to adapt the Young Womens Health CoOp intervention and the Health Policy Project (HPP) Stigma and Discrimination (S&D) reduction training curriculum to the setting and population. This study uses a two-by-two factorial design with stratified randomization of 12 clinics, each with distinct catchment areas. The Young Womens Health CoOp addresses substance use, sexual risk, violence prevention and sexual negotiation, condom demonstration, and problem solving with the following additions: knowledge of PrEP, the importance of PrEP adherence, and sexual and reproductive health. Adolescent girls and young women will be assessed with behavioral and biological measures at baseline, 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-up. The S&D reduction training is provided for all staff in the clinics randomized to this condition. Clinic staff will be surveyed at baseline, 4- and 8-month follow-up. We will recruit 900 AGYW from communities in the 12 clinic catchment areas.

The non-invasive and high-resolution technique of optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used intraoperatively to assess intestine viability and associated conditions that frequently emerge under conditions of impaired blood circulation. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal (MM) OCT for intraoperative diagnostics of both the microstructure (crosspolarization OCT mode) and microcirculation (OCT angiography mode) of the small intestine wall in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Methods and Participants: A total of 18 patients were enrolled in the study. Nine of them suffered from AMI in segments II-III of the superior mesenteric artery (AMI group), whereby the ischemic segments of the intestine were examined. Nine others were operated on for adenocarcinoma of the colon (control group), thus allowing areas of their normal small intestine to be examined for comparison. Data on the microstructure and microcirculation in the walls of the small intestine were obtained intraoperatively from the side of the serous membrane using the MM OCT system (IAP RAS, Russia) before bowel resection. The MM OCT data were compared with the results of histological examination. Results: The study finds that MM OCT visualized the damage to serosa, muscularis externa, and blood vessels localized in these layers in 100% of AMI cases. It also visualized the submucosa in 33.3% of AMI cases. The MM OCT images of non-ischemic (control group), viable ischemic, and necrotic small intestines (AMI group) differed significantly across stratification of the distinguishable layers, the severity of intermuscular fluid accumulations, and the type and density of the vasculature. Conclusion: The MM OCT diagnostic procedure optimally meets the requirements of emergency surgery. Data on the microstructure and microcirculation of the intestinal wall can be obtained simultaneously in real time without requiring contrast agent injections. The depth of visualization of the intestinal wall from the side of the serous membrane is sufficient to assess the volume of the affected tissues. However, the methodology for obtaining MM OCT data needs to be improved to minimize the motion artefacts generated in actual clinical conditions.","output":"Prospects of Intraoperative Multimodal OCT Application in Patients with Acute Mesenteric Ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this submission is to describe how and when to best use hemostats, sealants, and adhesives as well as to compare their characteristics and to update the surgical toolbox with respect to any new products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of this date (November 2009).

Composition, shape, size, and colour, among other characteristics, are associated with their capacity to access the food chain and their risks. While the environmental impact of MPs has received much attention, the risks for humans derived from their dietary exposure have not been yet assessed. Several institutions and researchers support that the current knowledge does not supply solid data to complete a solid risk characterization of dietary MPs. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge about MPs in foods and to discuss the challenges and gaps for a risk analysis. The presence of MPs in food and beverages has been worldwide observed, but most authors considered the current data to be not only insufficient but of questionable quality mainly because of the outstanding lack of consensus about a standardized quantifying method and a unified nomenclature. Drinking water, crustaceans/molluscs, fish, and salt have been identified as relevant dietary sources of MPs for humans by most published studies. The hazard characterization presents several gaps concerning the knowledge of the toxicokinetic, toxicodynamic, and toxicity of MPs in humans that impede the estimation of food safety standards based on risk. This review provides a tentative exposure assessment based on the levels of MPs published for drinking water, crustaceans and molluscs, fish, and salt and using the mean European dietary consumption estimates. The intake of 2 L/day of water, 70.68 g/day of crustaceans/molluscs, 70.68 g/day of fish, and 9.4 g/day of salt would generate a maximum exposure to 33,626, 212.04, 409.94 and 6.40 particles of MPs/day, respectively. The inexistence of reference values to evaluate the MPs dietary intake prevents the dietary MPs risk characterization and therefore the management of this risk. Scientists and Food Safety Authorities face several challenges but also opportunities associated to the occurrence of MPs in foods. More research on the MPs characterization and exposure is needed bearing in mind that any future risk assessment report should involve a total diet perspective.","output":"Microplastics as Emerging Food Contaminants: A Challenge for Food Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To compare demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes of patients with and without concomitant cardiac disease, hospitalized for COVID-19 in Brescia, Lombardy, Italy.

SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says \\"Id rather have HIV than diabetes\\" as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes. RESULTS: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and the ?-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.

It is aimed to identify differences in the dynamics of the individual TMDs of the two types of viral membrane proteins. The assumption is made that the dynamics of the individual TMDs are decoupled from their extra-membrane domains, and that the mechanics of the TMDs are distinct from each other due to the different mechanism of function of the two types of proteins. The diffusivity coefficient (DC) of the translational and rotational diffusion is decreased in the oligomeric state of the TMDs compared to those values when calculated from simulations in their monomeric state. When comparing the calculations for two different lengths of the TMD, a longer full peptide and a shorter purely TMD stretch, (i) the difference of the calculated DCs begins to level out when the difference exceeds approximately 15 amino acids per peptide chain, and (ii) the channel protein rotational DC is the most affected diffusion parameter.

The asymptomatic nature of COVID-19 obfuscates the signs policy makers look for when deciding to reopen public areas or further quarantine. In much of the world, testing resources are often scarce, creating a need for testing potentially infected individuals that prioritizes efficiency. This report presents an advancement to Beigel and Kasifs Approximate Counting Algorithm (ACA). ACA estimates the infection rate with a number of tests that is logarithmic in the population size. Our newer version of the algorithm provides an extra level of efficiency: each subject is tested exactly once. A simulation of the algorithm, created for and presented as part of this paper, can be used to find a linear regression of the results with R2 > 0.999. This allows stakeholders and members of the biomedical community to estimate infection rates for varying population sizes and ranges of infection rates.","output":"A Partition-Based Group Testing Algorithm for Estimating the Number of Infected Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS Treatment for childhood and adolescent brain tumours is often intensive, with significant neurocognitive and psycho-social late effects (Zeltzer et al., 2009). This feasibility Study aimed to inform the development of a cognitive rehabilitation and psycho-social group intervention for Teenage and Young Adult (TYA) survivors of brain tumours. METHODS A group-based intervention incorporated ideas from the current evidence base, including psychoeducation and compensatory strategy training, with a focus on real-life goals and improving quality of life. Participants (N = 19, 13-24 years) were recruited from the University College London Hospital TYA Oncology Service. Participants had received treatment for a malignant brain tumour and had completed their treatment at least 1 year prior to participation. Four group-based, whole-day interventions ran every 3 months throughout a year. Feasibility criteria were established to answer questions about acceptability of the intervention and recruitment. RESULTS Qualitative and quantitative feedback from all four groups demonstrated acceptability and suitability of the intervention with regards to the content, structure and delivery. Recruitment presented more of a challenge with 35% fewer referrals than expected. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Feedback suggests that the intervention is suitable and acceptable, whilst limitations include numbers of referrals and referral pathways.

Since university students could be considered a knowledgeable group, this study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among this group in Jordan. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. We used an online survey conducted in January 2021 with a chain-referral sampling approach. Conspiracy beliefs were evaluated using the validated Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores implying embrace of conspiracies. A total of 1106 respondents completed the survey with female predominance (n = 802, 72.5%). The intention to get COVID-19 vaccines was low: 34.9% (yes) compared to 39.6% (no) and 25.5% (maybe). Higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were seen among males (42.1%) and students at Health Schools (43.5%). A Low rate of influenza vaccine acceptance was seen as well (28.8%), in addition to 18.6% of respondents being anti-vaccination altogether. A significantly higher VCBS score was correlated with reluctance to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Dependence on social media platforms was significantly associated with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (19.8%) compared to dependence on medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals (47.2%, p < 0.001). The results of this study showed the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with conspiracy beliefs among university students in Jordan. The implementation of targeted actions to increase the awareness of such a group is highly recommended.

A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of \\"mismatched\\" data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.","output":"Phase-locking of resting-state brain networks with the gastric basal electrical rhythm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To estimate the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGDs) among patients infected with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Results A total of twenty-four studies with data from 8438 test-confirmed COVID-19 patients from thirteen countries were included. The pooled proportion of patients presenting with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions was 41.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.5% to 53.9) and 38.2% (95% CI 24.0 to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = -0.076; p=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = -0.073; p=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared to self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; p=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by gender was observed. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19.

Worldwide by that date, there had been 102 million cases of infections, and deaths had climbed to 2.21 million. Mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have emerged from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa are associated with higher transmission rates and associated deaths. Therefore, novel therapeutic and prophylactic methods against SARS-CoV-2 are in urgent need. While some antiviral drugs, such as Remdesivir, provide relief to certain patient populations, other existing antiviral drugs or combinations of FDA approved pharmaceuticals have yet to show clinical efficacy against COVID-19. Compounds that possess strong and broad antiviral properties with different mechanisms of action against respiratory viruses may provide novel approaches to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, especially if the compounds are classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). A large body of evidence indicates a promising potential for the use of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and its derivatives as effective agents against infections from a wide range of pathogenic viruses. However, EGCG or its derivatives have not been tested directly against SARS-CoV-2. The current study was designed to evaluate the potential antiviral activity of EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 infection in primate epithelial cells. Methods applied in the study include cytopathic effect (CPE) assay and virus yield reduction (VYR) assays using Vero 76 (green monkey epithelial cells) and Caco-2 (human epithelial cells) cell lines, respectively. The results demonstrated that EGCG at 0.27 g/ml (0.59 M) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero 76 cells by 50% (i.e., EC50=0.27 g/ml). EGCG also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-2 cells with EC90=28 g/ml (61 M). These results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first observations on the antiviral activities of EGCG against SARS-CoV-2, and suggest that EGCG and its derivatives could be used to combat COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infection-induced illness, pending in vivo and clinical studies.","output":"Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Primate Epithelial Cells: (A Short Communication)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Digital interventions are effective for reducing alcohol consumption but evidence is limited regarding smartphone apps.

Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients.

OBJECTIVE: In our prospective study, we aim to conduct multimodal assessments to determine the feasibility of an individualized approach for understanding the contextual factors of changes in daily affect, sleep, physiology, and activity. In other words, we aim to use event mining to predict changes in mental health. METHODS: We expect to have a final sample size of 20 participants. Recruited participants will be monitored for a period of time (ie, between 3 and 12 months). Participants will download the Personicle app on their smartphone to track their activities (eg, home events and cycling). They will also be given wearable sensor devices (ie, devices that monitor sleep, physiology, and physical activity), which are to be worn continuously. Participants will be asked to report on their daily moods and provide open-ended text responses on a weekly basis. Participants will be given a battery of questionnaires every 3 months. RESULTS: Our study has been approved by an institutional review board. The study is currently in the data collection phase. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was adjusted to allow for remote data collection and COVID-19-related stress assessments.

At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes. Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD exhibits a considerably dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. In this Review, we discuss vascular intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of how ageing influences the pathology of atherosclerosis. First, we focus on factors that are extrinsic to the vasculature. We discuss how ageing affects the development of myeloid cells leading to the expansion of certain myeloid cell clones and induces changes in myeloid cell functions that promote atherosclerosis via inflammation, including a potential role for IL-6. Next, we describe vascular intrinsic factors by which ageing promotes atherogenesis  in particular, the effects on mitochondrial function. Studies in mice and humans have shown that ageing leads to a decline in vascular mitochondrial function and impaired mitophagy. In mice, ageing is associated with an elevation in the levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the aorta, which participates in a positive feedback loop with the impaired vascular mitochondrial function to accelerate atherogenesis. We speculate that vascular and myeloid cell ageing synergize, via IL-6 signalling, to accelerate atherosclerosis.

SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of oxygen therapy for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia (HAP or NP) in intensive care units (ICU). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and assessed data for methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The studies enrolled 151 participants with CAP or immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Overall, we found that non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the ICU, odd ratio (OR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.88; endotracheal intubation, OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; complications, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70; and shorten ICU length of stay, mean duration (MD) -3.28, 95% CI -5.41 to -1.61.Non-invasive ventilation and standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask were similar when measuring mortality in hospital, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.68; two-month survival, OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.28; duration of hospital stay, MD -1.00, 95% CI -2.05 to 0.05; and duration of mechanical ventilation, standard MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.14.

There were 2 cohorts, A and B (50 participants each) depending on whether child was diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 or not respectively during the study period. RESULTS: The assessment tool, PHQ\\\\9 showed a score of 10 in 13% (n = 13) participants (95%CI:7.1%C21.2%) in the entire cohort and in 16% (n = 8, 95%CI:5.8%C26.2%) and 10% (n = 5, 95%CI:1.7%C18.3%) participants in cohort A and cohort B respectively. GAD\\\\7 showed a score of 8 in 18% (n = 18) participants (95%CI:11.0%C27.0%) in the entire cohort and in 20% (n = 10, 95%CI:8.9%C31.1%) and 16% (n = 8, 95%CI:5.8%C26.2%) participants in cohort A and cohort B respectively. All participants were assessed, and supportive psychotherapeutic interventions administered over telephonic call. CONCLUSIONS: Primary caregivers should be assessed and followed up for psychological distress irrespective of other co\\\\existing factors. Robust support systems built over time could help withstand the exceptional strain of a major surge during a pandemic.","output":"Psychological distress in primary caregivers of children with cancer during COVID\\\\19 pandemic\\\\A single tertiary care center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the molecules of RNA which are greater than 200 nucleotides. They play a major role in pathological processes and the main role in cellular transcripts. In many viral infections, the lncRNAs are involved in viral gene expression enhancement, viral transformation, viral replication and so on. They actually cause many human diseases due to their alterations. The recent research of COVID-19 says that lncRNAs play important role in the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by up-regulated and down-regulated protein interactions. The life activities and the disease analysis at the molecular level can be easily analysed by identifying the lncRNAs of a particular disease. The new dimension to the architecture of molecular is added by the lncRNA, which gives a new pathway of opportunities for treatment and also help to know the actual cause of death by knowing the lncRNAs biological functions in the development of the disease. The main problem is identifying the lncRNAs from the huge number of RNA sequences accurately and quickly with sequence technologies is very difficult. Hence the computational identification of COVID-19 lncRNAs-protein interaction is urgently required. The COVID-19 lncRNAs can be easily identified by the recent advancement in computational prediction technology, i.e. machine learning and deep learning approaches which are branches of artificial intelligence (AI). This is a powerful tool to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes how the machine learning and deep learning methods can be used to identify the lncRNAs of COVID-19. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Identification of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Long Non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) Using Machine and Deep Learning Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The main goal of the COVIDENZA trial is to evaluate if inhibition of testosterone signalling by enzalutamide can improve the outcome of patients hospitalised for COVID-19. The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization. TRIAL DESIGN: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority. PARTICIPANTS: Included participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Ume? University Hospital, Region V?sterbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi?) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion). RANDOMISATION: Randomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + \\"standard of care\\": \\"standard of care\\"). The randomisation list, with consecutive subject numbers, was generated by an independent statistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed to have three phases. The first, an exploration phase of 45 participants (30 treatment and 15 control) will focus on safety and includes a more extensive laboratory assessment as well as more frequent safety evaluation. The second prolongation phase, includes the first 100 participants followed by an interim analysis to define the power of the study. The third phase is the continuation of the study up to maximum 600 participants included in total. TRIAL STATUS: The current protocol version is COVIDENZA v2.0 as of September 10, 2020. Recruitment started July 29, 2020 and is presently in safety pause after the first exploration phase. Recruitment is anticipated to be complete by 31 December 2021.

Remdesivir is the first antiviral compound approved by the US FDA for the SARS-CoV-2 treatment for emergency use, targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme. In this work, we have examined the action of remdesivir and other two ligands screened from the library of nucleotide analogues using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The MD simulations have been performed for all the ligand-bound RdRp complexes for the 30 ns time scale. This is one of the earlier reports to perform the MD simulations studies using the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp crystal structure (PDB ID 7BTF). The MD trajectories were analyzed and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations were performed to calculate the binding free energy. The binding energy data reveal that compound-17 (-59.6 kcal/mol) binds more strongly as compared to compound-8 (-46.3 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-29.7 kcal/mol) with RdRp. The detailed analysis of trajectories shows that the remdesivir binds in the catalytic site and forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic residues from 0 to 0.46 ns. Compound-8 binds in the catalytic site but does not form direct hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues. Compound-17 showed the formation of hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues throughout the simulation process. The MD simulation results such as hydrogen bonding, the center of mass distance analysis, snapshots at a different time interval, and binding energy suggest that compound-17 binds strongly with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and has the potential to develop as a new antiviral against COVID-19. Further, the frontier molecular orbital analysis and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) iso-surface analysis using DFT calculations shed light on the superior binding of compound-17 with RdRp compared to remdesivir and compound-8. The computed as well as the experimentally reported pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of compound-17 is encouraging and therefore can be one of the potential candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Revealing the Inhibition Mechanism of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 by Remdesivir and Nucleotide Analogues: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung complications during malaria infection can range from coughs and impairments in gas transfer to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infecting C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei K173 strain (PbK) resulted in pulmonary oedema, capillaries congested with leukocytes and infected red blood cells (iRBCs), and leukocyte infiltration into the lungs. This new model of malaria-associated lung pathology, without any accompanying cerebral complications, allows the investigation of mechanisms leading to the lung disease. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in alveolar epithelial cells is decreased by several respiratory tract pathogens and this is suggested to contribute to pulmonary oedema. We show that PbK, a pathogen that remains in the circulation, also decreased the activity and expression of ENaC, suggesting that infectious agents can have indirect effects on ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells. The reduced ENaC activity may contribute to the pulmonary oedema induced by PbK malaria.","output":"Reduced activity of the epithelial sodium channel in malaria-induced pulmonary oedema in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As academia begins to incorporate modern communication technologies into its scholarly structures, there are both enablers and barriers which foster academics uptake of these innovations. Those who are early adopters of academic social media - whether it be for education, research-related networking, or knowledge translation - may therefore be best positioned to highlight both enablers and barriers within their work environments. METHODS: The authors conducted a constructivist grounded theory study to discern what prominent practitioners of academic social media (e.g. Twitter) have encountered in their careers. Participants were recruited via a snowball sampling technique and invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Three investigators engaged in constant comparative analysis of incoming transcripts. To enhance rigour, we conducted an audit of the analysis and a participant member check. RESULTS: Seventeen emerging influencers in the field of academic social media were recruited. After axial coding, the 30 enablers and 21 barriers to academic social media use were mapped to three spheres of influence: personal, institutional, and virtual. The investigators propose a framework that organizes these enablers and barriers around a tipping point where sustainability becomes possible. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple enablers and barriers were described to influence social media users within academic medicine. By organizing these facets into a personal, institutional, and virtual framework along a spectrum, we can begin to understand the underlying structures that potentiate the academic ecosystems in which social media and similar innovations may flourish.","output":"Systems to support scholarly social media: a qualitative exploration of enablers and barriers to new scholarship in academic medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunization with naked genes (DNACimmunization) is a perspective modern approach to prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccination against pathogens, as well as cancer and allergy.

Despite this, it has been reported that a minority of people do not comply with the governmental guidelines. When considering the reasons why some people do not comply with preventive measures, previous studies have shown that beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories negatively predict responsible pandemic-related behaviour. This, in turn, could seriously undermine success in combating the pandemic. Our aim was, therefore, to further investigate the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and adherence to official COVID-19 medical guidelines by including mediating roles of beliefs in pseudoscientific information and trust in government officials. A total of 1882 adults from Croatia provided sociodemographic information and completed several scales related to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, beliefs in pseudoscientific information, trust in government officials, and adherence to official COVID-19 guidelines. A multiple mediation analysis revealed a direct negative effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on compliance with the preventive measures. In addition, conspiracy beliefs were indirectly related to compliance via trust in government officials. The present study builds upon emerging research showing that conspiracy beliefs may have significant social consequences and pose a potential risk to public health.

METHODS: From March 29th to April 15th 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques through Limesurvey platform. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for perceived job stress were concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR = 3.18 [95% CI = 2.00-5.05] P < .001), perceived impact on job demands (OR = 1.63 [95% CI = 1.05-2.52] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 2.50 [95% CI = 1.60-3.90] P < .001), and non-working concerns (OR = 1.86 [95% CI = 1.15-3.03] P < .05). With respect to the risk factors for rumination about the pandemic emerged concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR 1.74, [95% CI = 1.12-2.71] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 1.68 [95% CI = 1.12-2.52] P < .05), and impact on personal life (OR = 2.04 [95% CI = 1.08-3.86] P < .05).

However, few EDs have adequate time and personnel resources to deliver recommended evidence-based assessment and interventions. To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. METHODS: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n=14) or care as usual (control; n=17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. RESULTS: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants' app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.

Under Section 904(a)(3) of the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, tobacco manufacturing companies need to report on quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) in all tobacco products. While the extensive HPHC list of 2012 includes 93 chemicals, which are categorized as carcinogenic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or reproductive toxicants or addictive compounds, it fails to include microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) that have been shown to contribute to adverse health outcomes among tobacco users. Nevertheless, over the last 50 years, researchers have studied microorganisms in a variety of tobacco products using both culture-based and culture-independent techniques. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of this body of research, detailing the bacterial and fungal microbiomes residing in commercial tobacco products. Overall, studies have characterized over 89 unique bacterial genera and 19 fungal genera in cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, hookah, and smokeless tobacco. The most predominant bacterial genera are Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. Fungal genera identified have included Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Streptomyces, and Candida, to name a few. While some of the identified microorganisms are known human pathogens, others are potential opportunistic pathogens. Given the vast array of microorganisms that are present across diverse types of tobacco products, future research should be focused on the viability of these microorganisms, as well as their ability to transfer to the users respiratory tract, potentially contributing to adverse health outcomes.

The kinetics of miR-124/VAMP3 expression was first examined in vitro in microglial cells (primary microglia and BV2 microglial cells) following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

Manipulating miR-124/VAMP3 expression by using miR-124 mimics or VAMP3-specific siRNA in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells inhibited BV2 microglial activation-associated inflammatory cytokine release. To further examine the role of miR-124/VAMP3 in a surgical setting, we employed a rat surgical trauma model. Significant microglial activation and altered miR-124/VAMP3 expression were observed following surgical trauma. We also altered miR-124/VAMP3 expression in the rat surgical trauma model by administration of exogenous miR-124 and by using electroacupuncture, which is a clinically applicable treatment that modulates microglial function and minimizes postoperative disorders. We determined that electroacupuncture treatment specifically increases the expression of miR-124 in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Increased miR-124 expression with a concomitant decrease in VAMP3 expression resulted in decreased inflammatory cytokine release related to microglial activation post-surgery. Our study indicates that miR-124/VAMP3 is involved in surgery-induced microglial activation and that targeting miR-124/VAMP3 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for postoperative disorders involving microglial activation.","output":"miR-124/VAMP3 is a novel therapeutic target for mitigation of surgical trauma-induced microglial activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel 2-(3-(4-substituted aryl)guanidine-1-yl)-4-phenyl-6-(thiophene-2-yl)pyrimidines (7) were synthesized by simple condensation between chalcones with therapeutic biguanide derivatives The novel guanidinopyrimidine derivatives (7) were characterized by different spectral studies Furthermore, subject to ADMET prediction using pkSCM software and molecular docking studies against different kinds of novel RNA proteins such as, spike (PDB ID: 6XC3), main protease (3CLpro - PDB ID: 6LU7), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp - PDB ID: 6W9Q) and host protein ACE2 (PDB ID:1R42) spike protein and also the activities are compared with FDA-approved few human trial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HQC), favipiravir and lopinavir ? 2020 Ubiquity Press All rights reserved","output":"Synthesis, characterization, ADMET prediction and molecular docking studies against COVID-19 proteins of novel 2-(3- (4-substituted aryl)guanidine-1-yl)-4- phenyl-6-(thiophene-2-yl)pyrimidines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: As frontline workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should be well-prepared to fight the disease and prevent harm to their patients and themselves. Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of oncologists in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on them. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire disseminated to oncologists by SurveyMonkey. The tool had 42 questions that captured participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice; their experiences; and the pandemic's impact on various aspects of their lives. Participants from Middle East and North African countries, Brazil, and the Philippines completed the electronic survey between April 24 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,010 physicians who participated in the study, 54.75% were male and 64.95% were medical or clinical oncologists. The level of knowledge regarding the prevention and transmission of the virus was good in 52% of participants. The majority (92%) were worried about contracting the virus either extremely (30%) or mildly (62%), and 84.85% were worried about transmitting the virus to their families. Approximately 76.93% reported they would take the COVID 19 vaccine once available, with oncologists practicing in Brazil having the highest odds ratio of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 11.8, 95% CI, 5.96 to 23.38, P < .001). Participants reported a negative impact of the pandemic on relations with coworkers (15.84%), relations with family (27.84%), their emotional and mental well-being (48.51%), research productivity (34.26%), and financial income (52.28%).

We develop a method to quantify neighborhood activity behaviors at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social-distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effects of localized demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment density characteristics on infection rates and deaths in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities.","output":"Exposure density and neighborhood disparities in COVID-19 infection risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gestational weight gain has been associated with some adverse perinatal outcomes, but few studies have examined the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognition and their conclusions are inconsistent. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO number, CRD42017073266), we systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for studies examining association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills, without restriction in study design or language. Two reviewers extracted in an independent way the data. The Quality of Reporting of Observational Longitudinal Research scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. Effect size (ES) for adjusted models and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for (i) intelligence quotient, (ii) language related skills and (iii) mathematic related skills comparing offspring's cognitive skills when gestational weight gain was within recommendations (as reference) with those from mothers whose gestational weight gain was above or below the recommendations. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. There was a positive trend that associated gestational weight gain above recommendations with better offspring's intelligence quotient, although not statistically significant (ES 0.02, 95% CI -0.00, 0.05; I2 = 0.00%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a not significant positive association between gestational weight gain above recommendations and intelligence quotient and some studies reported associations between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills.

To address this, their empowerment C including their ability to express themselves and make decisions, is a key strategy. This study assessed how young peoples voice and choice concerning sex and relationships changed over the period of three years of implementation of the GUSO programme. Methods Data were collected through a household survey with young people (15C24 years) and through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews with youth and community stakeholders in 2017 for the baseline and 2020 for the end-line. Using the difference-in-difference technique and thematic analysis, changes in key outcomes were assessed over time between intervention and control area. Results There were limited changes over time in the intervention area, which did not differ from changes in the control area. Young people were able to express themselves and expand their decision-making space on sex and relationships, in particular if they were older, male and in a relationship. Young women negotiated their agency, often by engaging in transactional sex. However, youth were still restricted in their self-expression and their choices as speaking about sexuality was taboo, particularly with adults. This was influenced by the political and religious climate around SRHR in Uganda, which emphasised abstinence as the best option for young people to prevent SRHR-related problems. Conclusions Young peoples SRHR remains a challenge in Uganda in the context of a conservative political and religious environment. The limited effect of the programme on increasing young peoples voice and choice concerning relationships in Uganda can be understood in the context of a ban on CSE and the COVID-19 pandemic. These structural and emerging contextual factors enforce the taboo around youth sexuality and hinder their access to SRHR information and services.

This paper reports a study that analysed selected COVID art forms through arts and health and critical health psychology frameworks. Art forms produced between March and July 2020, and available in the public sphere - traditional media, social media and public spaces - were collated. The data consisted of comedy, cartoons, songs, murals and textile designs. Three key functions emerged from analysis: health promotion (comedy, cartoons, songs); disease prevention (masks); and improving the aesthetics of the healthcare environment (murals). Textile designs performed broader socio-cultural functions of memorialising and political advocacy. Similar to earlier HIV/AIDS and Ebola arts interventions in other African countries, these Ghanaian COVID art forms translated public health information on COVID-19 in ways that connected emotionally, created social awareness and improved public understanding. However, some art forms had limitations: for example, songs that edutained using fear-based strategies or promoting conspiracy theories on the origins and treatment of COVID-19, and state-sponsored visual art that represented public health messaging decoupled from socio-economic barriers to health protection. These were likely to undermine the public health communication goals of behaviour modification.

Methods: In this qualitative study, purposive sampling was used to select study participants by sharing the survey link on the Telegram application channels with an Iranian audience during COVID-19. The study was conducted from March to June 2020 and reached all Iranian provinces. We used qualitative content analysis to investigate specific concepts in the responses. Results: Of the 116 participants who responded to the survey, 34 (29.3%) were females, and 82 (70.7%) were male. The mean age of the participants was 34.8 years (standard deviation 9.9; range 17-71 years). Most of the participants (75.9%) reported having consumed alcohol, and 56.9% reported having self-medicated for an illness without a doctor's prescription before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common reason given for alcohol consumption was to relieve stress during home quarantining (32.3%). Based on analysis of the responses, two themes emerged: coping motivations and coping skills, with five subthemes and 14 basic codes. Coping motivations were more powerful than coping skills in relation to high alcohol consumption.

The present study aimed to describe the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients receiving different regimens of prophylactic anticoagulation. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective review using data from patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in Indianapolis, IN, United States. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized at international units Health Methodist Hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation between March 23, 2020, and April 8, 2020, who underwent ultrasound evaluation for venous thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. Nineteen of 45 patients (42.2%) were found to have deep venous thrombosis. Patients found to have deep venous thrombosis had no difference in time to intubation (p = 0.97) but underwent ultrasound earlier in their hospital course (p = 0.02). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar between the groups on day of intubation and day of ultrasound (p = 0.44 and p = 0.07, respectively). D-dimers were markedly higher in patients with deep venous thrombosis, both for maximum value and value on day of ultrasound (p < 0.01 for both). Choice of prophylactic regimen was not related to presence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.35). Ultrasound evaluation is recommended if D-dimer is greater than 2,000 ng/mL (sensitivity 95%, specificity 46%) and empiric anticoagulation considered if D-dimer is greater than 5,500 ng/mL (sensitivity 53%, specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep venous thrombosis is very common in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in incidence of deep venous thrombosis among different pharmacologic prophylaxis regimens, although our analysis is limited by small sample size.

We found that, in comparison to the Sweep Algorithm, Deep Reinforcement Learning can provide decision-makers with more efficient routing.

We reviewed patients with positive cultures from urine, blood, sputum, and sterile sites. Patients with positive cultures had cases reviewed to determine if they represented a true infection, defined by CDC criteria.

As the pandemic has spread, the low availability of medical equipment has increased, especially mechanical ventilators. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) claimed to have only 40,508 mechanical ventilators, which would be insufficient to support the Brazilian population at the pandemic peak. This lack of ventilators, especially in public hospitals, required quick, assertive, and effective actions to minimize the health crisis. This work provides an overview of the rapid deployment of a network for maintaining disused mechanical ventilators in public and private healthcare units in some regions of Brazil during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data referring to the processes of maintaining equipment, acquiring parts, and conducting national and international training were collected and analyzed. In total, 4047 ventilators were received by the maintenance sites, and 2516 ventilators were successfully repaired and returned to the healthcare units, which represents a success rate of 62.17%. The results show that the maintenance initiative directly impacted the availability and reliability of the equipment, allowing access to ventilators in the public and private health system and increasing the capacity of beds during the pandemic.","output":"Collaborative and Structured Network for Maintenance of Mechanical Ventilators during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Several recent studies have found that fluvoxamine decreases the risk of serious disease progression among people with early COVID-19.

One possible therapeutic procedure for these patients is the application of the prone position (PP). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of VV-ECMO on arterial oxygenation and compliance of the respiratory system in mechanically ventilated patients with refractory hypoxemia. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of prone position for ECMO. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of all 23 COVID-19 patients on ECMO who were placed for the first time in prone position with an average duration of 16 h.

Number of performed COVID-19 tests has a strong correlation with country-specific incidence (p <210-16) and mortality rate (p = 5.110-8). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.610-15 and 7.010-4, respectively), country-specific duration of the outbreak (2.610-4 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.810-4) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed.

Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p = 0.028). We rank countries by COVID-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile.

In a prospective, Zambian cohort, we examined the effect of tracing on return to care within 2 years of LTFU. METHODS: We traced a stratified, random sample of LTFU patients who had received HIV care between August 2013 and July 2015. LTFU was defined as a gap of >90 days from last scheduled appointment in the routine electronic medical record. Extracting 2 years of follow\\\\up visit data through 2017, we identified patients who returned. Using random selection for tracing as an instrumental variable (IV), we used conditional two\\\\stage least squares regression to estimate the local average treatment effect of tracer contact on return. We examined the observational association between tracer contact and return among patient sub\\\\groups self\\\\confirmed as disengaged from care. RESULTS: Of the 24,164 LTFU patients enumerated, 4380 were randomly selected for tracing and 1158 were contacted by a tracer within a median of 14.8 months post\\\\loss. IV analysis found that patients contacted by a tracer because they were randomized to tracing were no more likely to return than those not contacted (adjusted risk difference [aRD]: 3%, 95% CI: C2%, 8%, p = 0.23). Observational data showed that among contacted, disengaged patients, the rate of return was higher in the week following tracer contact (IR 5.74, 95% CI: 3.78C8.71) than in the 2 weeks to 1\\\\month post\\\\contact (IR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.40C3.72).

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, tracer contact did not causally increase LTFU patient return to HIV care, demonstrating the limited impact of tracing in this program, where contact occurred months after patients were LTFU. However, observational data suggest that tracing may speed return among some LTFU patients genuinely out\\\\of\\\\care.

METHODS: We searched Cochrane Library, Pubmed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCIEXPANDED, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI (Chinese Database), WanFang (Chinese Database), CBM (Chinese Database), VIP (Chinese Database) for studies published from November 1, 2019 to October 1, 2020, and we searched references of identified articles. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 7681 patients were included. We meta-analyzed the bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism risk between no anticoagulation and prophylactic anticoagulation, and found no significant difference. The same trend occurred in the comparison between with and without anticoagulation. However, when compared with no anticoagulation, both prophylactic anticoagulation (odd ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69C0.93) and therapeutic anticoagulation (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80C1.05) had lower risk of mortality. Furthermore, the risk of overall bleeding among patients with therapeutic anticoagulation was 3.11 times (95% CI: 2.29C4.24) than that of patients with prophylactic anticoagulation. On the contrary, therapeutic anticoagulation had lower risk of deep vein thrombosis than prophylactic anticoagulation (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.19C0.63). CONCLUSIONS: Among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, preventive and therapeutic anticoagulation were more beneficial than no anticoagulation for reducing mortality rate.

They were members of different police departments, and the epidemic-related activities became part of their everyday tasks, so they had colourful experiences. In the research we used a 14 question survey form compiled by us. The query happened online during the period of their professional examinations (the end of May - the beginning of June 2020);we got 28 answered questions about the experiences of policing the pandemic. The results showed that the tasks were checking official home quarantine, duty at border crossing points and duty on public places related to the lockdown. The vast majority of the interviewed (85.7 per cent) did not feel these tasks emotionally overwhelming, while a little bigger part of them rated the duties physically overwhelming (28.6 per cent). We asked about their fears, too. The most intense fear was the infection of their family members, it was followed by infecting others and the infection of colleagues, but they did not feel intense fear about becoming infected. Based on the results, we can probably say that the first two months of policing the pandemic did not mean extreme psychological overload.

METHODS: All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. RESULTS: Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. CONCLUSION: A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent visits were canceled without rescheduling.

(Miller 2016, 139) These questions, and the role of deconstruction as an analytic resource with which to answer them, are all the more urgent today. The already overwhelming threat of global warming that Miller was considering in 2015 (which has provoked unprecedented wild fires and floods around the world), is now accompanied by a global pestilence of historic proportions. Yet notwithstanding these crises, a significant number of people (particularly in North America) appear to have pre-emptively rejected the vaccine that has not yet been developed to prevent the SARS- COV-2 virus. An eq ually significant number refuse to make even the most basic efforts to limit its spread. Instead, taking a page out of the 'anti- vaccination playbook' (Ireland 2020), anti-masking groups in Canada, the US, and elsewhere are protesting against physical distancing, mandated mask-wearing, Contact tracing, and other proposed public health measures. Objections are made on the false grounds that non- medical face masks are harmful to health, and that the severity of the COVID-19 disease is misleadingly overstated.","output":"Lies in the Time of COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many local regions, the population is decreasing because of outflow of young people to city areas and the declining birth rate and aging population, so a tourism promotion is expected as a method of regional activation But it is difficult to invite tourists to a minor local region by a common tourism promotion Further the tourism industry must response to COVID-19 and large-scale natural disasters that have frequently occurred in recent years In this study, we propose a bicycle tourism system using LPWA communication helping to travel around tourist destinations safely and efficiently Basics of the bicycle tourism system was developed and investigated the possibility and usefulness ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Proposal of a Smart Bicycle Tourism Improving Tourability and Safety for Tourists by Mesh LPWA Communication System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Several studies explored the effects of exposure to radiofrequency-electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) EMF emitted from mobile phones on meningioma among adults. However, the results could not reach an agreement. This meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between adult meningioma risk and the use of a wireless phone. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase up to August 2018. The random- or fixed-effects model was used to combine the results depending on the heterogeneity of the analysis. The publication bias was evaluated using Egger's regression asymmetry test. The subgroup analysis was performed by time since the first use of wireless phone and laterality (ipsilateral/contralateral). Results: Eight studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the ever use of wireless phone led to a borderline decreased adult meningioma risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.99] with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 5.3%; p = 0.391). A decreased risk of meningioma was seen in short-term (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) users. Neither decreased nor increased risk of meningioma was observed in mid-term (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.75-1.16) and long-term (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.93-1.19) users.

The pollution level of six organophosphorus pesticides, three herbicides, and one bactericide in groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) and a hospital were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the ten detected pesticides ranged from not detected (ND) to 323.44 ng L-1 in different water samples from Beijing; metalaxyl was detected to have the highest concentration (89.58 ng L-1), and the detection frequencies of atrazine and metalaxyl were 100%. The maximum concentrations of pesticides in the Wenyu River, STPs, and the hospital were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by the treatment processes were observed for ametryn (100%), while the removal efficiencies for atrazine and omethoate were the lowest in the three STPs (- 9.6% and 12.67%, respectively). Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined for typical urban to assess the ecology and health effects. In the case of environmental toxicity, the highest RQ values (> 1) were obtained for dichlorvos and omethoate.

We evaluate the short-term changes to household economic status and assess womens access to health care during the first wave of COVID-19 in nationally representative samples of women aged 15C49 in Kenya and Burkina Faso, and in sub-nationally representative samples of women aged 15C49 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and Lagos, Nigeria. We examine prevalence and distribution of household income loss, food insecurity, and access to health care during the COVID-19 lockdowns across residence and pre-pandemic wealth categories. We then regress pre-pandemic individual and household sociodemographic characteristics on the three outcomes. RESULTS: In three out of four samples, over 90% of women reported partial or complete loss of household income since the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions. Prevalence of food insecurity ranged from 17.0% (95% CI 13.6C20.9) to 39.8% (95% CI 36.0C43.7), and the majority of women in food insecure households reported increases in food insecurity during the COVID-19 restriction period. In contrast, we did not find significant barriers to accessing health care during COVID restrictions. Between 783% and 940% of women who needed health care were able successfully access it. When we examined pre-pandemic sociodemographic correlates of the outcomes, we found that the income shock of COVID-19 was substantial and distributed similarly across wealth groups, but food insecurity was concentrated among poorer households.

This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the efficacy and safety of baloxavir compared to other antivirals for influenza in otherwise healthy patients. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed on 14 November 2016 in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and ICHUSHI to identify randomized controlled trials assessing antivirals for influenza. A NMA including 22 trials was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of baloxavir with other antivirals. RESULTS The time to alleviation of all symptoms was significantly shorter for baloxavir compared to zanamivir (difference in median time 19.96 h; 95% CrI [3.23, 39.07]). The time to cessation of viral shedding was significantly shorter for baloxavir than zanamivir and oseltamivir (47.00 h; 95% CrI [28.18, 73.86] and 56.03 h [33.74, 87.86], respectively). The mean decline in virus titer from baseline to 24 h was significantly greater for baloxavir than for the other drugs. Other differences in efficacy outcomes were not significant. No significant differences were found between baloxavir and the other antivirals for safety, except total drug-related adverse events where baloxavir demonstrated a decrease compared to oseltamivir and laninamivir. CONCLUSIONS The NMA suggests that baloxavir demonstrated better or similar efficacy results compared to other antivirals with a comparable safety profile. Baloxavir led to a significant decrease in viral titer versus zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir and decreased viral shedding versus zanamivir and oseltamivir.","output":"A network meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil versus neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza in otherwise healthy patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While degraded trust and cohesion within a country are often shown to have large socio-economic impacts, they can also have dramatic consequences when compliance is required for collective survival We illustrate this point in the context of the COVID-19 crisis Policy responses all over the world aim to reduce social interaction and limit contagion Using data on human mobility and political trust at regional level in Europe, we examine whether the compliance to these containment policies depends on the level of trust in policy makers prior to the crisis Using a double difference approach around the time of lockdown announcements, we find that high-trust regions decrease their mobility related to non-necessary activities significantly more than low-trust regions We also exploit country and time variation in treatment using the daily strictness of national policies The efficiency of policy stringency in terms of mobility reduction significantly increases with trust The trust effect is nonlinear and increases with the degree of stringency We assess how the impact of trust on mobility potentially translates in terms of mortality growth rate","output":"Trust and Compliance to Public Health Policies in Times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a surge of rhino-orbital mucormycosis cases in India in the wake of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To decrease transmission in such cases, reactive interventions target household members of clinical malaria cases, with the intervention unit (e.g., the household/s) derived from an epidemiological and operational perspective. A lack of unanimity regarding the spatial range of the intervention unit calls for greater importance to be placed on social context in conceptualizing the appropriate unit. A novel malaria elimination strategy based on reactive treatment was recently evaluated by a cluster randomized trial in a low transmission setting in The Gambia. Transdisciplinary research was used to assess and improve the effectiveness of the intervention which consisted, among others, of reflecting on whether the household was the most adequate unit of analysis. The intervention was piloted on the smallest treatment unit possible and was further adapted following a better understanding of the social and epidemiological context. Intervention units defined according to (i) shared sleeping spaces and (ii) household membership, showed substantial limitations as it was not possible to define them clearly and they were extremely variable within the study setting. Incorporating local definitions and community preference in the trial design led to the appropriate intervention unitthe compounddefined as an enclosed space containing one or several households belonging to the same extended patrilineal family.

This retrospective observational study examined whether glycemic control before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) onset contributes to progression from non-severe to severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured on hospital admission in 415 patients with non-severe COVID-19. The outcome was determined from time of hospital admission to severe progression, based on clinical practice guidelines for COVID-19 in Japan. RESULTS The median value for HbA1c on admission was 6.1%, with diabetes present in 138 patients (33.3%). Among the total cohort, 93 (22.4%) progressed to severe COVID-19 with a median (interquartile range) time of four (3-7) days, while 322 (77.6%) were discharged after 13 (10-17) days. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that HbA1c level on admission was independently associated with progression to severe COVID-19 (hazard ratio for 1% increase 1.237, 95% confidence interval 1.037-1.475; p=0.018), with findings consistent among several sensitivity analyses. In subgroup analyses, such an association was significant in patients with diabetes as well as older age, current smoking habit, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher C-reactive protein level, moderate II COVID-19, dyslipidemia, and chronic respiratory disease, with no remarkable inconsistency among the subgroups. Finally, higher HbA1c level (7%) was more strongly associated with severe COVID-19 progression than diabetes. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that poor glycemic control before COVID-19 onset contributes to progression from non-severe to severe COVID-19, even in patients with severe COVID-19 risk factors regardless of presence of diabetes.","output":"Glycated hemoglobin level on admission associated with progression to severe disease in hospitalized patients with non-severe coronavirus disease 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Maternity harassment, known in English as pregnancy discrimination, remains prevalent in developed countries. However, research examining the mental health effects of maternity harassment is lacking. We aimed to examine the association between maternity harassment and depression during pregnancy in Japan. METHODS: A cross-sectional Internet survey was conducted on 359 pregnant employees (including women who were working at the time their pregnancy was confirmed) from May 22 to May 31, 2020, during which time a COVID-19 state of emergency was declared. Maternity harassment was defined as being subjected to any of the 16 adverse treatments prohibited by national guidelines. Depression was defined as a score of &#8805;9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Japanese version). Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% of the pregnant employees had experienced maternity harassment by supervisors and/or colleagues. After adjusting for demographics, pregnancy status, work status, and fear of COVID-19, pregnant employees who experienced maternity harassment were more likely to have depression than those who did not (odds ratio 2.48, 95% confidential interval 1.34-4.60). This association was not influenced by whether they were teleworking or not as a COVID-19 measure. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of pregnant employees experienced maternity harassment and had a higher prevalence of depression than those who did not.

This study characterized the immune cell landscape and blood transcriptomic profile of patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) to identify the potential therapeutic biomarkers. METHODS: The blood transcriptome profile of patients with PTB and controls were used for fractionating immune cell populations with the CIBERSORT algorithm and then to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with R/Bioconductor packages. Later, systems biology investigations (such as semantic similarity, gene correlation, and graph theory parameters) were implemented to prioritize druggable genes contributing to the immune cell alterations in patients with TB. Finally, real time-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm gene expression levels. RESULTS: Patients with PTB had higher levels of four immune subpopulations like CD8(+) T cells (P = 1.9  10(?8)), natural killer (NK) cells resting (P = 6.3  10(?5)), monocytes (P = 6.4  10(?6)), and neutrophils (P = 1.6  10(?7)).

Evaluation of early SC2 strains suggested limited viral genetic diversity. However, genetic and epidemiologic investigations in the interim have revealed impressive genetic variability. Many of these viral variants are now defined as variants of concern (VOC) based on genetic alterations in their spike (S) and other proteins that cause enhanced transmissibility, decreased susceptibility to antibody neutralization or therapeutics and or their ability to induce severe disease. The delta ({delta}) and omicron (o) variants are particularly problematic based on their impressive and unprecedented transmissibility and ability to cause break through infections. The delta variant also accumulates at high concentrations in host tissues and has caused waves of lethal disease. SC2 infection is mediated by S protein binding to cellular ACE2 receptors and subsequent S protein protease processing. Because studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) stimulates ACE2 and S priming proteases, studies were undertaken to determine if interventions that target CHI3L1 are effective inhibitors of SC2 viral variant infection. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 augments epithelial cell infection by pseudoviruses that express the alpha, beta, gamma, delta or omicron S proteins and that the CHI3L1 inhibitors anti-CHI3L1 and kasugamycin inhibit epithelial cell infection by these VOC pseudovirus moieties. Thus, CHI3L1 is a universal, VOC-independent therapeutic target in COVID 19.","output":"Host Chitinase 3-like-1 is a Universal Therapeutic Target for the Delta, Omicron and Other SARS-CoV-2 Viral Variants in COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a new coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-is a pandemic with major impacts on the health care sector, and a broad view of the disease is of fundamental importance for any radiologist The purpose of this review is to address the main clinical and imaging aspects of COVID-19, as well as guidelines for requesting and using imaging methods;measures to protect patients and health care professionals;systems for quantifying pulmonary findings and preparing integrated reports;and the main innovations that have emerged during this pandemic Resumo A COVID-19, doen?a causada por um novo coronavrus (SARS-CoV-2),  uma pandemia que tem causado grandes impactos no setor de sade, sendo fundamental para o mdico radiologista uma vis?o ampla da doen?a O objetivo desta revis?o  abordar os principais aspectos clnicos e imaginolgicos da COVID-19, assim como as diretrizes para solicitao e utilizao dos mtodos de imagem, medidas de proteo a pacientes e profissionais de sade, sistemas de quantificao dos achados pulmonares e de elaborao de relatrios integrados e as principais inovaes que tm surgido neste momento de pandemia","output":"COVID-19: a brief update for radiologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents the mechanisms for adapting innovation processes in corporations in the context of COVID-19 and demonstrates technologies and solutions that can be applied to meet current challenges Innovation can become the link in the company that will help to survive the crisis and open up opportunities for identification, analysis and testing new products and processes The use of new technologies and openness to innovations can be a decisive factor for staying ahead of the competition in the future The paper performs examples of successful startups/companies that were able to competently and timely rebuild their business, and provides examples of government initiatives that share their approaches and valuable tips on how to continue innovating even in the current unprecedented times The research was based on the coronavirus' impact analysis on various industries using leading industry data sources, analytical reports, international indexes and indicators ?

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone app (iaya) intervention that was designed to create an engaged community of young adult patients and help them learn emotional coping skills. METHODS: For this single-group pilot trial, 25 young adult patients aged 18-39 years who were receiving active cancer treatment were asked to use the iaya app for 12 weeks. To collect app use data, we used Mixpanel, an analytics platform for apps. Feasibility was assessed through rates of app sessions and the number of coping exercises engaged, and intervention acceptability was evaluated by using an app usability questionnaire and through qualitative interviews at study completion. We collected patient-reported outcome data at baseline and at week 12 to explore self-efficacy for coping with cancer, self-efficacy for managing emotions, perceived emotional support, and quality of life. RESULTS: Baseline patient-reported outcome data indicated that participants scored relatively low on perceived emotional support but reasonably high on self-efficacy for coping with cancer and managing emotions as well as quality of life. Participants had a mean of 13 app sessions (SD 14) and 2 coping exercises (SD 3.83) in 12 weeks. Only 9% (2/23) of participants met our combined feasibility definition of 10 app sessions and 3 coping skills from different categories. The participants mean usability score was 73.7% (SD 10.84), which exceeded our predefined threshold of 70%, and qualitative feedback was generally positive. CONCLUSIONS: Although perceived acceptable by patients, the iaya smartphone app did not meet the a priori feasibility criteria as a stand-alone app intervention.

METHODS: We projected intensive care unit (ICU) needs and capacity from August 2020 to January 2021 using the South African National COVID-19 Epi Model. We assessed cost-effectiveness of 1) administration of dexamethasone to ventilated patients and remdesivir to non-ventilated patients, 2) dexamethasone alone to both non-ventilated and ventilated patients, 3) remdesivir to non-ventilated patients only, and 4) dexamethasone to ventilated patients only; all relative to a scenario of standard care. We estimated costs from the healthcare system perspective in 2020 USD, deaths averted, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratios of each scenario. RESULTS: Remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated patients was estimated to result in 408 [uncertainty range: 229-1891] deaths averted (assuming no efficacy [uncertainty range: 0-70%] of remdesivir) compared to standard care, and save $15 million. The result was driven by the efficacy of dexamethasone, and the reduction of ICU-time required for patients treated with remdesivir. The scenario of dexamethasone alone to non-ventilated and ventilated patients requires additional $159,000 and averts 689 [uncertainty range: 330-1118] deaths, resulting in $231 per death averted, relative to standard care. CONCLUSIONS: The use of remdesivir for non-ventilated patients and dexamethasone for ventilated is likely to be cost-saving compared to standard care by reducing ICU days.

Massive efforts are being made to find a therapeutic solution in the shortest possible time. However, the research community is becoming increasingly concerned about taking a shortsighted strategy without contemplating the long-term consequences. For example, It has been reported that only 8.4% of total COVID-19 patients develop a secondary bacterial infection. In comparison, 74.6% of them are administered with antibiotics as prophylactic treatment. We contend that overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics increases the likelihood of AMR development and negatively affects the patient's recovery due to the prevalence of the \\"gut-lung axis.\\". Consequently, the use of antibiotics to treat COVID-19 patients must be rationalized, or an alternative treatment must be sought that does not risk contributing to AMR development and positively impacts the treatment outcomes. Phage therapy, a century-old concept, is one of the most promising approaches that can be adapted to serve this purpose. This review emphasizes the negative impact of excessive antibiotic use in COVID-19 treatment and provides an overview of how phage therapy can be used as an alternative treatment option. We have argued that targeted killing (narrow spectrum) and anti-inflammatory (which can target the primary cause of mortality in COVID-19) properties of phages can be an effective alternative to antibiotics.","output":"Phage therapy in the Covid-19 era: Advantages over antibiotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We sought to create a novel physician assistant (PA) and physician hospital medicine co-management strategy, employing a 3:1 PA:physician structure, under which the physician oversees all PA patients, but without a separate independent panel.

The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for severe COVID\\\\19, requiring hospitalization in patients with IRD. This is a multicenter nested case control study conducted in the Netherlands. Cases are hospital known patients with IRD requiring hospitalization for COVID\\\\19 between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. Controls are hospital known patients with IRD not requiring hospitalization for COVID\\\\19 in this period, included at a 4:1 ratio.

However, doubts were raised on their efficacy and adverse effects. Globally, it was agreed that the first recipients for vaccines would be the health care workers (HCWs). Logically, it was bound to raise some concerns and result in hesitancy among the HCWs. Aims: The current study was planned to study the proportion of HCWs having hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination and factors effecting it. Settings and Design: Cross-sectional study conducted among HCWs of Uttar Pradesh. Methods and Material: The survey was conducted both in online and offline mode and attempted by 254 HCWs eligible for receiving COVID-19 vaccine. Statistical analysis used: t-test, chi-square test, proportion, mean, SD Results: Vaccine hesitancy was present in 35.8% HCWs. Only social factors like caste (p=0.023) and religion (p<0.001) were found to be significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Gender, type of health worker, fear of COVID-19 infection, fear of lethality or pre-existing diseases did not affect vaccine hesitancy. The maximum number of HCWs (71.4%) were hesitant because they were unsure of the side-effects followed by the reason of being unsure about its effect on their own health (53.8%). When asked about their attitude towards compulsory COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs, should it be made mandatory by the government, 42.9% were in favour and 40.6% were against any such mandate.

The complex nature of planning, collaborating, and upholding partnerships present administrative difficulties on top of budgetary constrains. These lead to limited opportunities for students to gain international experiences and for researchers to propagate educational and practical insights. This paper presents an empirical view on three different course structures conducted by the same research and educational team over a four-year time span. The courses were managed in Japan and Germany, facing cultural challenges, time-zone differences, language barriers, heterogeneous and homogeneous team structures, amongst others. Three semesters were carried out before and one during the Covid-19 pandemic. Implications for a recent focus on online education for software engineering education and future directions are discussed. As administrational and institutional differences typically do not guarantee the same number of students on all sides, distributed teams can be 1. balanced, where the number of students on one side is less than double the other, 2. unbalanced, where the number of students on one side is significantly larger than double the other, or 3. one-sided, where one side lacks students altogether. An approach for each of these three course structures is presented and discussed. Empirical analyses and reoccurring patterns in global software engineering education are reported. In the most recent three global software engineering classes, students were surveyed at the beginning and the end of the semester. The questionnaires ask students to rank how impactful they perceive factors related to global software development such as cultural aspects, team structure, language, and interaction.

Human clinical pain models are central tools, in the investigation of basic physiologic pain responses, and can be applied in patients as well as in healthy volunteers. Each clinical pain model investigates different aspects of the human pain response. Brief thermal sensitization induces a mild burn injury, resulting in development of primary hyperalgesia at the site of stimulation, and secondary hyperalgesia surrounding the site of stimulation. Central sensitization is believed to play an important role in the development of secondary hyperalgesia; however, a possible association of secondary hyperalgesia following brief thermal sensitization and other heat pain models remains unknown. Our aim with this study is to investigate how close the heat pain detection threshold is associated with the size of the area of secondary hyperalgesia induced by the clinical heat pain model: Brief thermal sensitization. METHODS AND DESIGN We aim to include 120 healthy participants. The participants will be tested on two separate study days with the following procedures: i) Brief thermal sensitization, ii) heat pain detection threshold and iii) pain during thermal stimulation. Additionally, the participants will be tested with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires. We conducted statistical simulations based on data from our previous study, to estimate an empirical power of 99.9 % with  of 0.05. We define that an R(2) < 0.25 and predictive intervals larger than +/-150 cm(2) are indications of a weak association. DISCUSSION The area of secondary hyperalgesia may serve as a quantitative measure of the central sensitization induced by cutaneous heat stimulation, and thus may be a biomarker of an individual's pain sensitivity. The number of studies investigating secondary hyperalgesia is growing; however basic knowledge of the physiologic aspects of secondary hyperalgesia in humans is still incomplete.

This process of natural vaccination is immensely pertinent to the current context of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection around the globe. The conventional idea of herd immunity is based on efficient transmission of pathogens and developing natural immunity within a population. This is entirely encouraging while fighting against any disease in pandemic circumstances. A spatial community is occupied by people having variable resistance capacity against a pathogen. Protection efficacy against once very common diseases like smallpox, poliovirus or measles has been possible only because of either natural vaccination through contagious infections or expanded immunization programs among communities. This has led to achieving herd immunity in some cohorts. The microbiome plays an essential role in developing the body's immune cells for the emerging competent vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. Frequency of interaction among microbiota, metabolic nutrients and individual immunity preserve the degree of vaccine effectiveness against several pathogens. Microbiome symbiosis regulates pathogen transmissibility and the success of vaccination among different age groups. Imbalance of nutrients perturbs microbiota and abrogates immunity. Thus, a particular population can become vulnerable to the infection. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to environmental enteropathy (EE). As a consequence, the generation of herd immunity can either be delayed or not start in a particular cohort. Moreover, disparities of the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries outside of developed countries are due to inconsistencies of healthy microbiota among the individuals. We suggested that pan-India poliovirus vaccination program, capable of inducing herd immunity among communities for the last 30 years, may also influence the inception of natural course of heterologous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, this anamnestic recall is somewhat counterintuitive, as antibody generation against original antigens of SARS-CoV-2 will be subdued due to original antigenic sin.","output":"Impact of Microbiota: A Paradigm for Evolving Herd Immunity against Viral Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a severe reduction in operative opportunities for trainees.

Methods A lung transplantation virtual technical skills course was developed. Surgical fellows were provided with a bench model and surgical instruments. Using a virtual communication platform, teaching sessions were held twice weekly, and fellows performed an anastomosis on camera. Video recordings were reviewed and critiqued by attending staff. At the end of the 3-month course, participants were surveyed about their experience. Warm ischaemic time was compared between fellows five most recent cases before and after the pandemic.

RADICA's versatility is validated against other targets such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from human B cells and patients' serum. RADICA can accurately detect and absolutely quantify EBV DNA with similar dynamic range of 0.5-2100 copies/L (R2 value > 0.98) in 1 h without thermal cycling, providing a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based detection.

KNO(3) treatment improved the bioactive compound activities of Medicago sprouts by increasing total phenolic and flavonoid contents and enhancing the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Furthermore, species-specific responses toward KNO(3) priming were noticeable, where Medicago interexta showed the highest antioxidant and antidiabetic activities, followed by Medicago polymorpha. Overall, this study sheds the light on the physiological and biochemical bases of growth, metabolism, and tissue quality improvement impact of KNO(3) on Medicago sprouts.","output":"Impact of Sprouting under Potassium Nitrate Priming on Nitrogen Assimilation and Bioactivity of Three Medicago Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A considerable number of patients with stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) will relapse within 5 years after surgery, which is a leading cause of death in early-stage CRC. The current TNM stage system is limited due to the heterogeneous clinical outcomes displayed in patients of same stage. Therefore, searching for a novel tool to identify patients at high recurrence-risk for improving post-operative individual management is an urgent need. Methods: Using four independent public cohorts and qRT-PCR data from 66 tissues, we developed and validated a recurrence-associated immune signature (RAIS) based on global immune genes. The clinical and molecular features, tumor immune microenvironment landscape, and immune checkpoints profiles of RAIS were also investigated. Results: In five independent cohorts, this novel scoring system was proven to be an independent recurrent factor and displayed excellent discrimination and calibration in predicting the recurrence-risk at 1~5 years. Further analysis revealed that the high-risk group displayed high mutation rate of TP53, while the low-risk group had more abundance of activated CD4+/CD8+ T cells and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1. Conclusions: The RAIS model is highly predictive of recurrence in patients with stage II/III CRC, which might serve as a powerful tool to further optimize decision-making in adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as tailor surveillance protocol for individual patients.","output":"Clinical Significance and Inflammatory Landscape of aNovel Recurrence-Associated Immune Signature in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic agents including lyssa-, henipah-, SARS-like corona-, Marburg-, Ebola-, and astroviruses.

Although medical students are at increased occupational risk for HBV infection, little is known about the burden of HBV infection amongst medical students in Sierra Leone. METHODS: As part of a screening and vaccination campaign, a cross-sectional study on prevalence of HBV among medical students in Freetown was conducted in December 2019. Antigen point of care test was used for HBV screening and data on students' risk history and demographics were collected. Additionally, for students diagnosed positive with HBV, linkage to care and initial assessment data after diagnosis was collected from the HBV clinic they were linked to. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-seven medical students (77.3%) from year three to six were screened for HBV infection. Almost all students (98.1%) had never been vaccinated against HBV and more than half (56.7%) reported a history of needle stick injuries. The prevalence of HBV infection (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity) was 10.2% (n = 16). Among HBsAg positive students, 75% (n = 12) were successfully enrolled at chronic HBV clinic within three months of diagnosis. Only one student had evidence of liver cirrhosis and was started on treatment with Tenofovir diproxil fumarate.

Hence, this study is aimed at assessing the level of preparedness for COVID-19 and its associated factors among frontline healthcare providers in South Gondar public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 207 selected healthcare providers who were working in South Gondar public hospital from July 08 to August 29, 2020. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The healthcare providers were selected through simple random sampling techniques. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions with a 95% confidence interval were fitted with 95% CI to establish the associated factors with a low level of preparedness. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall level of preparedness among healthcare providers for COVID-19 was found to be 41.3% (95% CI: 37.4, 44.7). Only 81 (40.1%) healthcare providers had prepared for telling their family and friends if they are infected with COVID-19. Besides, only 23.8% of healthcare providers obtained alcohol-based hand sanitizer in every patient room. Factors associated with a low level of preparedness include being male (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.22C4.94), unmarried (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.44C8.00), and working experience less than five years (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.29-9.09). CONCLUSION: The level of preparedness among frontline healthcare providers towards COVID-19 was found to be very low.

Three cases of Parkinsons disease (PD) have been reported as a direct consequence of COVID-19. In spite of the scarce data for establishing a definitive link between COVID-19 and PD, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cases reported. They, however, do not fit well with the clinical findings reported for COVID-19 patients, in general, and for the PD cases reported, in particular. Given the importance of this potential connection, we present here a molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis that explains well these findings and will serve to explore the potential CNS damage in COVID-19 patients. The model explaining the cascade effects from COVID-19 to CNS is developed by using bioinformatic tools. It includes the post-translational modification of host proteins in the lungs by viral proteins, the transport of modified host proteins via exosomes out the lungs, and the disruption of protein-protein interaction in the CNS by these modified host proteins. Our hypothesis is supported by finding 44 proteins significantly expressed in the CNS which are associated with PD and whose interactions can be perturbed by 24 host proteins significantly expressed in the lungs. These 24 perturbators are found to interact with viral proteins and to form part of the cargoes of exosomes in human tissues. The joint set of perturbators and PD-vulnerable proteins form a tightly connected network with significantly more connections than expected by selecting a random cluster of proteins of similar size from the human proteome. The molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis presented here provides several routes for the cascading of effects from the lungs of COVID-19 patients to PD. In particular, the disruption of autophagy/ubiquitination processes appears as an important mechanism that triggers the generation of large amounts of exosomes containing perturbators in their cargo, which would insult several PD-vulnerable proteins, potentially triggering Parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Cascading from SARS-CoV-2 to Parkinsons Disease through Protein-Protein Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All positive-strand (+) RNA viruses assemble membrane-associated replication complexes (RCs) for viral RNA synthesis in virus-infected cells. However, how these multi-component RCs assemble and function in synthesizing, processing, and transporting viral RNAs to the cytosol remains poorly defined. Here, we determined both the structure of the core RNA replicase of chikungunya virus (family Togaviridae) at a near-atomic level and the native RC architecture in its cellular context at the subnanometer resolution, using in vitro reconstitution and in situ electron cryotomography, respectively. Within the core RNA replicase (nsP1+2+4), the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4, in complex with nsP2 helicase-protease, was found to co-fold with the membrane-anchored nsP1 RNA-capping dodecameric ring and is located asymmetrically within nsP1 central pore. This complex forms the minimal core RNA replicase, while the addition of a large cytoplasmic ring next to the C-terminus of nsP1 forms the holo-RNA-RC as observed at the neck of spherules formed in virus-infected cells. These results represent a major conceptual advance in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of RNA virus replication and the principles underlying the molecular architecture of RCs, likely to be shared with many pathogenic (+) RNA viruses.

However, hematology practices have been slower to adopt telemedicine due to traditional care models that rely on interdisciplinary regional care centers and their ability to provide comprehensive and centralized services. Patients have traditionally been able to access high-quality medical care, diagnostics, supportive care, and clinical trials from these regional care centers, but they are required to attend frequent in-person visits to access these services. Rural and underserved patients experience more barriers than their urban counterparts to access the same level of care.

Surgical resection is the only curative treatment. However, only a minority of patients with PC can obtain surgery. Improving the overall survival (OS) rate of patients with PC is still a major challenge. Molecular biomarkers are a significant approach for diagnostic and predictive use in PCs. Several prediction models have been developed for patients newly diagnosed with PC that is operable or patients with advanced and metastatic PC; however, these models require further validation. Therefore, precise biomarkers are urgently required to increase the efficiency of predicting a disease-free survival (DFS), OS, and sensitivity to immunotherapy in PC patients and to improve the prognosis of PC. METHODS: In the present study, we first evaluated the highly and selectively expressed targets in PC, using the GeoMxTM Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) and then, we analyzed the roles of these targets in PCs using TCGA database. RESULTS: LAMB3, FN1, KRT17, KRT19, and ANXA1 were defined as the top five upregulated targets in PC compared with paracancer. The TCGA database results confirmed the expression pattern of LAMB3, FN1, KRT17, KRT19, and ANXA1 in PCs. Significantly, LAMB3, FN1, KRT19, and ANXA1 but not KRT17 can be considered as biomarkers for survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and risk model analysis. Furthermore, in combination, LAMB3, FN1, KRT19, and ANXA1 predict the DFS and, in combination, LAMB3, KRT19, and ANXA1 predict the OS. Immunotherapy is significant for PCs that are inoperable. The immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) analysis indicated that higher expressions of FN1 or ANXA1 are correlated with lower ICB response. In contrast, there are no significant differences in the ICB response between high and low expression of LAMB3 and KRT19. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, LAMB3, FN1, KRT19, and ANXA1 are good predictors of PC prognosis. Furthermore, FN1 and ANXA1 can be predictors of immunotherapy in PCs.

We analysed codon usage and related indices using 18,000 coding sequences (CDSs) retrieved from H. manillensis RNA-Seq data. RESULTS: We identified four highly preferred codons in H. manillensis that have G/C-endings. Points generated in an effective number of codons (ENC) plot distributed below the standard curve and the slope of a neutrality plot was less than 1. Highly expressed CDSs had lower ENC content and higher GC content than weakly expressed CDSs. Principal component analysis conducted on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values divided CDSs according to GC content and divided codons according to ending bases. Moreover, by determining codon usage, we found that the majority of blood-diet related genes have undergone less adaptive evolution in H. manillensis, except for those with homologous sequences in the host species. CONCLUSIONS: Codon usage in H. manillensis had an overall preference toward C-endings and indicated that codon usage patterns are mediated by differential expression, GC content, and biological function.

Each surgeon performed two simulated surgeries of a distal tibial fracture on a Sawbone? under standardized conditions either wearing regular PPE or special COVID-19 PPE. Baseline values at rest were acquired for heart rate, blood pressure, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO(2)), respiratory rate and capillary blood gas (CBG) analysis including capillary partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) and carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), followed by four different standardized tests of attentional performance (TAP). Subsequently, the surgeon performed the first surgery according to a randomly determined order, with regular or COVID-19 PPE conditions in an operation theatre. After each surgery vital signs were acquired and CBG and TAP were performed again. RESULTS: In our simulated surgical procedure heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not show relevant differences. Percutaneously measured SpO(2) decreased with additional layers of PPE, while CBG parameters were not affected. TAP tests showed a significant impairment of attention if PPEs were compared to the baseline, but both PPEs had similar results and no meaningful differences could be measured. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, for surgical procedures additional PPE required during COVID-19 pandemic does not relevant affect the surgeons mental and physical performance. Surgeries under COVID-19 PPE conditions appear safe and do not increase patient risk.

For this purpose, a detailed study by means of a web-based survey was conducted by the Working Group Young Rheumatology (AGJR) of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) and the German Rheumatism League National Association. By means of subgroup analysis of the data regarding video consultation, the aim was now to find out which requirements and wishes patients and physicians have for video consultations. METHODS: The prospective survey was distributed via social media, QR code and email. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis related to video consultation were performed and correlations were shown. RESULTS: The data indicated positive attitudes toward video consultation on the part of both patients (n = 299) and rheumatologists (n = 129). A correlation between age and positive opinion of the video consultation was found among the patients (r = 0.161, p = 0.006), especially among female patients a positive approval of the video consultation was found with increasing age (r = 0.244, p < 0.001 to male patients: r = ?0.190, p = 0.145). Regarding the travelling time to the treating rheumatologist, male patients found the video consultation more attractive with increasing travelling time (r = 0.229, p = 0.078). With respect to the wishes of patients and physicians, video consultation should be used primarily for follow-up or emergency appointments. Video consultation for initial appointments, on the other hand, was very rarely mentioned. CONCLUSION: During the COVID 19 pandemic, video consultation was increasingly popular among rheumatology patients as well as among rheumatologists.","output":"Akzeptanz der Videosprechstunde unter Patienten/innen mit entzndlich rheumatischen Erkrankungen ist geschlechts- und ortsabh?ngig C Ergebnisse einer Online-Umfrage unter Patienten/innen und ?rzten/innen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis bacilli can enter the human body through the digestive system, the skin, and the mucous membranes, although they mainly enter through the respiratory tract.

Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. Analysis was performed for day ? 10 to + 10 relative to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally, three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups, (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for starting anakinra treatment. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics and clinical parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. As a consequence of bias by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (p = 0.0002), ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no relevant differences in kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decreases of clinical parameters, including temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0.003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group. No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were observed between groups. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.

Existing research has relied on the latent variable model in assessing COVID-19-related distress. Network theory provides an alternative framework wherein symptoms are conceptualised as causal, interconnected constituents rather than outcomes of mental disorders. AIMS: To assess networks of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms among quarantined individuals. METHOD: Consenting individuals in different quarantine centres in Qatar completed the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. We used partial correlation network methods to illustrate interactions of self-reported psychopathology. RESULTS: Participants with COVID-19 were significantly older and had a significantly higher proportion of males. The most central node was COVID-19, followed by thoughts of self-harm. COVID-19 status was strongly positively connected to thoughts of self-harm, which was positively connected to psychomotor changes, which were connected to decreased concentration. COVID-19 status was also positively connected to feeling anxious, which was strongly connected to inability to concentrate, which was connected to feeling afraid. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 was the most influential factor, with the highest number and strength of connections to psychopathology in a network of anxiety and depressive symptoms in a quarantine setting. Beyond the resolution of the infection, therapeutic interventions targeting psychomotor changes might prove beneficial in reducing suicidality among quarantined individuals with COVID-19.

We estimated indoor temperatures by using a prediction model of indoor temperature from a previous study and further calculated the cumulative degree hours at different indoor temperature ranges. Samples of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases were collected from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) from 2000 to 2014 in Taiwan. We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to analyze the data. Our data demonstrated a significant risk of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases at 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 C when cooling cumulative degree hours exceeded 62, 43, 16, 1, and 1 during the hot season (May to October), respectively, and at 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 C when heating cumulative degree hours exceeded 1, 1, 1, 11, and 33 during the cold season (November to April), respectively. Cumulative degree hours were different according to gender and age groups. Policymakers should further consider the cumulative effects to prevent hot- or cold-related cardiovascular diseases for populations.","output":"Cumulative effect of indoor temperature on cardiovascular disease-related emergency department visits among older adults in Taiwan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late February 2020, a time when severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) still felt like an abstraction in the United States, New York City's first infected patient was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital's emergency room.

This study reports the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during, respiratory complications and 30-day mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included 100 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was 14-day symptoms and/or SARS-CoV-2 test. The secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients comprising 35 females and 65 males, with a mean age of 52.4 years (range, 16-94 years) included 16 males aged greater than 70 years. The 51% of patients were tested during their admission for SARS-CoV-2; 5% were diagnosed/developed symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 during and until 14 days post-discharge; four were male and one female, mean age 41.2 years (range, 17-75 years), all had primary malignant bone or soft-tissue tumours, four of five had received immunosuppressive therapy pre-operatively. The 30-day mortality was 1% overall and 20% in those with SARS-CoV-2. The pulmonary complication rate was 3% overall.

This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential. In sum, this review hopes to provide the current understanding of what is known about long COVID.","output":"Long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome: putative pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After the detection of the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) in South Korea on January 20, 2019, it has triggered three major outbreaks. To decrease the disease burden of COVID\\\\19, social distancing and active mask wearing were encouraged, reducing the number of patients with influenza\\\\like illness and altering the detection rate of influenza and respiratory viruses in the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS). We examined the changes in respiratory viruses due to COVID\\\\19 in South Korea and virological causes of the high detection rate of human rhinovirus (hRV) in 2020. METHODS: We collected 52 684 oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with influenza\\\\like illness in cooperation with KINRESS from 2016 to 2020. Influenza virus and other respiratory viruses were confirmed using real\\\\time RT\\\\PCR. The weekly detection rate was used to compare virus detection patterns. RESULTS: Non\\\\enveloped virus (hRV, human bocavirus, and human adenovirus) detection rates during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic were maintained. The detection rate of hRV significantly increased in 2020 compared with that in 2019 and was negatively correlated with number of COVID\\\\19\\\\confirmed cases in 2020. The distribution of strains and genetic characteristics in hRV did not differ between 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic impacted the respiratory virus detection rate. The extremely low detection rate of enveloped viruses resulted from efforts to prevent the spread of COVID\\\\19 in South Korea. The high detection rate of hRV may be related to resistance against environmental conditions as a non\\\\enveloped virus and the long period of viral shedding from patients.","output":"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on respiratory surveillance and explanation of high detection rate of human rhinovirus during the pandemic in the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available","output":"Usefulness and limitations of implementing rapid tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated whether pandemic\\\\related stressors, worries, and social distancing have affected the mental health of pregnant women during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self\\\\harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID\\\\19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self\\\\harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID\\\\19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self\\\\harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self\\\\harm.

This study examined the rate of successful gallbladder specimen extraction through an overtube and hypothesized that preoperative ultrasound findings could predict successful specimen passage. METHODS Gallbladder specimens from patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were measured, and an attempt was made to pull the specimens through a commercially available overtube with an inner diameter of 16.7-mm. A radiologist blinded to the outcomes reviewed the available preoperative ultrasound measurements from these patients. Ultrasound dimensions including gallbladder length, width, and depth; wall thickness; common bile duct diameter; and size of the largest gallstone (LGS) were recorded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether ultrasound findings and patient characteristics (age, body mass index [BMI], and sex) could predict the ability of a specimen to pass through the overtube. RESULTS Of 57 patients, 44 (77%) who had preoperative ultrasounds available for electronic review were included in the final analysis. Gallstones were present in 35 (79%) of these 44 patients. Intraoperative gallbladder perforation occurred in 18 (41%) of the 44 patients, and 16 (36%) of the 44 gallbladders could be extracted through the overtube. Measurement of LGS was possible for 23 patients, and indeterminate gallstone size (IGS) was determined for 12 patients. The rate for passage of perforated versus intact gallbladders was similar (40% vs. 23%; p = 0.054). The LGS (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.33; p = 0.021) and IGS (OR, 22.97; 95% CI, 1.99-265.63; p = 0.025) predicted failed passage on multivariate logistic regression analysis. The passage rate was 80% for LGS smaller than 10 mm or no stones present, 18% for LGS 10 mm or larger, and 8% for IGS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A majority of cholecystectomy specimens cannot pass through an endoscopic overtube. Preoperative ultrasound findings can predict successful specimen extraction.

Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA).

The device is available in a range of diameters and geometries and is constructed from a single loop of NITINOL? wire. The 'Sphere' reduces aneurysm inflow by means of a high-density, patterned, elliptical surface that partially occludes the aneurysm neck. The device is secured in the healthy parent vessel by two armatures in the shape of open loops, resulting in negligible disruption of parent or daughter vessel flow. The device is virtually deployed in six anatomically accurate bifurcation aneurysms: three located at the Basilar tip and three located at the terminus bifurcation of the Internal Carotid artery (at the meeting of the middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries). Both steady state and transient flow simulations reveal that the device presents with a range of aneurysm inflow reductions, with mean flow reductions falling in the range of 30.6-71.8% across the different geometries. A significant difference is noted between steady state and transient simulations in one geometry, where a zone of flow recirculation is not captured in the steady state simulation. Across all six aneurysms, the device reduces the WSS magnitude within the aneurysm sac, resulting in a hemodynamic environment closer to that of a healthy vessel. We conclude from extensive CFD analysis that the 'Sphere' device offers very significant levels of flow reduction in a number of anatomically accurate aneurysm sizes and locations, with many advantages compared to current clinical cylindrical flow-diverter designs.

Thus, the present study sought to investigate the relationship between physical distancing and the number of future COVID-19 deaths in Brazil.Methods: The percentage of individuals who stayed within 450 meters from their residence on a given day based on mobile phone location data (Social Isolation Index) and the number of hours a day that individuals spent in their residence were both obtained from public databases provided by private companies (respectively, In Loco? and Google?). The number of COVID-19 deaths that occurred each day was obtained through official public reports from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Statistical analysis was performed to identify how levels of physical distancing related to the number of COVID-19 deaths 01 to 51 days later. A comparison was also made between the observed number of deaths and extrapolations, based on the SIR model, from before the implementation of restrictive measures to increase physical distancing.Results: The degree of physical distancing at a given date showed a strong positive Spearman correlation to the number of COVID-19 deaths 40 days later (Rho=.75, p<.01, for the Social Isolation Index, and Rho=.83, p<.01, for the added number of hours spent in ones residence). The trajectory of deaths as a function of time and physical distancing indicated that more distancing was associated to a higher peak number of deaths, a sooner arrival of that peak, and more accumulated deaths. A Social Isolation Index above 45% and/or spending more than 15% more hours at ones residence, as well as a rapid and intense elevation in either variable, were linked to 13.8% more future COVID-19 deaths.Conclusions: There is compelling evidence that government-enforced physical distancing in Brazil has increased the number of COVID-19 deaths in that country rather than reducing it.

The incidence of the disease is expected to grow worldwide due to the aging of the population and risk factors related to lifestyle behaviors. Considering the lifestyle of women with breast cancer before or after surgery, pilates exercise may be a complementary intervention additionally to standard treatment. OBJECTIVE To analyze the efficacy of pilates compared to other exercises and to no exercise for women with breast cancer diagnosis. METHOD We searched Medline via Pubmed, Embase via Ovid, Amed via EBSCO, Biosis via Ovid, Lilacs and the Cochrane Library for relevant publications until March 2017. The keywords used were pilates and \\"breast cancer,\\" and only randomized controlled trials were included. Critical appraisal was done using Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE score for assessing the quality of evidence. RESULTS A total of five studies were included in our review. Our results demonstrate that pilates or home-based exercises are better than no exercise in each individual study. We observed significant improvements in the pilates groups compared to home-based exercises. Additionally, in the individual studies, we observed improvements in range of motion, pain and fatigue.

Although mHealth apps have many benefits, their acceptance is still low in certain areas and groups. Most mHealth acceptance studies are based on technology acceptance models. In particular, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model was developed to predict technology acceptance in a consumer context. However, to date, only a few studies have used the UTAUT2 model to predict mHealth acceptance and confirm its suitability for the health sector. Thus, it is unclear whether the UTAUT2 model is suitable for predicting mHealth acceptance and whether essential variables for a health-related context are missing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the suitability of UTAUT2 for predicting mHealth acceptance. METHODS: In this study, diabetes was used as an example as mHealth apps are a significant element of diabetes self-management. In addition, diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting young and older people worldwide. An explorative literature review and guided interviews with 11 mHealth or technology acceptance experts and 8 mHealth users in Austria and Germany were triangulated to identify all relevant constructs for predicting mHealth acceptance. The interview participants were recruited by purposive sampling until theoretical saturation was reached. Data were analyzed using structured content analysis based on inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: This study was able to confirm the relevance of all exogenous UTAUT2 constructs. However, it revealed two additional constructs that may also need to be considered to better predict mHealth acceptance: trust and perceived disease threat. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the UTAUT2 model is suitable for predicting mHealth acceptance. However, the model should be extended to include 2 additional constructs for use in the mHealth context.","output":"Suitability of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 Model for Predicting mHealth Acceptance Using Diabetes as an Example: Qualitative Methods Triangulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently the world is facing an extremely tough time due to the prevalence of the Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV or COVID-19, which has been declared a pandemic by WHO. The virus usually transmits via droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Since there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, social distancing and proper quarantine of infected persons are needed. To include and quantify the spatial effect of the pandemic regarding the geotemporal development of 2019-nCoV, a mathematical model of partial differential equations is essential. In this chapter a diffusion model has been developed by dividing the total population of constant size into four classes: susceptible population, infected population, quarantined population and recovered population. Here the disease transmission factor for both infected and quarantined population into the susceptible population are in more general form. Looking for a travelling wave solution this model can give the wave speed at which the disease 2019-nCoV spread. Additionally it can be predicted whether the total population in forward time will become susceptible or not in the absence of vaccine. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Geographic Spread and Control of 2019-nCoV in the Absence of Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single port access (SPA) surgery is a new procedure for minimal invasive surgery using one multichannel port.

OBJECTIVES: To explore current data and hypothesis on the possible sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male reproduction system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the current literature to describe: a) the evidences on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (AC2E) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in the testes, accessory glands (including prostate) and the urinary tract; b) other coronaviruses' (SARS and MERS) ability to infect these sites. RESULTS: The co-expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was reported in spermatogonial stem cells, elongated spermatids, in at least a small percentage of prostate hillock cells and in renal tubular cells. Testicular damage was described in autopsies of SARS patients, without evidence of the virus in the specimens. Prostate is a known infection site for MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urines. DISCUSSION: There are still al lot of open questions on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male reproductive tract. The presence of receptors is not a proof that the testis provides a site for viral infection and it is still unknown if SARS-CoV-2 is capable to pass the blood-testis barrier. The possibility of a prostate involvement has not been investigated yet: we have no data, but theoretically it cannot be excluded.

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Cohort of adults (18-64) with T2DM, an annual household income <$30,000, and who were continuously enrolled in an employer-sponsored UnitedHealthcare plan for at least two years between 2009-2014. STUDY DESIGN: We employed a linear regression Difference-In-Differences (DID) approach with a matched comparison group. To assess for differential DHP effects across adherent vs. non-adherent patients, we ran a Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences (nalysis by including an interaction term that included indicators for DHP exposure status, time and low vs. high baseline medication adherence. DATA COLLECTION: The analytic data set is limited to employer groups that purchased the DHP and standard benefit plans from UnitedHealthcare, had internal pharmacy contracts, complete pharmacy claims data and sufficient medical claims and lab data to identify employees and their dependents with T2DM. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our DID analysis did not show improved medication adherence associated with employer DHP adoption. However, the  mo suggested a difference between DHP-exposed and comparison beneficiaries when comparing the relative effect on individuals who were adherent vs. non-adherent at baseline, as suggested by the significant three-way interaction term (10.2, p=0.028). This effect was driven by the 8.2 percentage point increase in medication adherence for the DHP subsample that was non-adherent at baseline.

A standard comparison across different nucleic acid tests and their optimal experimental setups is not present. We assessed the performance of three common nucleic acid tests, namely digital PCR (dPCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we compared sensitivity and specificity of qPCR, dPCR, and LAMP and their performances when different experimental setups (namely specimen type used, use of RNA extraction, primerCprobe sets, and RNA extraction methods) are applied. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, SciFinder, and ScienceDirect for studies and preprints published between Feb 29 and Dec 15, 2020. Included dPCR, qPCR, and LAMP studies using any type of human specimens should report the number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative cases with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved PCR assays as the comparator. Studies with a sample size of less than ten, descriptive studies, case studies, reviews, and duplicated studies were excluded. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were computed from the true and false positive and negative cases using Reitsma's bivariate random-effects and bivariate latent class models. Test performance reported in area under the curve (AUC) of the three nucleic acid tests was further compared by pooling studies with similar experimental setups (eg, tests that used RNA extracted pharyngeal swabs but with either the open reading frame 1ab or the N primer). Heterogeneity was assessed and reported in I(2) and (2). FINDINGS: Our search identified 1277 studies of which we included 66 studies (11 dPCR, 32 qPCR, and 23 LAMP) with 15 017 clinical samples in total in our systematic review and 52 studies in our meta-analysis. dPCR had the highest pooled diagnostic sensitivity (941%, 95% CI 889C966, by Reitsma's model and 958%, 549C1000, by latent class model), followed by qPCR (927%, 883C956, and 934%, 609C999) and LAMP (833%, 769C882, and 862%, 207C999), using EUA-approved PCR kits as the reference standard. LAMP was the most specific with a pooled estimate of 963% (938C978) by Reitsma's model and 943% (491C1000) by latent class model, followed by qPCR (929%, 872C962, and 931%, 471C1000) and dPCR (785%, 574C908, and 738%, 09C1000). The overall heterogeneity was I(2) 05% ((2) 279) for dPCR studies, 0% (460) for qPCR studies, and 0% (396) for LAMP studies. AUCs of the three nucleic acid tests were the highest and differed the least between tests (ie, AUC>098 for all tests) when performed with RNA extracted pharyngeal swabs using SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab primer. INTERPRETATION: All three nucleic acid tests consistently perform better with pharyngeal swabs using SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab primer with RNA extraction. dPCR was shown to be the most sensitive, followed by qPCR and LAMP. However, their accuracy does not differ significantly. Instead, accuracy depends on specific experimental conditions, implying that more efforts should be directed to optimising the experimental setups for the nucleic acid tests.

Due to the caregiving demands, informal caregivers are known to experience negative mental health symptoms, such as stress or anxiety. Interventions based on Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) principles have been previously found to be effective for different populations and could also be considered as a plausible support option for informal caregivers. However, findings regarding effectiveness alone might not be sufficient for informing about the overall feasibility of the intervention. Objective: The aim of this process evaluation study was to evaluate the feasibility of a previously developed ICBT intervention for informal caregivers in Lithuania. More specifically, we evaluated the suitability of the intervention in relation to its content and delivery mode. Methods: Two studies were conducted. Study 1 consisted of participant evaluations of an 8-week, 8-module long therapist supported ICBT intervention. Evaluations for the Study 1 were retrieved from previously unused data, obtained from pilot testing of the intervention in which 63 informal caregivers took part. The evaluations contained of qualitative data (participant comments), as well as quantitative data (evaluations of each of the sessions). The Study 2 was an online stakeholder focus-group discussion conducted via Zoom. Eight stakeholders took part in the discussion, among whom there were social workers, medical professionals as well as individuals with caregiving experience themselves. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, thematic analysis, and data coding. Results: Results of the Study 1 showed that most of the pilot randomized controlled trial participants evaluated content and format of the intervention positively. These results were complemented by the findings in the Study 2, in which stakeholders evaluated the intervention as suitable and promising. In addition, stakeholders made certain suggestions for improving the intervention's usability for the informal caregivers. This included improving the instructions, providing with more guidance, and considering personalization options.

METHODS Pooling data from the Colorado Young Women Breast Cancer cohort and the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study (N = 2519 cases), we examined the association of parity, age, and clinical factors with overall survival (OS) of breast cancer over 15 years of follow-up. RESULTS Women with PPBC diagnosed at <45y had the lowest OS (p < 0.0001), while OS of nulliparous cases diagnosed at <45y did not differ from OS of cases diagnosed at 45-65y regardless of parity status. After adjustment for study site, race/ethnicity, clinical stage, year of diagnosis and stratification for oestrogen receptor status, PPBC remained an independent factor associated with poor OS. Among cases diagnosed at <45y, nulliparous cases had 1.6 times better OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95%CI 0.42-0.87) compared to those with PPBC, with a more pronounced survival difference among stage I breast cancers (HR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.11-0.79). Among very young women diagnosed at age 35y, nulliparous cases had 2.3 times better OS (HR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.23-0.84) compared to PPBC. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that postpartum status is the main driver of poor prognosis in young women with breast cancer, with the strongest association in patients diagnosed at age 35y and in those with stage I disease.","output":"Overall survival is the lowest among young women with postpartum breast cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in Turkish among a diverse group with a focus on the prevalence of coronavirus related fear across gender, age intervals, SES, chronic illness situation, and educational level.

MT-3 is expressed by epithelial cells of the human kidney, including the cells of the proximal tubule. Our laboratory has previously shown that mortal cultures of human proximal tubular (HPT) cells express MT-3 and form domes in the cell monolayer, a morphological feature indicative of vectorial active transport, an essential function of the proximal tubule. However, an immortalized proximal tubular cell line HK-2 lacks the expression of MT-3 and fails to form domes in the monolayer. Transfection of HK-2 cells with the MT-3 gene restores dome formation in these cells suggesting that MT-3 is required for vectorial active transport. In order to determine how MT-3 imparts this essential feature to the proximal tubule, we sought to identify proteins that interact either directly or indirectly with MT-3. Using a combination of pulldowns, co-immunoprecipitations, and mass spectrometry analysis, putative protein interactants were identified and subsequently confirmed by Western analysis and confocal microscopy, following which proteins with direct physical interactions were investigated through molecular docking. Our data shows that MT-3 interacts with myosin-9, aldolase A, enolase 1, -actin, and tropomyosin 3 and that these interactions are maximized at the periphery of the apical membrane of doming proximal tubule cells. Together these observations reveal that MT-3 interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and energy metabolism, and these interactions at the apical membrane support vectorial active transport and cell differentiation in proximal tubule cultures.","output":"Protein interactions with metallothionein-3 promote vectorial active transport in human proximal tubular cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has spread widely on a large scale in the whole world at present, seriously endangering human health.

We evaluated the extent of environmental contamination in the ICU and correlated this with patient and disease factors, including the impact of different ventilatory modalities. METHODS: In this observational study, surface environmental samples collected from ICU patient rooms and common areas were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Select samples from the common area were tested by cell culture. Clinical data were collected and correlated to the presence of environmental contamination. Results were compared to historical data from a previous study in general wards. RESULTS: In total, 200 samples from 20 patient rooms and 75 samples from common areas and the staff pantry were tested. The results showed that 14 rooms had at least 1 site contaminated, with an overall contamination rate of 14% (28 of 200 samples). Environmental contamination was not associated with day of illness, ventilatory mode, aerosol-generating procedures, or viral load. The frequency of environmental contamination was lower in the ICU than in general ward rooms. Eight samples from the common area were positive, though all were negative on cell culture. CONCLUSION: Environmental contamination in the ICU was lower than in the general wards. The use of mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen was not associated with greater surface contamination, supporting their use and safety from an infection control perspective. Transmission risk via environmental surfaces in the ICUs is likely to be low. Nonetheless, infection control practices should be strictly reinforced, and transmission risk via droplet or airborne spread remains.","output":"Environmental contamination in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) intensive care unit-What is the risk?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, coupled with slow and inequitable vaccine roll-out, there is an urgent need for evidence to underpin optimum vaccine deployment, aiming to maximise global population immunity at speed.

We compared anti-spike IgG antibody responses after a single dose of ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the COVID-19 Infection Survey in the UK general population. In 100,849 adults who received at least one vaccination, 13,404 (13.3%) had serological and/or PCR evidence of prior infection. Prior infection significantly boosted antibody responses for all three vaccines, producing a higher peak level and longer half-life, and a response comparable to those without prior infection receiving two vaccinations. In those with prior infection, median time above the positivity threshold was estimated to last for >1 year after the first dose. Single-dose vaccination targeted to those previously infected may provide protection in populations with high rates of previous infection faced with limited vaccine supply, as an interim measure while vaccine campaigns are scaled up.","output":"The challenge of limited vaccine supplies: impact of prior infection on anti-spike IgG antibody trajectories after a single COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although the side effects of cancer chemotherapy impair a patient's quality of life, family members' awareness of side effects may relieve patient anxiety and distress. AIM We investigated whether patients and their families were consistent in recognizing the occurrence and severity of symptomatic side effects of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospective observational study. We administered a questionnaire survey to patients and family members to assess the frequency of occurrence (1: never, 2: almost never, 3: sometimes, 4: frequently, 5: almost always, 6: unknown) and the degree of severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: extremely severe, 5: unknown) of physical and psychological symptoms associated with cancer chemotherapy. Weighted Kappa and Cramer coefficients were used to assess consistency between the two groups. We surveyed 20 pairs of patients (5 men, 15 women) and their families (10 men, 10 women); 17 pairs lived together. The median age was 65.5 years (interquartile [IQR], 58.75, 69.25) for patients and 61.00 years (IQR, 47.25, 71.25) for family members. Of patients, 17 had solid cancer, and three had leukemia. Family members mostly recognized objectively visible symptoms such as hair loss and development of spots and keratinization. However, it was difficult for families to detect invisible subjective symptoms such as weakness, dysesthesia, depressed mood, and unarticulated anxiety. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that recognition of invisible subjective symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy was difficult even for family members. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in which various medical professionals actively communicate with both patients and families is important. Information sharing in collaboration with patients and families could increase understanding of the patient's condition and optimize patient care.","output":"Consistency between patients and families in recognizing cancer chemotherapy side effects: A questionnaire survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 prompted stringent mitigation measures to \\"flatten the curve\\" quickly leading to an asphyxiated US economy as a national side effect. There are severe drawbacks to this strategy. The resulting flattened curve remains exponential and always under utilizes available healthcare capacity with a chance of still overburdening it. Moreover, while a mitigation strategy involving isolation and containment can scale down infections, it not only prolongs the outbreak significantly, but also leaves a susceptible population in its wake that's ripe for a secondary outbreak. Since economic activity is inversely proportional to mitigation, curtailing the outbreak with sustained mitigation can stifle the economy severely with disastrous repercussions. Full mitigation for the duration of an outbreak is therefore unsustainable and, overall, a poor solution with potentially catastrophic consequences that could've been avoided. A new strategy, coined a \\"Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management\\", abbreviated MAPCM, presented herein can shape the outbreak curve in a controlled manner for optimal utilization of healthcare resources during the pandemic, while drastically shortening the outbreak duration compared to mitigation by itself without trading off lives. This method allows mitigation measures to be relaxed gradually from day one, which enables economic activity to resume gradually from the onset of a pandemic. Since outbreak curves (such as hospitalizations) can be programmed using this method, they can also be shaped to accommodate changing needs during the outbreak; and to build herd immunity without the damaging side effects. The method can also be used to ease out of containment. MAPCM is a method and not a model. It is compatible with any appropriate outbreak model; and herein it is illustrated in examples using a hybrid logistic model.","output":"Method for Active Pandemic Curve Management (MAPCM)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah (1) mengembangkan bahan ajar matematika berbasis daring untuk meningkatkan kemampuan pemecahan masalah dalam pembelajaran jarak jauh di era pandemi dan (2) mengetahui tingkat validasi pengembangan bahan ajar matematika berbasis daring untuk meningkatkan kemampuan pemecahan masalah berdasarkan uji validasi pakar.

Yet, while significant progress has been achieved across the technics required to reconstruct and in vitro culture nuclear transfer embryos, SCNT outcomes in terms of offspring production rates are still limited. Here we provide a snapshot of the practical application of SCNT in farm animals and pets. Moreover, we suggest a path to improve SCNT through alternative strategies inspired by the physiological reprogramming in male and female gametes in preparation for the totipotency required after fertilization. Almost all papers on SCNT focused on nuclear reprogramming in the somatic cells after nuclear transfer. We believe that this is misleading, and even if it works sometimes, it does so in an uncontrolled way. Physiologically, the oocyte cytoplasm deploys nuclear reprogramming machinery specifically designed to address the male chromosome, the maternal alleles are prepared for totipotency earlier, during oocyte nuclear maturation. Significant advances have been made in remodeling somatic nuclei in vitro through the expression of protamines, thanks to a plethora of data available on spermatozoa epigenetic modifications. Missing are the data on large-scale nuclear reprogramming of the oocyte chromosomes.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between patients undergoing a Lichtenstein's hernioplasty with a porcine mesh versus a standard synthetic. METHODS A prospective, randomized, double-blinded multicenter, evaluation of inguinal hernia repair was conducted between 2008 and 2010. Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed using Strattice? or lightweight polypropylene (Ultrapro) mesh. Quality of life, pain, overall complication rate, and recurrence were measured. RESULTS One hundred and seventy-two patients were randomized to Strattice? (n = 84) or Ultrapro (n = 88). At 3 months postoperatively, there were no differences on the occurrence or type of wound events [RR: 0.98 (95% CI 0.52-1.86, p = 0.69), Strattice? (15 events) vs. Ultrapro (16 events)]. The mean level of impairment caused by the hernia, assessed by Activities Assessment Scale (AAS), significantly decreased postoperatively in both groups at 3 months (31% Strattice? and 37% Ultrapro). Patients in the Strattice group reported significantly less postoperative pain during postoperative days 1 through 3 compared to Ultrapro patients. However, the amount of postoperative pain at 3 months, as assessed by the mean worst pain score on a visual analog scale and the Brief Pain Index, was similar between groups (95% CI 1.0-29.3). No hernia recurrences were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS Strattice? is safe and effective in repairing inguinal hernia, with comparable intra-operative and early postoperative morbidity to synthetic mesh. Long-term follow-up is necessary in order to know whether the clinical outcomes of Strattice are equivalent to standard synthetic mesh in patients undergoing Lichtenstein's hernioplasty.","output":"Early report of a randomized comparative clinical trial of Strattice? reconstructive tissue matrix to lightweight synthetic mesh in the repair of inguinal hernias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The WHO and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to compare the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the UK. We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the WHO algorithm, National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), CURB-65, CRB-65, Pandemic Modified Early Warning Score (PMEWS) and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. RESULTS: We analysed data from 20 891 adults, of whom 4611 (22.1%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2553 (12.2%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point rule) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point rule) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.97 and 0.95, respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.30 and 0.27, respectively). The NEWS2 score showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. CONCLUSION: CURB-65, PMEWS and the NEWS2 score provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support.

In fact, most countries have launched green recovery plans after 2020. Green technology innovation has attracted much attention, and many countries have introduced a series of subsidy policies to support green technology innovation transformation (GTIT). This study first discusses the influence of government subsidies on the GTIT of Chinese enterprises by using the manual collection and sorting of data concerning environmental protection subsidies, R&D subsidies, and talent subsidies, and the effects of these subsidies on different enterprises are analyzed. Empirical results show that environmental protection subsidies, R&D subsidies, and talent subsidies can significantly promote GTIT, and the effects of these subsidies on the GTIT of different enterprise are heterogeneous. The environmental protection subsidies, R&D subsidies, and talent subsidies have significant positive impacts on the GTIT of non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and high assetCliability-ratio enterprises. In contrast, only environmental protection and talent subsidies have significant positive effects on the GTIT of enterprises with low assetCliability-ratio. Environmental protection subsidies, R&D subsidies, and talent subsidies will promote the enterprises to increase their R&D investment, therefore enhancing their GTIT.

Here, we evaluated the in vitro activities of artesunate (AS) and two ozonides (OZ418 and OZ277) against human &#945;-coronavirus NL63 and ?-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in several cell lines. OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, &#8805;17 M, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was &#8805;12 M and &#8805;7 M, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC50 (5.3 M and 11.6 M, respectively), higher than the EC50 of remdesivir (1.0  0.1 M), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC50 of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination.

METHODS: Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 to April 9, 2020, were collected using \\"wuhan,\\" \\"corona,\\" \\"nCov,\\" and \\"covid\\" as search keywords. RESULTS: Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members, while topics related to joy included words of gratitude and good health.

We focus onCOVID-19and its information during the period when the disease was widely spread in China, i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the province level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to information. We find a high correlation between the disease and information data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive messages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative and neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms, i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of infected using different disease spatial related and information-related characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of nearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy.

In this report we present results of comparative sequence analysis of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) structural proteins, and the two most conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (HEL), aimed at a revision of the Coronaviridae taxonomy. The results of pairwise comparisons involving structural and replicase proteins of the Coronavirus genus were consistent and produced percentages of sequence identities that were distributed in discontinuous clusters. Inter-group pairwise scores formed a single cluster in the lowest percentile. No homologs of the N and E proteins have been found outside coronaviruses, and the only (very) distant homologs of S and M proteins were identified in toroviruses. Intragroup sequence conservation was higher, although for some pairs, especially those from the most diverse group 1, scores were close or even overlapped with those from the intergroup comparisons. Phylogenetic analysis of six proteins using a neighbor-joining algorithm confirmed three coronavirus groups. Comparative sequence analysis of RdRp and HEL domains were extended to include arterivirus and ronivirus homologs.

This unplanned redeployment raised concerns among various health care workers. The objective of the current study is to explore working dynamics and experience of junior and middle grade doctors during current pandemic. METHODS: We organised a nationwide cross-sectional survey of junior and middle grade doctors working in the United Kingdom. The survey was aimed to study their level of participation during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its impact on their clinical practices and well-being. RESULTS: In total, 1564 completed questionnaires with representations from all regions of the United Kingdom were included. The mean age of respondents was 30.64 years (95% confidence interval +1.025; standard deviation = 9.9057). There were 51.5% females with significantly more participants from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic group (n = 835, p = 0.0073); 963 (61.6%, p ? 0.0001) doctors were redeployed outside their primary speciality. The major redeployments were from other specialities to Intensive Therapy Units (41.8%, p ? 0.001); 63.3% of respondents spend more than 8 weeks in redeployed speciality (p ? 0.0001). There was a significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on personal, mental, and physical well-being of doctors. The major areas requiring immediate attention include proper leadership and clinical support (64.1%), pre-redeployment planning and induction (48.5%), redeployment according to the skills and/or in familiar specialities (44.6%), and regular mental and physical well-being checks (37%). CONCLUSION: The outcome of the survey concluded with four major recommendations, including the need to have a named supervisor for these doctors, structured induction program, regular well-being checks, and involving them in crisis planning. These recommendations will help to shape future health care policies and management particularly when it is related to redeployment of doctors during any crisis or pandemic.","output":"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on working dynamics of junior and middle grade doctors in the United Kingdom: Learning from their experience requires immediate improvement in health care planning and managementAn outcome analysis of a nationwide survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the unprecedented demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of specimen pooling have recently been explored. As previous studies were limited to mathematical modeling or testing on low throughput PCR instruments, this study aimed to assess pooling on high throughput analyzers. To assess the impact of pooling, SARS-CoV-2 dilutions were performed at varying pool depths (i.e. 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) into test-negative nasopharyngeal or oropharynx/anterior nares swabs matrix. Testing was evaluated on the automated Roche Cobas 6800 system, or the Roche MagNApure LC 2.0 or MagNAPure 96 instruments paired with a laboratory-developed test using a 96-well PCR format. The frequency of detection in specimens with low viral loads was evaluated using archived specimens collected throughout the first pandemic wave. The proportion of detectable results per pool depths was used to estimate the potential impact. In addition, workflow at the analytical stage, and pre-and post-stages of testing were also considered. The current study estimated that pool depths of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 would have allowed the detection of 98.3%, 96.0%, and 92.6% of positive SARS-CoV-2 results identified in the first wave of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. Overall, this study demonstrated that pooling on high throughput instrumentation can dramatically increase the overall testing capacity to meet increased demands, with little compromising to sensitivity at low pool depths. However, the human resources required at the pre-analytical stage of testing is a particular challenging to achieve.","output":"Look before diving into pooling of SARS-CoV-2 samples on high throughput analyzers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has required thousands of public schools to quickly adapt to hybrid or fully remote models.

Dissemination strategies (n = 42) were more frequently reported than implementation strategies (n = 24). Implementation strategies were more frequently evaluated (n = 13 vs. 7 dissemination strategies) and associated with positive outcomes. The 13 studies that evaluated strategies were at high or serious risk of bias.

We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary and booster vaccinations. MethodsWe undertook a prospective population-based study in UK adults ([]16 years) vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, including data from Jan 12, 2021, to Feb 21, 2022. We modelled risk of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection separately for participants who had completed a primary course of vaccination (two-dose or, in the immunosuppressed, three-dose course of either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAdOx1] or BNT1262b2) and for those who had additionally received a booster dose (BNT1262b2 or mRNA-1273). Cox regression models were used to explore associations between sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, pharmacological, and nutritional factors and breakthrough infection, defined as a self-reported positive result on a lateral flow or reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Models were further adjusted for weekly SARS-CoV-2 incidence at the local (lower tier local authority) level. Findings14,713 participants were included in the post-primary analysis and 10,665 in the post-booster analysis, with a median follow-up of 203 days (IQR 195-216) in the post-primary cohort and 85 days (66-103) in the post-booster cohort. 1051 (7.1%) participants in the post-primary cohort and 1009 (9.4%) participants in the post-booster cohort reported a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. A primary course of ChAdOx1 (vs BNT182b2) was associated with higher risk of infection, both in the post-primary cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.41-1.88) and in the post-booster cohort after boosting with mRNA-1273 (1.29 [1.03-1.61] vs BNT162b2 primary plus BNT162b2 booster). A lower risk of breakthrough infection was associated with older age (post-primary: 0.96 [0.96-0.97] per year; post-booster: 0.97 [0.96-0.98]), whereas a higher risk of breakthrough infection was associated with lower levels of education (post-primary: 1.66 [1.35-2.06] for primary or secondary vs postgraduate; post-booster: 1.36 [1.08-1.71]) and at least three weekly visits to indoor public places (post-primary: 1.38 [1.15-1.66] vs none; post-booster: 1.33 [1.10-1.60]). ConclusionsVaccine type, socioeconomic status, age, and behaviours affect risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection following a primary schedule and a booster dose. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for papers published up to Feb 18, 2022, using the search terms (breakthrough OR post-vaccin*) AND (SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID) AND (disease OR infection) AND (determinant OR \\"risk factor\\" OR associat*), with no language restrictions. Existing studies on risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated individuals have found associations with age, comorbidities, vaccine type, and previous infection; however, findings have been inconsistent across studies. Most studies have been limited to specific subgroups or have focused on severe outcomes, and very few have considered breakthrough infections after a booster dose or have adjusted for behaviours affecting exposure to other people. Added value of this studyThis study is among the first to provide a detailed analysis of a wide range of risk factors for breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, both after the primary course of vaccination and after a booster dose. Our large study size and detailed data have allowed us to investigate associations with various sociodemographic, clinical, pharmacological, and nutritional factors. Monthly follow-up data have additionally given us the opportunity to consider the effects of behaviours that may have changed across the pandemic, while adjusting for local SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings add to growing evidence that risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary or booster vaccinations can differ to those in unvaccinated populations, with effects attenuated for previously observed risk factors such as body-mass index and Asian ethnicity. The clear difference we observed between the efficacies of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 as the primary course of vaccination appears to have been reduced by the use of BNT162b2 boosters, but not by mNRA-1273 boosters. As more countries introduce booster vaccinations, future population-based studies with longer follow-up will be needed to investigate our findings further.","output":"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection after primary vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT1262b2 and after booster vaccination with BNT1262b2 or mRNA-1273: a population-based cohort study (COVIDENCE UK)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Objetivo Analizar la efectividad de una intervencin mediante acupuntura y auriculoterapia para la reduccin clnica de sntomas de estrs y ansiedad en personal sanitario durante la pandemia de COVID-19 Dise?o Estudio prospectivo de comparacin de 2 cohortes Emplazamiento Urgencias del Hospital de Palams, Girona Participantes Sanitarios del servicio de urgencias Participaron 22 profesionales, 11 en cada grupo Intervenciones Se aplic la versin abreviada de las Escalas de Depresin, Ansiedad y Estrs (DASS-21) a todos los participantes, los del grupo de intervencin (GI) recibieron adems 6 sesiones de acupuntura y auriculoterapia Posteriormente se repiti la escala DASS-21 Mediciones Las variables fueron grupo, sexo, edad, categora profesional, a?os de experiencia en urgencias, escala DASS-21 con sus subescalas para estrs, ansiedad y depresin Resultados El 45,4% de los profesionales sufran estrs, el 40,9% ansiedad y el 27,2% depresin Hay una reduccin del estrs en un 90,9% del GI frente al 18,2% del grupo control (GC) y esta es estadsticamente significativa Hay una reduccin de la ansiedad en un 81,8% del GI frente al 63,6% del GC: p = 0,065;odds ratio: 2,57 (intervalo de confianza del 95%, 0,36-18,33) La media de la ansiedad del GI es estadsticamente inferior en el valor postintervencin que en el valor preintervencin (1,36 frente a 3,90;p = 0,003), mientras que en el GC (3,09 frente a 2,45;p = 0,208) Hay una reduccin del nivel de depresin en un 81,8% del GI frente al 45,5% del GC (p = 0,183) Conclusiones La acupuntura es un tratamiento que mejora los niveles de estrs y ansiedad de los profesionales sanitarios frente a la COVID-19 Objective To analyze the effectiveness of an intervention using acupuncture and auriculotherapy for the clinical reduction of symptoms of stress and anxiety in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic Design Prospective study comparing 2 cohorts Setting Emergency Room of the Hospital de Palams, Girona Participants Health workers from the emergency service A total of 22 professionals participated, 11 in each group Interventions The short version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) was performed on all participants, the intervention group (IG) also received 6 sessions of acupuncture and auriculotherapy Subsequently, the DASS-21 scale was repeated Measurements The variables were group, sex, age, professional category, years of experience in the emergency room, DASS-21 scale with its subscales for stress, anxiety and depression Results A 45 4% of the professionals suffered stress, 40 9% anxiety and 27 2% depression There is a reduction of stress by 90,9% in the IG vs 18 2% in the control group (CG), this being statistically significant There is an anxiety reduction in 81 8% of the IG vs 63 6% of the CG: p = 0 065;odds ratio: 2 57 (95% confidence interval, 0 36C18 33) The mean anxiety of the IG is statistically lower in the post-intervention value than in the pre-intervention value (1 36 vs 3 90;p = 0 003), while in the CG (3 09 vs 2 45;p = 0 208) There is a reduction in the level of depression in 81 8% of the IG vs 45 5% of the CG (p = 0 183) Conclusions Acupuncture is a treatment that improves stress and anxiety levels in healthcare professionals against COVID-19","output":"Efectividad de la acupuntura y la auriculoterapia para reducir el nivel de depresin, ansiedad y estrs en personal sanitario de urgencias durante la pandemia de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Pandemic has left a devastating trail all over the world, in terms of loss of lives, economic decline, travel restrictions, trade deficit, and collapsing economy including real-estate, job loss, loss of health benefits, the decline in quality of access to care and services and overall quality of life.

METHODS: In an ongoing study of people with BD who used an online mood monitoring tool, True Colours, 356 participants provided weekly data on their mental health. Symptoms of depression, mania, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts were compared in 2019 and 2020. From May 2020, participants also provided weekly data on the effect of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on anxiety, coping strategies, access to care, and medications. RESULTS: On average, symptoms of depression, mania, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts did not significantly differ in 2020 compared to 2019, but there was evidence of heterogeneity. There were high rates of anxiety about the pandemic and its impact on coping strategies, which increased to over 70% of responders in January 2021. A significant proportion of participants reported difficulty accessing routine care (27%) and medications (21%).

Diagnosis delay was defined as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the date of diagnosis. Treatment delay was defined as the time interval between diagnosis and treatment commencement. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with TB diagnosis and treatment delay, including ethnic minority status. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the strength of association between the dependant and independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 318,792 TB patients were included in the study with a mean age of 51.7 years (SD 17.7). The majority of patients were male (72.6%) and Han ethnicity (90.6%).

The median [IQR] of the sperm parameters before and after the vaccination were: sperm volume before 3.0 [2.0-4.0] and after 3.0 [1.6-3.9] ml, p=0.02; sperm concentration: before 26.5 [14.0-64.7] and after 31.0 [14.2-80.0] 106/ml, p=0.35; and total motile count: before 33.7 [9.0-66.0] and after 29 [6.0-97.5] 106, p=0.96. Sub-group analyses were performed for patients with male infertility and patients with a normal semen analysis. Neither of the sub-groups showed significant changes post-vaccination. Conclusion Sperm parameters showed no significant changes following vaccination among men with a normal and abnormal semen analysis. Therefore, the BNT162b2 vaccine appears not to affect sperm parameters. The preliminary results are reassuring for the entire global population, currently undergoing intense vaccination campaigns against COVID-19.","output":"The BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine does not impair sperm parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Public health measures during COVID-19 have led to an unprecedented change in social lifestyle which might have an impact on the allergen sensitization in population. We sought to explore the prevalence patterns of serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) sensitization and serum total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) level among patients with clinical symptoms of suspected allergic diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in south China. Methods: We assessed cross-sectional datasets from the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangzhou Medical University from 2017 to 2020. Data on clinical symptoms of the patients with suspected allergic diseases in the hospital were collected and data from February to June in each year were extracted. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to test statistical significance among years. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the magnitudes of the differences among years. Findings: The number of hospital visits for patients with suspected allergy symptoms decreased compared with previous years during COVID-19. For inhalant allergens, there was a statistically significant difference (P<005) in the positive rate in 2020 compared with 2017, while no significant differences were found when comparing 2018 and 2019 with 2017, respectively. The odds of sIgE positives in inhalant allergens for 2017 and 2020 were all larger than 100, with 157 (P<0001) for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 143 (P=0024) for Dermatophagoides farina, 150 (P<0001) for German cockroach and 200 (P=0004) for dog dander, respectively. No significant difference was found in the prevalence change of food allergens in four years. For the positive rate of tIgE, a significant difference was found for the year 2017 and 2020 with the odds of 127 (P<0001). When comparing 2020 with 2017, there was a statistically significant difference (P<0001) in the positive rate of inhalant allergens and tIgE in male population and female population. The positive rate of serum sIgE of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and tIgE were statistically different (P<0001) in each age group. The positive rate of serum sIgE of German cockroach allergen was statistically different (P<0001) in the adult group, and the positive rate of serum sIgE of dog dander allergen was statistically different (P<0001) between the school-age children group and the adult group. Interpretation: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rate of inhalant allergens and tIgE level increased while the positive rate of food allergens remained stable. Staying at home for a long time without frequent ventilation, insufficient sunshine or storing food at home might contribute to the result.

Many infected people went undetected because their symptoms were mild or asymptomatic, but the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic infections remained unknown. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic cases, as we as the prevalence of COVID-19 in Henan province. Methods We constructed SEAIUHR model based on COVID-19 cases reported from 21 January to 26 February 2020 in Henan province to estimate the proportion and infectivity of asymptomatic cases, as we as the change of effective reproductive number, \\\\({R}_{t}\\\\). At the same time, we simulated the changes of cases in different scenarios by changing the time and intensity of the implementation of prevention and control measures. Results The proportion of asymptomatic cases among COVID-19 infected individuals was 42% and infectivity of asymptomatic cases was 10% of that symptomatic ones. The basic reproductive number\\\\({R}_{0}\\\\)=2.73, and \\\\({R}_{t}\\\\) dropped below 1 on 1 February under a series of measures. If measures were taken five days earlier, the number of cases would be reduced by 2/3, and after 5 days the number would more than triple.

Depending on the level of risk for exposure to the virus, the facemasks that are used can vary. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different types of facemasks, typically used by healthcare professionals and the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, on measures of voice. METHODS: Nineteen adults (ten females, nine males) with a normal voice quality completed sustained vowel tasks. All tasks were performed for each of the six mask conditions: no mask, cloth mask, surgical mask, KN95 mask and, surgical mask over a KN95 mask with and without a face shield. Intensity measurements were obtained at a 1ft and 6ft distance from the speaker with sound level meters. Tasks were recorded with a 1ft mouth-to-microphone distance. Acoustic variables of interest were fundamental frequency (F0), and formant frequencies (F1, F2) for /a/ and /i/ and smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPs) for /a/. RESULTS: Data were analyzed to compare differences between sex and mask types. There was statistical significance between males and females for intensity measures and all acoustic variables except F2 for /a/ and F1 for /i/. Few pairwise comparisons between masks reached significance even though main effects for mask type were observed. These are further discussed in the article. CONCLUSION: The masks tested in this study did not have a significant impact on intensity, fundamental frequency, CPPs, first or second formant frequency compared to voice output without a mask. Use of a face shield seemed to affect intensity and CPPs to some extent.

This survey provides an overview of Italian oncologists facing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The lesson learned during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a better organization of clinical activities, and regular testing among healthcare practitioners, with better chances to grant patients protection. However, the lack of standardized informatic platforms results in serious challenges in replacing frontal visits, often making a concrete reduction of patients hospital accesses unfeasible.

We compared filter survival and citrate-induced complications during CRRT with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 patients. Methods: : In this retrospective study we included all consecutive adult patients (n=97) with acute kidney injury (AKI) treated with RCA-CRRT at seven ICUs of a tertiary university hospital over the tree month period. Medical data were collected to compare the efficacy and complications of RCA-CRRT between COVID-19 (n=44) and Non-COVID-19 patients (n=53). Results: : There was no significant difference in the number of CRRT filters used per patient in COVID-19 vs. Non-COVID-19 patients (median 5 vs 3 filters, p=0.103). Mean filter run-time was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to Non-COVID-19 patients (68.4 (95%CI 67.0-69.9) vs. 65.2 (95%CI 63.2-67.2) hours, respectively;log-rank 0.014). COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) throughout the CRRT due to systemic anticoagulation compared to Non-COVID-19 patients (54 (IQR 45 C 61) vs. 47 (IQR 41 - 58) seconds, respectively;p<0.001). A significantly higher incidence of combined metabolic disturbances (metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia and hypernatremia), consistent with reduced filter patency and citrate overload during RCA, was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to Non-COVID-19 patients (19.1% vs. 12.7%, respectively;p=0.04). These metabolic disarrangements were resistant to per-protocol adjustments and disappeared after replacement of the CRRT-filter. Conclusions: : In contrast to initial concerns, adequate filter life-span can be achieved with RCA during CRRT in COVID-19 patients. However, close monitoring of the acid-base balance appears warranted, as these patients tend to develop reduced filter patency leading to a higher incidence of citrate overload and metabolic disturbances.

METHODS Prior to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, we surveyed a convenience sample of 404 departing international travelers at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Presented with a hypothetical pandemic influenza scenario occurring overseas, the participants predicted their anticipated protective behaviors while abroad and recorded their attitudes toward potential screening measures at US ports of entry (POE). The survey also qualitatively explored factors that would influence compliance with health entry screening at POE. RESULTS Those who perceived pandemic influenza to be serious were more likely to state that they would be comfortable with screening (p = 0.006), and if they had influenza-like illness (ILI) overseas, would be more willing to see a physician and delay return travel (p = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively). Other demographic variables, including age and race, were associated with protective behaviors in response to ILI. Travelers also identified diverse information requirements which would influence their behavior in response to entry screening, including characteristics of the pandemic, severity of illness, and screening operations. CONCLUSIONS Demographic characteristics and perceived severity of illness are important factors that may influence the protective behaviors of travelers overseas.

These factors are thought to disproportionately affect populations at risk of psychopathology, such as adolescents with a history of childhood adversity (CA). Therefore, examining which factors may buffer the impact of COVID-19-related stress and isolation in vulnerable adolescents is critical. The Resilience After the COVID-19 Threat (REACT) study assesses whether emotion regulation capacity, inflammation and neuroimmune responses to stress induced in the laboratory prior to the pandemic predict responses to COVID-19-related social isolation and stress in adolescents with CA. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms that enable vulnerable adolescents to maintain or regain good mental health when confronted with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We recruited 79 adolescents aged 16C26 with CA experiences from the Resilience After Individual Stress Exposure study in which we assessed emotion regulation, neural and immune stress responses to an acute stress task. Our sample completed questionnaires at the start of the UK lockdown (baseline; April 2020) and three (July 2020) and 6 months later (October 2020) providing crucial longitudinal information across phases of the pandemic progression and government response. The questionnaires assess (1) mental health, (2) number and severity of life events, (3) physical health, (4) stress perception and (5) loneliness and friendship support.

Children further do not transmit the virus in any meaningful way. Despite these facts, many public health authorities recommend that all children above the age of 12 get vaccinated to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, many schools, colleges, and universities require proof of vaccination for students to attend class, essentially coercing students to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The rationale presented by public health officials for recommending COVID-19 vaccination for children is threefold: (a) To keep children from contracting COVID-19 and becoming seriously ill.

Consequently, this research investigates whether these hypotheses are correct and supported by the science and empirical data.

A more fast, efficient and less tedious method that allows mass blood sampling is necessary during a pandemic to quickly diagnose disease and obtain population serological data. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling has been used for several decades for the accurate detection of viral specific antibodies and remains one the most convenient methods for obtaining serological data on exposed patients.

DBS samples were collected from six patients (five control and one positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection) and patient serum was extracted and tested blindly using commercially available antibody test kits for Coxiella burnetti, parvovirus B19 and SARS-CoV-2. The results demonstrate that antibodies recovered from DBS after elution are comparable to those found in serum, indicating that serological tests can be adapted to test DBS samples from patients using our modified protocol. Because DBS sampling is a much faster and cheaper method of sampling blood, this modification could therefore allow for potential nationwide testing for epidemiological studies.","output":"Dried blood spots are an efficient blood sampling method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has affected lives, with very adverse outcomes in specific populations in the United States of America (USA), a high-income country, and two middle-income countries, Brazil and South Africa.

The information is based on data collected from infectious disease/epidemiological centers in the USA, Brazil, and South Africa. Adverse COVID-19 outcomes have been associated with the burden of exposure and disease, linked to socioeconomic determinants, among specific ethnicities in all three countries. The prevalence of comorbidities before and the likelihood of work-related exposure in the context of COVID-19 infection puts ethnic minorities in the USA and some ethnic majorities and minorities in Brazil and South Africa at greater risk.

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

The clinical parameters and EXO1 expression datasets of LUAD patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Oncomine and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to determine whether EXO1 expression was upregulated in LUAD. The correlation between EXO1 expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by Chi-square test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and COX regression models were adopted to analyze and verify the correlation of EXO1 expression with OS of LUAD patients for the exploration of prognostic value of EXO1 in LUAD patients. The signaling pathway related to EXO1 was predicted by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In addition, sera from LUAD patients and healthy subjects were collected, and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to detect EXO1 expression. EXO1 expression was upregulated in LUAD patients with respect to normal individuals. EXO1 expression was negatively correlated with the prognosis and thus could independently predict the prognosis of LUAD patients. EXO1 gene was involved in 128 signal pathways, of which 9 pathways may be closely related. EXO1 was highly expressed in the blood of LUAD patients. High EXO1 expression can serve as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, and the expression of serum EXO1 has certain diagnostic value for LUAD.","output":"Bioinformatics Analysis and Experimental Study of Exonuclease 1 Gene in Lung Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as a \\"vehicle\\" to administer aerosolized medication has attracted clinicians' interest in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the current evidence to answer the common questions raised by clinicians about this new aerosol delivery route and best practices of administration. Benefits of trans-nasal aerosol delivery include increased comfort, ability to speak, eat, and drink for patients while meeting a range of oxygen requirements, particularly for those who need to inhale aerosolized medication for long periods. Aerosol administration via HFNC has been shown to be well tolerated by children and adults, with comparable or better delivery efficacy than other interfaces, ranging from 2-20%. In vitro and in vivo scintigraphy studies among pediatric and adult populations reported that the inhaled dose delivered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer is 2 to 3 fold greater than that via a jet nebulizer. For adults, placement of nebulizer at the inlet of humidifier increases inhaled dose while reducing rainout obstructing nasal prongs. When HFNC gas flow is set below patient inspiratory flow, aerosol deposition is higher than when the gas flow exceeds patient inspiratory flow; thus, if tolerated, titrating down HFNC gas flow during trans-nasal aerosol delivery, with close monitoring and the use of unit dose with high concentration are recommended. Trans-nasal pulmonary aerosol delivery has not been shown to increase bioaerosols generated by patients, but gas flow may disperse aerosols. Placement of a surgical or procedure mask over HFNC might reduce aerosol dispersion.","output":"Narrative review of practical aspects of aerosol delivery via high-flow nasal cannula."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this unprecedented time, there are many questions and plenty of speculation surrounding what life will be like after the South African nationwide lockdown There is concern over the effects that the lockdown will have on worship services when churches are in a position to open their doors to the public once more As a result of recognising the lockdown as a liminal phase, perspectives are shared when considering how the church will gather again in a post-lockdown context and therefore a post-liminal phase One prevailing perspective in considering this post-liminal phase involves koinonia and how an undiscriminating virus can remind those to further practise inclusivity and ubuntu, by embracing sameness and difference when 'being church' In contrast, another important perspective focuses on ritualising certain measures in the worship service to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), when gathering in church buildings is permissible in a post-lockdown context This is concluded by echoing the spirit of ubuntu, namely, 'I am because we are', in 'being church' during and after the crisis of the COVID-19 global pandemic Contribution: From the perspective of Liturgical and Ritual Studies, this article aims to contribute to the Theological perspectives of COVID-19","output":"Worship in a post-lockdown context: A ritual-liturgical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated changes in dormancy and germination over 8 months for 23 common species (annual and perennial grasses, legumes and other dicotyledons) from herbaceous communities in northern Australia.

The species were divided into groups based on dormancy levels in seeds on the soil surface during the late dry and mid wet seasons. The dormancy characteristics of the groups were related to the ecology of the species in the groups.

To overcome these measurement challenges, we estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality, life expectancy and lifespan inequality from week 10 of 2020, when the first COVID-19 death was registered, to week 47 ending 20 November 2020 in England and Wales through an analysis of excess mortality. METHODS: We estimated age and sex-specific excess mortality risk and deaths above a baseline adjusted for seasonality with a systematic comparison of four different models using data from the Office for National Statistics. We additionally provide estimates of life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality defined as the SD in age at death. RESULTS: There have been 57 419 (95% prediction interval: 54 197, 60 752) excess deaths in the first 47 weeks of 2020, 55% of which occurred in men. Excess deaths increased sharply with age and men experienced elevated risks of death in all age groups. Life expectancy at birth dropped 0.9 and 1.2 years for women and men relative to the 2019 levels, respectively. Lifespan inequality also fell over the same period by 5 months for both sexes. CONCLUSION: Quantifying excess deaths and their impact on life expectancy at birth provide a more comprehensive picture of the burden of COVID-19 on mortality.

Computational molecular modeling was used to screen 3987 FDA approved drugs, and 47 drugs were selected to study their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 specific 3CLpro enzyme in vitro. Our results indicate that boceprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir, ivermectin, and micafungin exhibited inhibitory effect towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies showed that ivermectin may require homodimeric form of 3CLpro enzyme for its inhibitory activity.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HCV treatment regimens have transformative potential to address these co-occurring epidemics. Evaluation of innovative multi-modal approaches, integrating harm reduction, opioid agonist therapy (OAT), PrEP, and HCV treatment is required. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an on-site integrated care model where delivery of PrEP and HCV treatment for PWID takes places at syringe service programs (SSP) and OAT programs compared with referring PWID to clinical services in the community through a patient navigation model and to examine how structural factors interact with HIV prevention adherence and HCV treatment outcomes. METHODS: The Miami-Montreal Hepatitis C and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis trial (M(2)HepPrEP) is an open-label, multi-site, multi-center, randomized, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel treatment arms. A total of 500 persons who injected drugs in the prior 6 months and are eligible for PrEP will be recruited in OAT clinics and SSP in Miami, FL, and Montral, Qubec. Participants will be randomized to either on-site care, with adherence counseling, or referral to off-site clinics assisted by a patient navigator. PrEP will be offered to all participants and HCV treatment to those HCV-infected. Co-primary endpoints will be (1) adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis medication at 6 months post-randomization and (2) HCV sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks post-treatment completion among participants who were randomized within the HCV stratum. Up to 100 participants will be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview regarding perceptions of adherence barriers and facilitators, after their 6-month assessment. A simulation model-based cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed to determine the comparative value of the strategies being evaluated. DISCUSSION: The results of this study have the potential to demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of offering PrEP and HCV treatment in healthcare venues frequently attended by PWID. Testing the intervention in two urban centers with high disease burden among PWID, but with different healthcare system dynamics, will increase generalizability of findings.

The surveys deal with the issues of sexual behavior of Russian people. The topic of sexuality is tabooed no more, but remains sensitive, thus, men, people with an upper middle income, and with a higher education are more inclined to talk about sex in public. Sexual education and satisfaction with sex life are directly related to status, including not only money, profession, or gender, but mostly the presence of a permanent sexual partner. Despite the proliferation of traditional family values, it keeps being a basis for sexual well-being and a meaningful approach to intimate practices. The pandemic only reinforces the tendencies which have already been indicated: Those who have a partner turn out to be more successful in their intimate life than those who rely on fleeting or casual relationships. At the same time, the quality of intimate life for many people is reduced due to subjective factors (fear and stress), as well as to objective problems and losses (loss of a spouse, illness, etc.). The affection of these tendencies in the longer term has yet to be explored. A discussion about sexuality open to all ages, requires redefinition of intimate life in terms of tenderness, care, altruism and positive communication, the search for body language demonstrating attention to the other than direct sexual intercourse. Positive sexuality includes three basic elements: 1) the rejection of any violence and the priority of negotiation;2) acceptance of ones own body and its changes;3) lifelong sexual education as an experience of ones own mistakes as well as readiness for them. Such discourse on sexuality makes possible further studies of various social groups intimate life in Russia, making one of the factors of their subjective well-being less obscene. ? 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Imatinib Mesylate (IM) blocks Colony Stimulating Factor1 Receptor (CSF1R), the driver mechanism in TGCT. The aim of this study was to determine if IM reduces the tumour metabolic activity evaluated by PET-CT and to compare this response with the response seen on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS 25 Consecutive patients treated with IM (off label use) for locally advanced (N = 12) or recurrent (N = 13) diffuse-type TGCT were included, 15 male and median age at diagnosis 39 (IQR 31-47) years. The knee was most frequently affected (n = 16; 64%). The effect of IM was assessed pre- and post-IM treatment by comparing MR scans and PET-CT. MR scans were assessed by Tumour Volume Score (TVS), an estimation of the tumour volume as a percentage of the total synovial cavity. PET-CT scans were evaluated based on maximum standardized uptake value (SUV-max). Partial response was defined as more than 50% tumour reduction with TVS and a decrease of at least 30% on SUV-max. RESULTS Median duration of IM treatment was 7.0 (IQR 4.2-11.5) months. Twenty patients (80%) discontinued IM treatment for poor response or intended surgery. Twenty patients experienced an adverse event grade 1-2, three patients grade 3 (creatinine increment, neutropenic sepsis, liver dysfunction). MR assessment of all joints showed 32% (6/19) partial response and 63% (12/19) stable disease, with a mean difference of 12% (P = 0.467; CI -22.4-46.0) TVS between pre- and post-IM and a significant mean difference of 23% (P = 0.021; CI 4.2-21.6) in all knee lesions. PET-CT, all joints, showed a significantly decreased mean difference of 5.3 (P = 0.004; CI 1.9-8.7) SUV-max between pre- and post-IM treatment (58% (11/19) partial response, 37% (7/19) stable disease). No correlation between MR imaging and PET-CT could be appreciated in 15 patients with complete radiological data. CONCLUSION This study confirms the moderate radiological response of IM in diffuse-type TGCT. PET-CT is a valuable additional diagnostic tool to quantify response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Its value should be assessed further to validate its efficacy in the objective measurement of biological response in targeted systemic treatment of TGCT.","output":"The effect of Imatinib Mesylate in diffuse-type Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumours on MR imaging and PET-CT."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Review of our institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) data found higher rate of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) (2.5% vs. 1.1%).

A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity.

It is a highly complex disorder with an increasing prevalence and an unclear etiology. Consensus indicates that ASD arises as a genetically modulated, and environmentally influenced condition. Although pathogenic rare genetic variants are detected in around 20% of cases of ASD, no single factor is responsible for the vast majority of ASD cases or that explains their characteristic clinical heterogeneity. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that ASD susceptibility involves an interplay between genetic factors and environmental exposures. One such environmental exposure which has received significant attention in this regard is maternal immune activation (MIA) resulting from bacterial or viral infection during pregnancy. Reproducible rodent models of ASD are well-established whereby induction of MIA in pregnant dams, leads to offspring displaying neuroanatomical, functional, and behavioral changes analogous to those seen in ASD. Blockade of specific inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-17A during gestation remediates many of these observed behavioral effects, suggesting a causative or contributory role. Here, we review the growing body of animal and human-based evidence indicating that interleukin-17A may mediate the observed effects of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. This is particularly important given the current corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy is a potent stimulator of the maternal immune response, however the long-term effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on neurodevelopmental outcomes is unclear.

Haredi complied with community directives rather than with the national directive of hospitalizing COVID-19 patient only at public hospitals. Compliance with community directives was driven by a distrust in health authorities and clinicians at public hospitals; by the preference of patient-centered care, a desired approach of care that public hospitals fail to implement; by the need to sustain beliefs, values, and traditions; by community leadership; and by the need to conserve political power. While health authorities view underground home hospitals as demonstrating non-compliance with the national directive, Haredi leaders view underground home hospitals as demonstrating a self-sufficient, patient-centered care alternative to public hospitalizations. Considering the benefits of patient-centered care and the growth of the multi-cultural global landscape, we call upon health authorities to explore the accommodation of patient-centered care for COVID-19 patients and the designing of an adaptive multi-cultural policy that address multi-cultural aspects of religious minorities as key to health promotion.

To ensure that patient care is not compromised. To help us in areas of need in order to educate the staff regarding the techniques of PPE and thus ensure patient and staff safety and care during the pandemic. Method Novel coronavirus 2019 was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan in China. Since those initial few cases, it has rapidly proliferated to a global pandemic, putting an inordinate amount of strain on healthcare systems around the world. We believe that the technique of donning and doffing if followed as per PHE guidelines would be of help in both preventing the infection and improve the care and safety of both patients and staff. This Audit includes both In-patient and Out-patient units in Psychiatric services across North Wales. Data were collected from 19 units out of 39. We observed covertly 325 staff members belonging to various cadres. Apart from the Donning and Doffing techniques, we also observed the availability of designated areas for this purpose and the availability of PPE as well. Data collection was by junior and senior doctors from various sites of the mental health unit in North Wales. A proforma was provided, the standards were based on PHE guidelines. Result It was noted that just about 50% of the staff followed donning as per guidance. Amongst all three sites, the Central team showed a better adherence with 85% of them donning PPE correctly. whereas only 22% adhered to donning in the West team. Only 21% of them managed to doff PPE as per guidance amongst all 3 centres in North Wales. It was also noted that there are no designated areas to Don and Doff in outpatient units. Staff, in general, seem to not adhere to the guidance of utilising a mask, especially when within 2 meters distance of other staff. Conclusion We will be presenting the Audit at the regional meeting. After discussion with the infection prevention control team and Health and safety lead, we intend to improvise the wards with designated areas for donning and doffing. Teaching sessions for the staff in all three sites, reminders in various areas of the community mental health units and inpatient units. We are hoping that these recommendations will help us in achieving our aim of health and safety during this pandemic.","output":"Adherence to Public Health England (PHE) guidance for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in north Wales mental health unit- a regional audit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic. More than a hundred million people are already impacted, with infected numbers expected to go up. Coughing, sneezing, and even talking emit respiratory droplets which can carry infectious viruses. It is important to understand how the exhaled particles move through air to an exposed person to better predict the airborne transmission impacts of SARS-CoV-2. There are many studies conducted on the airborne spread of viruses causing diseases such as SARS and measles; however, there are very limited studies that couple the transport characteristics with the aerosol dynamics of the droplets. In this study, a comprehensive model for simultaneous droplet evaporation and transport due to diffusion, convection, and gravitational settling is developed to determine the near spatial and temporal concentration of the viable virus exhaled by the infected individual. The exposure to the viable virus is estimated by calculating the respiratory deposition, and the risk of infection is determined using a dose-response model. The developed model is used to quantify the risk of short-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inhalation of virus-laden droplets when an infected individual is directly in front of the person exposed and the surrounding air is stagnant. The effect of different parameters, such as viral load, infectivity factor, emission sources, physical separation, exposure time, ambient air velocity, dilution, and mask usage, is determined on the risk of exposure.","output":"Aerosol Dynamics Model for Estimating the Risk from Short-Range Airborne Transmission and Inhalation of Expiratory Droplets of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is among the most prevalent complications of influenza. The purpose of this study is to quantify the burden of pneumonia among hospitalized patients with influenza. METHODS: Real-world retrospective data from 01JAN2014-30JUN2019 (study period) were obtained from Optums de-identified Clinformatics? Data Mart Database (2007C2020) for patients who had  1 diagnosis for influenza during the identification period and  1 all-cause inpatient visit within 1 day of diagnosis. Cases had  1 diagnosis claim for an influenza-related pneumonia within the 30 days after the initial influenza diagnosis date. Controls had no evidence of influenza-related pneumonia in the 30 days following the initial influenza diagnosis. Final 1:1 matching was determined using propensity score matching (PSM). Statistical significance between the cohorts was tested. RESULTS: After PSM, there were 4878 hospitalized patients with influenza in each of the case and control groups. During the index hospitalization, cases vs. controls had longer length of stay [Mean (standard deviation): 6.5 (8.3) vs. 1.9 (3.7)], greater intensive care unit (ICU) use (38.4 vs. 16.8%), and greater mechanical ventilation use (invasive: 11.4 vs. 2.3%; non-invasive: 6.8 vs. 2.6%) (all p < 0.001). Cases also had higher readmission rates than controls (12.3 vs. 3.5% within 30 days; 20.0 vs. 6.1% within 90 days; p < 0.001 for both). Post-index date direct all-cause healthcare costs were higher for cases than for controls (median total cost: $18,428 vs. $621 for 30 days; $21,774 vs. $3312 for 90 days; $25,960 vs. $8699 for 6 months; $35,875 vs. $21,619 for 1 year; all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia as a complication of influenza increases risk of mortality and leads to greater healthcare resource use and direct medical costs among patients hospitalized with influenza. These effects are seen early during the index hospitalization and within the first 30 days after diagnosis, but their impact continues throughout a year of follow-up.

The high number of cases of the Coronavirus has led to an increase in the number of patients in hospitals. Nurses are health workers who have the most frequent contact with patients, and have challenges to continue to provide professional nursing care at the risk of contracting or becoming a victim of COVID-19. This study aims to identify the experiences of nurses while caring for patients with COVID-19. This study is a qualitative research with a phenomenological approach that was carried out at the Jambi City Hospital from September 2020 to August 2021. The population in this study was nurses who served at the COVID-19 referral hospital. The sampling technique was purposive sampling with 13 participants, data collection was done by in-depth interviews, via telephone, and observation. The data collected were analyzed by the Creswell method. Based on the results of the study, five themes were obtained, namely Knowledge about COVID-19, Loyalty in caring for COVID-19 patients, Attention to caring for COVID-19 patients, Efforts to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, and support from hospital management and families for nurses. The conclusion of this study is that the professionalism of nurses remains the main thing in treating COVID-19 patients even though nurses are overshadowed by feelings of fear and anxiety when treating COVID-19 patients. Efforts that need to be made are training related to the latest COVID-19 health care services, family and social support, as well as mentoring and improving the spirituality of nurses.

Conduit vessel function [brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD)], carotid and femoral artery blood flow and shear rate (SR), and arterial stiffness [carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), augmentation index (AIx@75), -stiffness index, and arterial compliance] were evaluated. Compared with CON, AE and AB increased FMD at 30 min and 90 min (interaction: p < 0.05); AB decreased carotid artery blood flow and SR at 30 min, while both AE and AB increased femoral artery blood flow and SR at 30 min and 90 min (interaction: p < 0.05); AE and AB decreased cf-PWV and AIx@75 at 30 min and 90 min (interaction: p < 0.05); and AE improved both carotid and femoral -stiffness index and arterial compliance, while AB reduced -stiffness index and increased arterial compliance only in the femoral artery (interaction: p < 0.05). These findings suggest that ankle bathing may serve as an alternative strategy for enhancing vascular function. Novelty: We observed similar improvements in conduit vessel function, femoral artery blood flow and shear rate, and arterial stiffness following ankle bathing and acute aerobic exercise in young adults. These findings have identified ankle bathing as a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing vascular function, which may be particularly relevant for those with limited ability to engage in regular aerobic exercise.","output":"Comparison of the acute effects of ankle bathing versus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on vascular function in young adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Table: see text] SUMMARY: This review discusses the varying roles that have been played by many plant\\\\viral regulatory sequences and proteins in the creation of plant\\\\based expression systems and virus particles for use in nanotechnology.

Objective: To assess clinical outcomes with convalescent plasma treatment vs placebo or standard of care in peer-reviewed and preprint publications or press releases of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Data Sources: PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection: The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10a?722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a supportive therapy to improve outcomes but evidence-based guidelines have not been defined. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Initial mortality rates associated with ECMO for ARDS in COVID-19 were high, leading some to believe that there was no role for ECMO in this viral illness. With more experience, outcomes have improved. The ideal candidate, timing of cannulation, and best post-cannulation management strategy, however, has not yet been defined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review from April 1 to July 31 2020 of the first 25 patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS placed on V-V ECMO at our institution. We analyzed the differences between survivors to hospital discharge and those who died. Modified Poisson regression was used to model adjusted risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: 44% of patients (11/25) survived to hospital discharge. Survivors were significantly younger (40.5 years vs. 53.1 years; p < 0.001) with no differences between cohorts in mean body mass index, diabetes, or PaO2:FiO2 at cannulation. Survivors had shorter duration from symptom onset to cannulation (12.5 days vs. 19.9 days, p = 0.028) and shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) prior to cannulation (5.6 days vs. 11.7 days, p = 0.045). Each day from ICU admission to cannulation increased the adjusted risk of death by 4% and each year increase in age increased the adjusted risk 6%. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO has a role in severe, refractory ARDS associated with COVID-19. Increasing age and time from ICU admission were risk factors for mortality and should be considered in patient selection. Further studies are needed to define best practices for V-V ECMO use in COVID-19.","output":"Time to Cannulation after ICU Admission Increases Mortality for Patients Requiring Veno-Venous ECMO for COVID-19 Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Diamond Princess cruise ship was the site of a large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were 70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics.

A range of formats are used by health campaigns to correct beliefs but data on their effectiveness is limited. We aimed to identify A) whether three commonly used myth-busting formats are effective for COVID-19 myths, immediately and after a delay, and B) which is the most effective. Methods: We tested whether three common correction formats could reduce beliefs in COVID-19 myths: (i) question-answer, ii) fact-only, (ii) fact-myth. n = 2215 participants ( n =1291 after attrition), UK representative of age and gender, were randomly assigned to one of the three formats. n = 11 myths were acquired from fact-checker websites and piloted to ensure believability. Participants rated myth belief at baseline, were shown correction images (the intervention), and then rated myth beliefs immediately post-intervention and after a delay of at least 6 days. A partial replication, n = 2084 UK representative, was also completed with immediate myth rating only. Analysis used mixed models with participants and myths as random effects. Results: Myth agreement ratings were significantly lower than baseline for all correction formats, both immediately and after the delay;all ¡s > 0.30, p s < .001. Thus all formats were effective at lowering beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation.Correction formats only differed where baseline myth agreement was high, with question-answer and fact-myth more effective than fact-only immediately;=0.040, p =.022 (replication set:  = 0.053, p = .0075) and  = -0.051, p = .0059 (replication set: =-0.061, p < .001), respectively.

Conclusion: Our results imply that COVID-19 myths can be effectively corrected using materials and formats typical of health campaigns. Campaign designers can use our results to choose between correction formats. When myth belief was high, question-answer format, in which the reader is invited to consider whether a myth is true, had a more lasting effect than a traditional fact-myth format.","output":"COVID-19 myth-busting: an experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cosmetic dermal fillers are a sought-after procedure globally.

This paper addresses these questions by examining how Western citizens ascribe responsibility and action in relation to corporate misconduct. Empirically, it focuses on modern slavery and analyses online debates in Denmark on child slavery in the cocoa industry. Conceptually, it introduces the notion of cosmopolitanism as a general disposition of care and responsibility towards distant others, conceived as a prerequisite for the critical evaluation of corporate (ir)responsibility in the Global South. The analysis of online debates shows that citizens debate child slavery in terms of individual consumer responsibility rather than corporate responsibility. Corporations are not considered potential agents of change.

When disease is present, the barrier between the pulmonary circulation and the airway epithelium is damaged, allowing serum proteins to enter the airways. We identified that human glycated albumin (GA) is a molecule in human serum that triggers an inflammatory response in human airway epithelial cultures. We observed that single-donor human serum induced IL-8 secretion from primary human airway epithelial cells and from a cystic fibrosis airway cell line (CF1-16) in a dose-dependent manner. IL-8 secretion from airway epithelial cells was time dependent and rapidly increased in the first 4 h of incubation. Stimulation with GA promoted epithelial cells to secrete IL-8, and this increase was blocked by the anti-GA antibody. The IL-8 secretion induced by serum GA was 10C50-fold more potent than TNF() or LPS stimulation. GA also has a functional effect on airway epithelial cells in vitro, increasing ciliary beat frequency. Our results demonstrate that the serum molecule GA is pro-inflammatory and triggers host defense responses including increases in IL-8 secretion and ciliary beat frequency in the human airway epithelium. Although the binding site of GA has not yet been described, it is possible that GA could bind to the receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE), known to be expressed in the airway epithelium; however, further experiments are needed to identify the mechanism involved. We highlight a possible role for GA in airway inflammation.","output":"Glycated Albumin Triggers an Inflammatory Response in the Human Airway Epithelium and Causes an Increase in Ciliary Beat Frequency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is having a dramatic effect on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). Upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government dispatched about 42 000 HCWs to Wuhan City and Hubei Province to fight this pandemic. This study briefly examines front-line nurses who experienced burnout, with the main objective of investigating the mediating roles of positive and negative affect in the relationship between resilience and burnout in Wuhan hospitals at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 180 front-line nurses voluntarily participated via a social media group. They completed the online questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), demographics, and work-related characteristics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was used to examine the mediating effect of positive and negative affect on the relationship between resilience and burnout. The total prevalence of burnout was 51.7%, of which 15.0% were severe burnout. These preliminary results revealed that positive and negative affect fully mediated the effects of resilience on burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment of front-line nurses. It is necessary to know the impact of resilience on HCWs with burnout through the positive and negative affect of individual backgrounds and situations, and how policymakers can deploy resilience interventions to support front-line HCWs.","output":"Association between resilience and burnout of front-line nurses at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic: Positive and negative affect as mediators in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A video of the chest computed tomography of a 55-year-old woman, showing the miliary pattern caused by lung adenocarcinoma with an I EGFR i mutation, is in Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.211410/tab-related-content Clinical images are chosen because they are particularly intriguing, classic or dramatic.

Cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) have been identified as privileged scaffolds to enable and inhibit thiol-mediated uptake because they can act as dynamic covalent cascade exchangers, i.e., every exchange produces a new, covalently tethered exchanger. In this study, our focus is on the essentially unexplored COCs of higher oxidation levels. Quantitative characterization of the underlying dynamic covalent exchange cascades reveals that the initial ring opening of cyclic thiosulfonates (CTOs) proceeds at a high speed even at a low pH. The released sulfinates exchange with disulfides in aprotic but much less in protic environments. Hydrophobic domains were thus introduced to direct CTOs into hydrophobic pockets to enhance their reactivity. Equipped with such directing groups, fluorescently labeled CTOs entered the cytosol of living cells more efficiently than the popular asparagusic acid. Added as competitive agents, CTOs inhibit the uptake of various COC transporters and SARS-CoV-2 lentivectors. Orthogonal trends found with different transporters support the existence of multiple cellular partners to account for the diverse expressions of thiol-mediated uptake. Dominant self-inhibition and high activity of dimers imply selective and synergistic exchange in hydrophobic pockets as distinguishing characteristics of thiol-mediated uptake with CTOs. The best CTO dimers with hydrophobic directing groups inhibit the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 lentivectors with an IC50 significantly lower than the previous best CTO, below the 10 M threshold and better than ebselen. Taken together, these results identify CTOs as an intriguing motif for use in cytosolic delivery, as inhibitors of lentivector entry, and for the evolution of dynamic covalent networks in the broadest sense, with reactivity-based selectivity of cascade exchange emerging as a distinguishing characteristic that deserves further attention.","output":"Cyclic Thiosulfonates for Thiol-Mediated Uptake: Cascade Exchangers, Transporters, Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated to neuromuscular symptoms in up to 10.7% of hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, the extent of muscular involvement in infected subjects with no signs of myopathy has never been assessed with neurophysiological investigations. METHODS: Over a 3-week period  from April 30 through May 20, 2020  a total of 70 patients were hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Ward of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. After excluding patients who underwent invasive ventilation and steroid treatment, 12 patients were evaluated. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) included the analysis of conduction velocity, amplitude, and latency for bilateral motor tibial, ulnar nerves, and sensory sural and radial nerves. Unilateral concentric-needle electromyography (EMG) was performed evaluating at least 4 areas of 8 selected muscles. For each muscle, spontaneous activity at rest, morphology, and recruitment of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were evaluated. RESULTS: While nerve conduction studies were unremarkable, needle electromyography showed myopathic changes in 6 out of 12 subjects. All patients were asymptomatic for muscular involvement. Clinical features and laboratory findings did not show relevant differences between patients with and without myopathic changes. CONCLUSION: Our data show that in SARS-CoV-2 infection muscular involvement can occur despite the absence of clinical signs or symptoms and should be considered part of the disease spectrum. The application of muscle biopsy to unravel the mechanisms of myofiber damage on tissue specimens could help to clarify the pathogenesis and the treatment response of coronavirus-mediated injury.

Findings showed factors important to program sustainability were: 1) Program fit (finding caregivers in the community); and 2) Local VA facility support (staffing, adaptation, and local leadership support). COVID prompted losing some caregivers and prevented others from joining. Program staffing was not impacted as many program activities ceased. Recreational therapists (RTs) were significant to maintaining Veterans well-being and reducing social isolation through virtual activities.

Predictive models developed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and based on timely, centralized and standardized real world patient data could improve management of COVID-19 to achieve better clinical outcomes. The objectives of this manuscript are to describe the structure and technologies used to construct a COVID-19 Data Mart architecture and to present how a large hospital has tackled the challenge of supporting daily management of COVID-19 pandemic emergency, by creating a strong retrospective knowledge base, a real time environment and integrated information dashboard for daily practice and early identification of critical condition at patient level. This framework is also used as an informative, continuously enriched data lake, which is a base for several on-going predictive studies. METHODS: : The information technology framework for clinical practice and research was described. It was developed using SAS Institute software analytics tool and SAS? Vyia? environment and Open-Source environment R ? and Python ? for fast prototyping and modelling. The included variables and the source extraction procedures were presented. RESULTS: : The Data Mart covers a retrospective cohort of 2634 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. People who died were older, had more comorbidities, reported more frequently dyspnea at onset, had higher d-dimer, C-reactive protein and urea nitrogen. The dashboard was developed to support the management of COVID-19 patients at three levels: hospital, single ward and individual care level. INTERPRETATION: : The COVID-19 Data Mart based on integration of a large collection of clinical data and an AI-based integrated framework has been developed, based on a set of automated procedures for data mining and retrieval, transformation and integration, and has been embedded in the clinical practice to help managing daily care. Benefits from the availability of a Data Mart include the opportunity to build predictive models with a machine learning approach to identify undescribed clinical phenotypes and to foster hospital networks. A real-time updated dashboard built from the Data Mart may represent a valid tool for a better knowledge of epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19, especially when multiple waves are observed, as well as for epidemic and pandemic events of the same nature (e. g. with critical clinical conditions leading to severe pulmonary inflammation). Therefore, we believe the approach presented in this paper may find several applications in comparable situations even at region or state levels. Finally, models predicting the course of future waves or new pandemics could largely benefit from network of DataMarts.","output":"A REAL-TIME INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION MAKING FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Following this, the instant CFR was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. RESULTS: In China, the instant CFR of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from January 1 to January 17; it then declined gradually and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average CFR in China was 6.12.9%, while the CFR was 1.00.4% in China except Hubei Province. The cure rate of COVID-19 was 93.92.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.00.4% in China except Hubei Province.

In this study, we investigated the suitability of Advax?, a stable particulate polymorph of inulin, also referred to as delta inulin, as a mucosal adjuvant for whole inactivated influenza vaccine (WIV) administered either as a liquid or dry powder formulation. Spray freeze-drying produced Advax-adjuvanted WIV powder particles in a size range (1C5 m) suitable for inhalation. The physical and biological characteristics of both WIV and Advax remained unaltered both by admixing WIV with Advax and by spray freeze drying. Upon intranasal or pulmonary immunization, both liquid and dry powder formulations containing Advax induced significantly higher systemic, mucosal and cellular immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulations. Furthermore, pulmonary immunization with Advax-adjuvanted WIV led to robust memory B cell responses along with an increase of lung localization factors i.e. CXCR3, CD69, and CD103. A less pronounced but still positive effect of Advax was seen on memory T cell responses. In contrast to animals immunized with WIV alone, all animals pulmonary immunized with a single dose of Advax-adjuvanted WIV were fully protected with no visible clinical symptoms against a lethal dose of influenza virus. These data confirm that Advax is a potent mucosal adjuvant that boosts vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses both in the lung and systemically with major positive effects on B-cell memory and complete protection against live virus. Hence, respiratory tract immunization, particularly via the lungs, with Advax-adjuvanted WIV formulation as a liquid or dry powder is a promising alternative to parenteral influenza vaccination.","output":"Advax augments B and T cell responses upon influenza vaccination via the respiratory tract and enables complete protection of mice against lethal influenza virus challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO declaration on 11th March 2020 of COVID 19 as a global pandemic and the forecast by Imperial College, London of 20,000 expected deaths in UK, there was intense pressure on the intensive care units in the UK to increase their capacity and services.

The influenza A virus genome consists of negative sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA. Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface antigens known as hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The main problem with influenza A viruses infecting humans is drug resistance, which is caused by antigenic changes. A few antiviral drugs are available, but the most popular is the neuraminidase inhibitor  oseltamivir. The resistance against this drug has probably developed through antigenic drift by a point mutation in one amino acid at position 275 (H275Y). In order to prevent a possible influenza pandemic it is necessary to develop fast diagnostic tests. The aim of this project was to develop a new test for detection of influenza A virus and determination of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity in humans. Detection and differentiation of oseltamivir resistance/sensitivity of influenza A virus was based on real-time PCR. This test contains two TaqMan probes, which work at different wavelengths. Application of techniques like multiplex real-time PCR has greatly enhanced the capability for surveillance and characterization of influenza viruses.

This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.","output":"Independent representations of self-motion and object location in barrel cortex output."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wellness in adult workers is intimately associated with better quality of life in individuals, as well as in the family, community, workplace, and country.

This study explored UK womens experiences of accessing pertussis vaccination during pregnancy and infant vaccinations during COVID-19. MethodsAn online cross-sectional survey was completed, between 3rd August-11 th October 2020, by 1404 women aged 16+ years who were pregnant at some point after the first UK lockdown from March 23rd, 2020. Ten follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted. ResultsMost women surveyed were pregnant (65.7%) and a third postnatal (34.3%). Almost all women (95.6%) were aware that pertussis vaccination is recommended in pregnancy. Most pregnant (72.1%) and postnatal women (84.0%) had received pertussis vaccination; however, access issues were reported. Over a third (39.6%) of women had a pregnancy vaccination appointment changed. COVID-19 made it physically difficult to access pregnancy vaccinations for one fifth (21.5%) of women and physically difficult to access infant vaccinations for almost half of women (45.8%). Nearly half of women (45.2%) reported feeling less safe attending pregnancy vaccinations and over three quarters (76.3%) less safe attending infant vaccinations due to COVID-19. The majority (94.2%) felt it was important to get their baby vaccinated during COVID-19. Pregnant women from ethnic-minorities and lower-income households were less likely to have been vaccinated. Minority-ethnicity women were more likely to report access problems and feeling less safe attending vaccinations for both themselves and their babies. Qualitative analysis found women experienced difficulties accessing antenatal care and relied on knowledge from previous pregnancies to access vaccines in pregnancy.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and death in a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism compared to a control population cohort, during the epidemic bout (March-May 2020) in Bologna, northern Italy. METHOD: Participants of the ParkLink study with the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism, and people anonymously matched (ratio 1:10) for sex, age, district, Charlson Index were included. The hospital admission rate for COVID-19 (February 26 - May 31, 2020) and the death rate for any cause were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: The ParkLink cohort included 696 subjects with Parkinson's disease and 184 with parkinsonism; the control cohort 8,590 subjects. The 3-month hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 0.6% in Parkinson's disease, 3.3% in parkinsonism, 0.7% in controls. The adjusted hazard ratio (age, sex, district, Charlson Index) was 0.8 (95% CI 0.3-2.3, p=0.74) in Parkinson's disease and 3.3 (1.4-7.6, p=0.006) in parkinsonism compared to controls. Twenty-nine of the infected subjects died; 30-day fatality rate was 35.1%, without difference among the three groups. Six out of ten Parkinson's disease/parkinsonism patients had the infection during hospitalization or in nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease per-se probably is not a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization. Conversely, parkinsonism is an independent risk factor probably due to a more severe health status, entailing a higher care dependency and the placement in high infection risk accommodations.

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met and transforming growth factor- (TGF-)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, TGF-/EGFR signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether HGF/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in AECs are regulated by HGF/c-Met and TGF-/EGFR. We hypothesized that HGF/c-Met and TGF-/EGFR would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human AECs. We found that recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) and rhTGF- stimulated primary human AECs to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly and IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs plated on rat-tail collagen through EGFR activation likely by TGF- released from AECs and through c-Met activated by HGF secreted from lung fibroblasts. HGF secretion by fibroblasts was stimulated by AEC production of prostaglandin E(2) during influenza infection. We conclude that HGF/c-Met and TGF-/EGFR signaling enhances the innate immune responses by human AECs during influenza infections.","output":"Influenza induces IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by human alveolar epithelial cells through HGF/c-Met and TGF-/EGFR signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design:This briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context.Purpose:This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.Findings:This briefing considers the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and what areas continue to struggle to identify a new normal.Originality:The briefing saves busy executives, strategists and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format.","output":"The new normal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The core symptoms of narcolepsy such as excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are well known. However, there is mounting evidence for a much broader symptom spectrum, including psychiatric symptoms. Disordered sleep has previously been linked with dissociative symptoms, which may imply that patients with narcolepsy are more prone to develop such symptoms. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of dissociative symptoms in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to population controls. Methods: In a retrospective case control study, sixty adult patients fulfilling the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and 120 matched population control subjects received a structured interview using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) to assess dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: A majority of narcolepsy patients reported dissociative symptoms, and even fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria of a dissociative disorder (62% vs 1% in controls, p < .001). Most frequently reported symptoms were \\"dissociative amnesia\\" (37% vs 1%, p < .001) and \\"dissociative disorder of voluntary movement\\" (32% vs 1%, p < .001). Conclusion: Dissociative symptoms are strikingly prevalent in adult patients with narcolepsy type 1. Although a formal diagnosis of dissociation disorder should not be made as the symptoms can be explained by narcolepsy as an underlying condition, the findings do illustrate the extent and severity of the dissociative symptoms. As for the pathophysiological mechanism, there may be symptom overlap between narcolepsy and dissociation disorder. However, there may also be a more direct link between disrupted sleep and dissociative symptoms. In either case, the high frequency of occurrence of dissociative symptoms should result in an active inquiry by doctors, to improve therapeutic management and guidance.","output":"Dissociative Symptoms are Highly Prevalent in Adults with Narcolepsy Type 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Partnering with grassroots organizations creates the link between institutions and communities, vital to addressing inequities and building long term resilience.

The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of self-reported active cigarette smoking, waterpipe use, and potential job-related sources of CO to the level of exhaled CO in firefighters. METHODS: We surveyed the personnel of 18 fire stations (N = 842), median age 28 years, who participated at an annual screening not timed to coincide with recent firefighting. We surveyed smoking and waterpipe history, exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS), use of coal for health and biomass for cooking and time since last exposure to firefighting in the workplace. We measured exhaled CO with an instantaneous reading device (piCO Smokerlyzer). We used multivariable regression models to test the association of time since last smoked cigarette (12 h) and waterpipe (12 h) and time since last fire (6 h) with exhaled CO. RESULTS: In analysis limited to men (93.5% of all surveyed), 42% were daily cigarette; 1% were waterpipe smokers; 94% were exposed to SHS, 29% used coal for heating and 4% used biomass for cooking. The median CO was 4 (interquartile range 3;8) ppm. Age (beta 0.74 per 10 years, p < 0.001), use of biomass fuel for cooking (beta 1.38, p = 0.05), cigarette smoked in the last 12 h (beta 8.22, p < 0.001), waterpipe smoked in the last 12 h (beta 23.10, p < 0.001) were statistically associated with CO, but not time since last fire (6 h) (beta 4.12, p = 0.12). There was a significant interaction between older age and firefighting for exhaled CO (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette and recent waterpipe smoking are associated with increased exhaled CO in firefighters. Firefighting itself was a less potent contributor to exhaled CO when measured at an annual screening, but an age interaction was manifested.

Most common causes for smell loss are sinunasal disease (chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps), acute infections of the upper airways, head trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders. In many people smell loss seems to be due to the aging process. Before treatment olfactory disorders are diagnosed according to cause with the medical history being a big portion of the diagnostic process. Olfactory disorders are in principle reversible, with a relatively high degree of spontaneous improvement in olfactory loss following infections of the upper respiratory tract. Medical treatment is according to cause. It also involves surgical approaches as well as conservative treatments including the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, or smell training.

Then, the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is chosen for prediction. The secondary decomposition algorithm is innovatively introduced into the field of carbon emission prediction, and the empirical results illustrate that the secondary decomposition technology can further improve the prediction accuracy. Combined with the secondary decomposition, the R(2), MAPE, and RMSE of the model are improved by 2.20%, 43.08%, and 36.92% on average.

Research from past decades has suggested minimum open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA) volume requirements for surgeons (9-13 OAAA/year) and hospitals (18 OAAA/year) to purportedly achieve acceptable results. Given concerns regarding the decreased frequency of open repairs in the endovascular era, we examined the association of surgeon and hospital volume with 30- and 90-day mortality in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective OAAA repair between 2013-2018 were identified in the VQI registry. We cross-sectionally evaluated the association of average hospital and surgeon volume with 30-day postoperative mortality using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Cross-level interaction was permitted and random surgeon- and hospital-level intercepts were used to account for clustering. Mortality results were adjusted by standardizing to the observed distribution of relevant covariates in the overall cohort. Outcomes were compared to the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines recommended criteria of <5% perioperative mortality. RESULTS: 3,078 patients underwent elective OAAA repair by 520 surgeons at 128 hospitals. The 30- and 90-day risks of postoperative mortality were 4.1% (n=126) and 5.4% (n=166), respectively. Mean surgeon volume and hospital volume were both inversely correlated with 30-day mortality. Averaged across all patients and hospitals, there was a 96% probability that surgeons who performed an average of &#8805;4 repairs per year achieved <5% 30-day mortality. There was substantial interplay between surgeon volume and hospital volume. For example, at lower volume hospitals performing an average of 5 repairs per year, <5% 30-day mortality would be expected 69% of the time for surgeons performing an average of 3 operations per year. Conversely, at higher volume hospitals performing an average of 40 repairs per year, a <5% 30-day mortality would be expected 96% of the time by surgeons performing an average 3 operations annually. As hospital volume increased, there was diminishing difference in 30-day mortality between lower and higher volume surgeons. Likewise, as surgeon volume increased, there was diminishing difference in 30-day mortality between lower and higher volume hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons and hospitals in the VQI registry achieved mortality outcomes below 5% (SVS guidelines) with an average surgeon volume that was substantially lower compared with previous reports. Further, when considering minimal surgeon volume guidelines, it is important to contextualize outcomes within hospital volumes.","output":"Association and Interplay of Surgeon and Hospital Volume with Mortality Following Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in the Modern Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, the issue of development of the tourism industry is becoming increasingly relevant, as this industry is an important component of the economic system of each country.

While it has not yet ended, COVID-19 has already created transitions in health care, one of which is a decrease in medical use for health-related issues other than COVID-19 infection. Korean soldiers are relatively homogeneous in terms of age and physical condition. They show a similar disease distribution pattern every year and are directly affected by changes in government attempts to control COVID-19 with nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to identify the changes in patterns of outpatient visits and admissions to military hospitals for a range of disease types during a pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient attendance and admission data from all military hospitals in South Korea from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed. Only active enlisted soldiers aged 18C32 years were included. Outpatient visits where there was a diagnosis of pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection, infectious conjunctivitis, infectious enteritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and fractures were analyzed. Admissions for pneumonia, acute enteritis, and fractures were also analyzed. All outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 for each disease were counted on a weekly basis and compared with the average number of visits over the same period of each year from 2016 to 2019. The corrected value was calculated by dividing the ratio of total weekly number of outpatient visits or admissions to the corresponding medical department in 2020 to the average in 2016C2019. RESULTS: A total of 5,813,304 cases of outpatient care and 143,022 cases of admission were analyzed. For pneumonia, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). The results were similar for outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory tract infection and infectious conjunctivitis (P < 0.001), while the corrected number of outpatient visits for infectious enteritis showed a significant increase in 2020 (P = 0.005). The corrected number of outpatient visits for asthma in 2020 did not differ from the average of the previous 4 years but the number of visits for the other allergic diseases increased significantly (P < 0.001). For fractures, the observed and corrected numbers of outpatient visits and admissions in 2020 decreased significantly compared with the average of other years (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient visits to military hospitals for respiratory and conjunctival infections and fractures decreased, whereas visits for allergic diseases did not change or increased only slightly. Admissions for pneumonia decreased significantly in 2020, while those for acute enteritis and fractures also decreased, but showed an increased proportion compared with previous years. These results are important because they illustrate the changing patterns in lifestyle as a result of public encouragement to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic and their effect on medical needs for both infectious and noninfectious diseases in a select group.","output":"Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Medical Use of Military Hospitals in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Fulminant hepatic failure due to acetaminophen toxicity is one of the most common indications for orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) in the acute setting However, it's unknown whether infection with COVID-19 has any effect on successful OLT We report a rare case of OLT in a COVID-19 patient who presented with acetaminophen overdose METHODS: The patient was a 27-year-old woman who came to the hospital with one week of abdominal pain along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea She reportedly had been taking over 8000 mg Tylenol per day for one week in order to continue working Her acetaminophen level was 42mg/ mL and she was started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) She was tested for COVID-19 per hospital protocol and was positive She denied any recent sick contacts, however, it was eventually determined that the patient cared for her significant other who had COVID-19 about two months prior to her hospitalization The patient's Tylenol levels improved with NAC, but her LFTs significantly increased with AST 14,841 and ALT 11,271 and her coagulation profile worsened with an INR of 4 4 Given her stable respiratory status and elevated LFTs she was deemed to not be a candidate for Remdesivir, per the infectious diseases team recommendations The patient was subsequently transferred to a tertiary medical center for further management With worsening mental status, she was started on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for hyperammonemia and intubated for airway protection CT brain was concerning for cerebral edema and a bolt was placed for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and management Due to the patient's fulminant liver failure and worsening clinical condition, she was approved for a liver transplant COVID-19 test on the day of transplant and was negative However, it was assumed that she had a positive viral load and was treated as such The patient received COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy the day after her transplant The patient remained intubated until post-op day 5 when her ICPs normalized and she met criteria for extubation The patient's renal function subsequently improved and she was discharged in stable condition RESULTS: This is thought to be the first liver transplant in a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and describes its management","output":"Liver transplant in an accidental acetaminophen overdose with covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is limited research examining the perception of exertion during exercise while wearing a facemask. The current study examined if mask usage during moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) changed the self-reported perception of exertion. Seventy-two adults (18 years and older) who were physically active before the COVID-19 pandemic completed a questionnaire that assessed exercise habits and perceptions of mask wearing during MVPA. Participants reported their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE, on a scale of 1C10) while exercising. Wearing a mask resulted in higher RPE vs. no mask during both vigorous (8.4  0.2 vs. 7.4  0.1;p < 0.001) and moderate PA (6.6  0.2 vs. 5.6  0.2;p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis revealed mostly negative perceptions of exercising while wearing a mask, including respiratory issues, detriments to cardiovascular endurance, and general discomfort. A total of 40% of participants reported that they stopped exercising in an indoor/public setting because of a mask mandate in their region. Participants reported participating in less vigorous PA (4.7  0.4 vs. 4.0  0.4 h/week;p = 0.046), but not less moderate PA (3.3  0.3 vs. 3.0  0.3 h/week;p = 0.443) pre vs. during the pandemic.

Little is known about the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem when administered by continuous infusion (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of two dosages of meropenem (3 g vs 6 g/day by CI) in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: Thirty-one patients (81% male, median (IQR) age 72 (22) years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Sixteen patients received 1 g/8 h and 15 2 g/8 h by CI (8 h infusion). Plasma and ELF meropenem concentrations were modeled using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of attaining (PTA) a free ELF concentration of 50% of time above MIC (50% fT>MIC), which results in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance in experimental models of pneumonia. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of meropenem AUC(0C24 h) in the plasma and ELF was 287.6 (190.2) and 84.1 (78.8) mg h/L in the 1 g/8 h group vs 448.1 (231.8) and 163.0 (201.8) mg h/L in the 2 g/8 h group, respectively. The penetration ratio was approximately 30% and was comparable between the dosage groups. In the Monte Carlo simulations, only the highest approved dose of meropenem of 2 g/8 h by CI allowed to achieve an optimal PTA for all isolates with a MIC < 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the dose of meropenem administered by CI achieved a higher exposure in the plasma and ELF. The use of the highest licensed dose of 6 g/day may be necessary to achieve an optimal coverage in ELF for all susceptible isolates (MIC  2 mg/L) in patients with conserved renal function. An alternative therapy should be considered when the presence of microorganisms with a MIC greater than 2 mg/L is suspected.

The threat of a public health emergency catalyzed underlying xenophobic sentiments, manifesting them into racial discrimination of various degrees. With most discriminatory acts reported in liberal societies, this article investigates whether an economy more open to trade and migration can be more susceptible to xenophobia. Using our first-hand survey data of 1767 Chinese respondents residing overseas from 65 different countries during February of 2020, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of openness to trade and migration of their residence country on the likelihood of them receiving discriminatory behaviors during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that greater openness to trade increases the likelihood of reported xenophobic behaviors, while openness to migration decreases it. On the other hand, stronger trade or immigration relationships with China are associated with less reported discrimination. And these effects primarily influence discriminatory behavior in interpersonal spaces, rather than through media outlets. Our findings highlight nuances of the effect of trade relations on the culture of a society.","output":"Openness and COVID-19 induced xenophobia: The roles of trade and migration in sustainable development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No Abstract Available.","output":"Are Medicinal Plants an Alternative Strategy to Combat COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The U.S. health care system faces increasing pressures for reform.

Researchers across the world are collaborating in a quest for remedies to combat this deadly virus. It has recently been demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein (SGP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the mediator by which the virus enters host cells. MAIN METHODS: Our group comprehensibly analyzed the SGP of SARS-CoV-2 through multiple sequence analysis and a phylogenetic analysis. We predicted the strongest immunogenic epitopes of the SGP for both B cells and T cells. KEY FINDINGS: We focused on predicting peptides that would bind major histocompatibility complex class I. Two optimal epitopes were identified, WTAGAAAYY and GAAAYYVGY. They interact with the HLA-B*15:01 allele, which was further validated by molecular docking simulation. This study also found that the selected epitopes are able to be recognized in a large percentage of the world's population. Furthermore, we predicted CD4(+) T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes.

A number of port cities of Ukraine, such as Odessa, Izmail, Kherson, and Mykolaiv, significantly contribute to the pollution of the sea water areas with IAS. Invasive alien species that are present in sea water are supplied together with the latter into ballast tanks (to maintain balance, list, and stability of ships) and end up in the sea even after passing through the ballast cleaning system, thereby securing themselves in certain water areas and ceasing to play the sanitary role; on the contrary, they become pests, i.e., a threat to the World Ocean.

The etiology is multifactorial with the contribution of genetic, immune, microbial, and environmental risk factors with a substantial involvement of host:microbial cross-talk in the lumen. Whether and how antiviral responses contribute to IBD pathogenesis is under intense investigation. Here, we identified two unrelated patients diagnosed with infantile-onset IBD with rare variants in type III Interferons (IFNs), also known as interferon lambdas, a group of IFNs that play key roles in the protection against enteric viruses. The first patient was found to have homozygous variants in both IFNL2 and IFNL3, the genes encoding, IFN lambda-2 and IFN lambda-3, respectively. The second patient was found to have inherited compound heterozygous variants in IFNL3, with one of the two alleles bearing the same variant as the first patient. Functional analyses revealed that the proteins coded for by these variant IFN-lambda genes exhibited defects in the induction of IFN signaling. More detailed assessment of the variants identified in Patient 1 demonstrated defects in their ability to bind to IFN lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1), as well as their ability to induce heterodimerization of IFNLR1 and IL10RB, which together compromise the functional receptor for IFN lambda (IFNLR). These patient-encoded IFN lambda variants also exhibit defects in the ability to induce robust downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in patient-derived intestinal organoids. All in all, we demonstrate that infantile-onset IBD is associated with variants in IFN lambdas and defective induction of downstream IFN signaling.","output":"Variants in Interferon Lambda are Associated with Infantile-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, Cambodia uses performance-based financing (PBF) and a national quality enhancement monitoring system as key components of its strategy to achieve universal health coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.

In this study, the time series of the number of infections and deaths were analyzed to study the behavior of the pandemic over time. The cumulative curve of the phenomenon was analyzed to show the extent of the pandemic's decline or spread. On the other hand, the time curve of the number of cases of the pandemic was fitted based on a set of mathematical and statistical models, which were divided into three sections [nonlinear growth model, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model, regression model] to attain the best possible fitting of the relationship curve. The results show that the Weibull model and Polynomial model at (n = 4) are the best models for fitting the relationship at short run and the SEIR model gives better relationship fitting at long run.

However, concerns about the risk of expedited science have been raised. We aimed at reviewing and categorizing COVID-19-related medical research and to critically appraise peer-reviewed original articles. METHODS: The data sources were Pubmed, Cochrane COVID-19 register study, arXiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv, from 01/11/2019 to 01/05/2020. Peer-reviewed and preprints publications related to COVID-19 were included, written in English or Chinese. No limitations were placed on study design. Reviewers screened and categorized studies according to i) publication type, ii) country of publication, and iii) topics covered. Original articles were critically appraised using validated quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Among the 11,452 publications identified, 10,516 met the inclusion criteria, among which 7468 (71.0%) were peer-reviewed articles. Among these, 4190 publications (56.1%) did not include any data or analytics (comprising expert opinion pieces). Overall, the most represented topics were infectious disease (n = 2326, 22.1%), epidemiology (n = 1802, 17.1%), and global health (n = 1602, 15.2%). The top five publishing countries were China (25.8%), United States (22.3%), United Kingdom (8.8%), Italy (8.1%) and India (3.4%). The dynamic of publication showed that the exponential growth of COVID-19 peer-reviewed articles was mainly driven by publications without original data (mean 261.5 articles  51.1 per week) as compared with original articles (mean of 69.3  22.3 articles per week). Original articles including patient data accounted for 713 (9.5%) of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 576 original articles (80.8%) showed intermediate to high risk of bias. Last, except for simulation studies that mainly used large-scale open data, the median number of patients enrolled was of 102 (IQR = 37C337). CONCLUSIONS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of research is composed by publications without original data. Peer-reviewed original articles with data showed a high risk of bias and included a limited number of patients. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to strike a balance between the velocity and quality of research, and to cautiously consider medical information and clinical applicability in a pressing, pandemic context.

This provides an objective means of describing observed waves in time series. ResultsThe output of the algorithm as applied to epidemiological time series related to COVID-19 corresponds to visual intuition and expert opinion. Inspecting the results of individual countries shows how consecutive observed waves can differ greatly with respect to the case fatality ratio. Furthermore, in large countries, a more detailed analysis shows that consecutive observed waves have different geographical ranges. We also show how waves can be modulated by government interventions and find that early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions correlates with a reduced number of observed waves and reduced mortality burden in those waves.

Increasing AMR and a dry pipeline of novel antimicrobial drugs have put AMR in the international spotlight. One strategy to combat AMR is to reduce antimicrobial drug consumption. Governments around the world have been experimenting with different policy interventions, such as regulating where antimicrobials can be sold, restricting the use of last-resort antimicrobials, funding AMR stewardship programs, and launching public awareness campaigns. To inform future action, governments should have access to synthesized data on the effectiveness of large-scale AMR interventions. This planned systematic review will (1) identify and describe previously evaluated government policy interventions to reduce human antimicrobial use and (2) estimate the effectiveness of these different strategies. METHODS An electronic search strategy has been developed in consultation with two research librarians. Seven databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PAIS Index, Web of Science, and PubMed excluding MEDLINE) will be searched, and additional studies will be identified using several gray literature search strategies. To be included, a study must (1) clearly describe the government policy and (2) use a rigorous design to quantitatively measure the impact of the policy on human antibiotic use. The intervention of interest is any policy intervention enacted by a government or government agency in any country to change human antimicrobial use. Two independent reviewers will screen for eligibility using criteria defined a priori. Data will be extracted with Covidence software using a customized extraction form. If sufficient data exists, a meta-analysis by intervention type will be conducted as part of the effectiveness review. However, if there are too few studies or if the interventions are too heterogeneous, data will be tabulated and a narrative synthesis strategy will be used. DISCUSSION This evidence synthesis is intended for use by policymakers, public health practitioners, and researchers to inform future government policies aiming to address antimicrobial resistance. This review will also identify gaps in the evidence about the effectiveness of different policy interventions to inform future research priorities.

As the virus is transmitted through close contact and droplets, frontline HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients are at risk of the infection. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and preventive practices towards Covid-19 among health care providers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno Bedele zones, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: : An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 330 health workers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno-Bedelle Zones, Southwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered onto Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of preventive practices towards Covid-19. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05. Result: Greater part (93.3%) of the respondent demonstrated good knowledge towards COVID-19 and the mean (SD) knowledge score was 9.0 4 1.06. Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of the study participants had good infection prevention practices.

Data analysis assists such organisations in providing information that could help in decision-making processes. For this purpose, both national and regional health authorities provided health data for further processing and analysis. Shared data must comply with existing data protection and privacy regulations. Therefore, a robust de-identification procedure must be used, and a re-identification risk analysis should also be performed. De-identified data embodies state-of-the-art approaches in Data Protection by Design and Default because it requires the protection of direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). This article highlights the importance of assessing re-identification risk before data disclosure by analysing a data set of individuals infected by Covid-19 that was made available for research purposes. We stress that it is highly important to make this data available for research purposes and that this process should be based on the state of the art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. Our main goal is to consider different re-identification risk analysis scenarios since the information on the intruder side is unknown. Our conclusions show that there is a risk of identity disclosure for all of the studied scenarios. For one, in particular, we proceed to an example of a re-identification attack.

While most research has been performed on grasslands, the effect of large managed ungulates on forest ecosystems has largely been neglected. Compared to a baseline seminatural state, we investigated how long-term cattle grazing of birch forest patches affected the abiotic state and the ecological community (microbes and invertebrates) of the soil subsystem. Grazing strongly modified the soil abiotic environment by increasing phosphorus content, pH, and bulk density, while reducing the C:N ratio. The reduced C:N ratio was strongly associated with a lower microbial biomass, mainly caused by a reduction of fungal biomass. This was linked to a decrease in fungivorous nematode abundance and the nematode channel index, indicating a relative uplift in the importance of the bacterial energy-channel in the nematode assemblages. Cattle grazing highly modified invertebrate community composition producing distinct assemblages from the seminatural situation. Richness and abundance of microarthropods was consistently reduced by grazing (excepting collembolan richness) and grazing-associated changes in soil pH, Olsen P, and reduced soil pore volume (bulk density) limiting niche space and refuge from physical disturbance. Anecic earthworm species predominated in grazed patches, but were absent from ungrazed forest, and may benefit from manure inputs, while their deep vertical burrowing behavior protects them from physical disturbance. Perturbation of birch forest habitat by long-term ungulate grazing profoundly modified soil biodiversity, either directly through increased physical disturbance and manure input or indirectly by modifying soil abiotic conditions. Comparative analyses revealed the ecosystem engineering potential of large ungulate grazers in forest systems through major shifts in the composition and structure of microbial and invertebrate assemblages, including the potential for reduced energy flow through the fungal decomposition pathway.

However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and haemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped nor imputed. Using genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase of mortality among COVID-19 patients. In summary, our ROH-DICE method, by calling out large ROH diplotypes in a large outbred population, enables further population genetics into the demographic history of large populations.

We find that air pollution is positively correlated with adverse outcomes of the pandemic, with lockdown being strongly significant and more effective in reducing deceases in more polluted areas. Results are robust to different methods including cross-section, pooled and fixed-effect panel regressions (controlling for spatial correlation), instrumental variable regressions, and difference-in-differences estimates of lockdown decisions through predicted counterfactual trends. They are consistent with the consolidated body of literature in previous medical studies suggesting that poor quality of air creates chronic exposure to adverse outcomes from respiratory diseases.

Using a prototype analysis (a bottom-up approach collecting laypeople's views on hope), the present research defines hope and provides insights into its associations with other related constructs. Study 1 identified a list of features of hope derived from characteristics generated by laypeople in the Netherlands and the United States when asked to think about hope. Study 2 determined the centrality of each of these features of hope, where the most frequently mentioned features were classified as \\"central features,\\" whereas the less frequently as \\"peripheral features.\\" Studies 3-5 then tested the validity of this classification and showed that central features (compared with peripheral ones) were more often recalled and recognized (Study 3), were classified as a feature of hope more quickly (Study 4), and were more representative in autobiographical situations involving hope (Study 5). Our findings are in part consistent with the definitions of hope reported in previous literature, and suggest in addition that some features deserve more attention than before. Based on our findings and previous literature, we propose the following core elements of hope: belief, positive, future, desire, and possibility. Accordingly, we propose the working definition that hope is a belief that a positive future outcome is possible combined with a desire for that outcome. As our research provides a more nuanced understanding of hope and its associations with other related constructs, we hope the current findings will contribute to future research on this important topic.

METHODS Data were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. The study examined data from the period 1999 to 2007. A total of 652 subjects were included in the final analysis, and they were categorized as normally employed or unemployed depending on their employment status in 1999. Frailty was defined using the Fried criteria. Multiple confounding factors were adjusted in a multilevel analysis. RESULTS The average age of the participants in 1999 was 59.0 years. A total of 491 participants were normally employed, and 161 participants were unemployed. After adjustment for gender, age, level of education, income, marital status, and number of chronic diseases, late-career unemployment was associated with increased frailty [odds ratio (OR) = 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-2.59].

OBJECTIVES: To investigate rater reliability of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure or SCIM III among rehabilitation professionals, along with the concurrent validity of the tool as compared to standard measures covering wheelchair users (WU) and ambulatory (AM) individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: A tertiary rehabilitation center and communities. METHODS: Eighty-two participants with SCI (39 WU and 43 AM individuals) were assessed using SCIM III items. The data of first 30 participants were video recorded for rater reliability assessments by seven rehabilitation professionals, including nurses, occupational therapists, and physical therapists (one novice and one experienced rater for each professional). All participants were also assessed using standard measures to verify concurrent validity of SCIM III by an experienced rater. RESULTS: The SCIM III showed excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability among rehabilitation professionals when analyzed for overall items (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) >0.90) and separately for each subscale (kappa values >0.80). The total SCIM III of WU and the mobility scores of AM participants showed significant correlation with standard measures for muscle strength, limit of stability, balance control, functional endurance, and walking ability (r(s) = 0.343C0.779; p < 0.05).

However, nature, density and therapeutic impact of FcRIIIA(+) (CD16) effector cells in tumor remain poorly documented. Moreover, the inhibition of cetuximab-mediated ADCC induced by NK cells by the engagement of the new inhibitory CD94-NKG2A immune checkpoint has only been demonstrated in vitro. This multicentric study aimed to determine, on paired primary and metastatic tissue samples from a cohort of mCRC patients treated with cetuximab: 1) the nature and density of FcRIIIA(+) (CD16) immune cells, 2) the expression profile of HLA-E/2m by tumor cells as well as the density of CD94(+) immune cells and 3) their impact on both objective response to cetuximab and survival. We demonstrated that FcRIIIA(+) (CD16) intraepithelial immune cells mainly correspond to tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), and their high density in metastases was significantly associated with a better response to cetuximab, independently of the expression of the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory immune checkpoint. However, HLA-E/2m, preferentially overexpressed in metastases compared with primary tumors and associated with CD94(+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), was associated with a poor overall survival. Altogether, these results strongly support the use of bispecific antibodies directed against both EGFR and FcRIIIA (CD16) in mCRC patients, to boost cetuximab-mediated ADCC in RAS wild-type mCRC patients. The preferential overexpression of HLA-E/2m in metastases, associated with CD94(+) TILs and responsible for a poor prognosis, provides convincing arguments to inhibit this new immune checkpoint with monalizumab, a humanized anti-NKG2A antibody, in combination with anti- FcRIIIA/EGFR bispecific antibodies as a promising therapeutic perspective in RAS wild-type mCRC patients.","output":"High-Density of FcRIIIA(+) (CD16(+)) Tumor-Associated Neutrophils in Metastases Improves the Therapeutic Response of Cetuximab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients, Independently of the HLA-E/CD94-NKG2A Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteasomal activity is compromised in diabetic hearts that contributes to proteotoxic stresses and cardiac dysfunction.

Mice received a single intravenous injection of the cardiotrophic adeno-associated virus serotype 9 to overexpress OSTN in the heart and then were exposed to intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg) for consecutive 5 days to generate diabetic models. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and stimulated with high glucose to verify the role of OSTN in vitro. OSTN expression was reduced by protein kinase B/forkhead box O1 dephosphorylation in diabetic hearts, while its overexpression significantly attenuated cardiac injury and dysfunction in mice with STZ treatment. Besides, OSTN incubation prevented, whereas OSTN silence aggravated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and injury upon hyperglycemic stimulation in vitro. Mechanistically, OSTN treatment restored protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent proteasomal function, and PKG or proteasome inhibition abrogated the protective effects of OSTN in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, OSTN replenishment was sufficient to prevent the progression of pre-established DCM and had synergistic cardioprotection with sildenafil.

Therefore, we aimed to report the characteristics of infected health-care workers and investigate the relationship between BCG vaccine and tuberculosis history with COVID-19 mortality in infected health-care worker population. Method: This study was conducted in three hospitals to assess the clinical presentations, disease severity and correlation with BCG vaccine and tuberculous history in COVID-19 positive health-care workers by an online questionnaire platform. The relationship between characteristics and tuberculosis history were investigated according to hospitalization status of the patients. Result: Total of 465 infected healthcare workers included in the study. The rate of history of direct care and contact to tuberculosis patient, presence of previous tuberculosis treatment and BCG scar, presence of radiological infiltrations was significantly higher in hospitalized healthcare workers. The ratio of direct care and direct contact to the patient with tuberculosis, and presence of family history of tuberculosis were statistically significantly higher in patients with radiological infiltrations. Conclusion: Although COVID-19 risk and incidence are higher among healthcare workers compared to the normal population due to higher virus load, we think that the lower mortality rate seen in infected healthcare workers results from healthcare workers' frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of BCG vaccine, despite the higher hospitalization rate and radiological infiltrations due to over-triggered immune system.","output":"The Characteristics of Health Care Workers with COVID-19 and Relationship Between COVID-19 Mortality and BCG/Tuberculosis History: a multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we propose a regime separation for the analysis of Covid19 on Romania combined with mathematical models of SIR and SIRD.

To actually deal with this we introduce a simple modification of the SIR model to account for the deceased separately. This in turn will be our base for fitting the parameters. The estimation of the parameters is done in two steps. The first one consists in training a neural network based on SIR models to detect the regime changes.

The ability of Azolla to grow at such rapid rates allows for the opportunity of utilizing it as a method to sequester a significant amount of atmospheric CO(2) in the form of biomass, which can be locked away to completely remove the carbon from the active carbon cycle, or which can be used in various applications such as animal feeds, biofertilizers, and biofuel production, which in turn will contribute to reduction in the fossil CO(2) emissions. In this desktop study, the potential use of Azolla for mitigating the annual increase in the atmospheric CO(2) levels was addressed, which were estimated at 18.9 billion tons of CO(2) per year. A theoretical setup of 1-ha ponds was assessed to estimate the total Azolla growing area required for counterbalancing the annual atmospheric CO(2) increase. Each 1-ha pond was found capable of capturing 21,266 kg of CO(2) (C) per year. The calculated required total area to mitigate the total annual increase was estimated to be 1,018,023 km(2) (equivalent to around a fifth of the Amazon forest area).

Molecular imaging could provide functional as well as anatomical information for visualizing various inflammatory diseases. Advancements in imaging tracers for inflammation would improve the accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring, thus facilitating patient care. The positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer, 68Ga-labeled antagonist peptide Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp (WRWWWW, WRW4), targets formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), which is in turn widely distributed in a variety of tissues and is associated with many inflammatory diseases. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the potential of 68Ga-WRW4 for detecting and monitoring inflammatory lesions in mice. We established an inflammation mouse model by the intramuscular injection of turpentine oil into the left thigh. WRW4 was labeled with 68Ga with an overall radiochemical yield >90% and radiochemical purity >99%. 68Ga-WRW4 uptake in inflamed muscle peaked on day 2 (1.14  0.01 percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g)) and the uptake ratio of inflammatory/normal muscle also reached a maximum (12.36  2.35). Strong PET signals were detected in the left thigh at 60 min after the injection of 68Ga-WRW4 in experimental mice, but weak or no signals were detected in mice in the blocking and control groups. 68Ga-WRW4 uptake was in agreement with the dynamics of immune cell infiltration during the inflammatory reaction. These results suggest that 68Ga-WRW4 is a promising PET tracer suitable for the noninvasive detection of FPR2 expression and for monitoring inflammatory activity in inflammation-bearing mice.","output":"68Ga-WRWWWW Is a Potential Positron Emission Tomography Probe for Imaging Inflammatory Diseases by Targeting Formyl Peptide Receptor 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia have been widely-documented, but most studies have relied on carer reports and few have compared responses to information collected before the pandemic. OBJECTIVE We aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia and compare responses with pre-pandemic data. METHODS During the second wave of the pandemic, we conducted structured telephone interviews with 173 people with dementia and 242 carers acting as informants, all of whom had previously participated in the IDEAL cohort. Where possible, we benchmarked responses against pre-pandemic data. RESULTS Significant perceived negative impacts were identified in cognitive and functional skills and ability to engage in self-care and manage everyday activities, along with increased levels of loneliness and discontinuity in sense of self and a decline in perceived capability to 'live well'. Compared to pre-pandemic data, there were lower levels of pain, depression, and anxiety, higher levels of optimism, and better satisfaction with family support. There was little impact on physical health, mood, social connections and relationships, or perceptions of neighborhood characteristics. CONCLUSION Efforts to mitigate negative impacts of pandemic-related restrictions and restore quality of life could focus on reablement to address the effects on participation in everyday activities, creating opportunities for social contact to reduce loneliness, and personalized planning to reconnect people with their pre-COVID selves. Such efforts may build on the resilience demonstrated by people with dementia and carers in coping with the pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on 'Living Well' with Mild-to-Moderate Dementia in the Community: Findings from the IDEAL Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) are associated with a high risk of mortality.

We collected peripheral blood samples at admission and the time point of exacerbation to compare differences in the phenotypes and functions of major populations of immune cells between the groups. RESULTS: On admission, compared to patients with poor prognoses, those with good prognoses had significantly higher counts of monocytes (p < 0.05), macrophages (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD45RO(+)CXCR3(+) subsets (p < 0.05), higher frequency of CD14(+)CD11C(+)HLA\\\\DR(+) subset of dendritic cells (DCs) (p < 0.05), and a lower count of neutrophils (p < 0.05). At the time point of exacerbation, the proportions of na?ve CD4(+) T cells (p < 0.05), Tregs, and Th2 cells in the poor prognosis group were relatively higher than those in the good prognosis group, and CD4(+) memory T cells were relatively lower (p < 0.05).

The effectivity of vitamin D as a therapeutic intervention in critical illness remains less defined. The current study analyzed clinical and immunologic effects of vitamin D levels in patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10C15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D(3) via enteral feeding. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10C15 days. Clinical parameters did not differ between patients with sufficient or deficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only circulating plasmablasts were higher in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 30 ng/ml (p = 0.029). Patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 pg/ml required longer mechanical ventilation (p = 0.045) and had a worse acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of COVID-19 ARDS patients had vitamin D deficiency. 25-hydroxyvitamin D status was not related to changes in clinical course, whereas low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and a worse APACHE II score.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency in critically ill COVID-19 ARDS patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last month of 2019, a new Coronavirus from China started to spread all around the world causing a pandemic emergency still ongoing.

A fundamental role has been played by tests used to diagnose COVID-19 and to isolate infected asymptomatic subjects, with a view to the viral evolution and the emerging variants. However, the need for the urgent set-up of new methods for assessing both new and past infections has resulted in a large number of methods, not always comparable with each other, in terms of laboratory techniques, viral antigens used for detection, and class of antibodies detected.

Even the field of computer-aided drug design (CADD) is not an exception. The situation is ambivalent. On one hand, more scientists are becoming aware of the benefits of learning from available data and are beginning to derive predictive models before designing experiments. However, on the other hand, easy accessibility of in silico tools comes at the risk of using them as black boxes without sufficient expert knowledge, leading to widespread misconceptions and problems. For example, results of computations may be taken at face value as nothing but the truth and data visualization may be used only to generate pretty and colorful pictures. Computational experts might come to the rescue and help to re-direct such efforts, for example, by guiding interested novices to conduct meaningful data analysis, make scientifically sound predictions, and communicate the findings in a rigorous manner. However, this is not always ensured. This contribution aims to encourage investigators entering the CADD arena to obtain adequate computational training, communicate or collaborate with experts, and become aware of the fundamentals of computational methods and their given limitations, beyond the hype.

Intelligence, personality traits, and family SES accounted together for up to 23.5% (M = 9.7%) of the variance in emerging adulthood outcomes. Personality traits, including the Big Five, grit, curiosity, and ambition, were the most consistent and strongest predictors across outcomes, although intelligence was a better predictor of educational attainment. Intelligence, but not personality, accounted for a significant proportion of the associations between family SES with educational attainment, degree classification, behavior problems, aggression, and volunteering (16.4%-29.1%). Finally, intelligence, ambition, conscientiousness, curiosity, and openness were all stronger predictors of educational attainment at low compared to high SES levels. These significant interactions suggest that these traits may help compensate for family background disadvantage, although the corresponding effect sizes were small (R2 0.4%-3%).

The survey used stratified random probability sampling of the U.S. adult population (N = 1222). Outcome measures were respective single items assessing COVID-19 skepticism and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. Exposure variables included political, religious, and sociodemographic indicators, and moderators assessed personal history of COVID-19 and losing a relative or close friend to COVID-19. RESULTS: Skepticism and vaccine hesitancy were strongly associated with conservative and Republican political preference and conservative religious beliefs, and less so with socioeconomic status. Personal experience with COVID-19 did not mitigate the effect of politics on skepticism and barely reduced the odds for hesitancy. Results confirm that attitudes toward COVID-19 are politically and religiously conditioned, and are especially a product of conservative political preference. CONCLUSION: Skepticism about COVID-19 and hesitancy regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are highest among the political and religious right. Efforts to increase immunization through public education may be inadequate; resistance appears ideological. Other solutions may need to be considered, which risk widespread pushback both politically and religiously motivated.","output":"Determinants of COVID-19 skepticism and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy: findings from a national population survey of U.S. adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events such as the global pandemic of COVID-19 have challenged neuropsychologists to scale up their capacity to conduct portions of their assessment remotely While more complex patients will likely continue to require on-site, office-based interaction and assessment, the current emergency-based expansion of online and telehealth evaluation practices may ultimately lay the groundwork for more routine, online assessment of patients with less complex presentations in the future To this end, the current study evaluated a pre-appointment, online methodology for differentiating referred pediatric patients based upon the scope and severity of their caregiver-reported adaptive, academic, attentional, behavioral, and emotional impairment Prior to on-site assessment, parents/caregivers of 2197 children (Mean age = 10 0y, range = 4-19y, 62% male) completed an online developmental history form screening for symptoms of adaptive, attentional, learning, affective, and behavioral impairment;71% of those children eventually underwent assessment Using latent class analysis, the data supported a reproducible 4-class model consisting of groups of children at increased risk for: 1) severe multi-domain dysfunction;the \\"High Complexity\\" group, 30%, 2) behavioral-affective (but not academic) dysregulation;the \\"Behavioral Focus\\" group, 13%, 3) academic (but not behavioral-affective) problems;the \\"Academic and Inattention\\" group, 37%, and 4) patients with minimal clinical complexity;the \\"Low Complexity\\" group, 20% Comparison of pre-visit classification with day-of-assessment standardized test scores supported the validity of patient subtypes Moving forward, pre-appointment clarification of patient complexity may support efficient patient triage with regard to assessment modality (e g , on-site or online) and length of appointment (e g , comprehensive or targeted)","output":"Pre-appointment online assessment of patient complexity: Towards a personalized model of neuropsychological assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To depict the clinical characters and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

The underlying mechanisms of PEDV infection and the reasons why newborn piglets are more susceptible than older pigs remain incompletely understood. Iron deficiency is common in newborn piglets. Here we found that high levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) distributed in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi of newborns, and intracellular iron levels influence the susceptibility of newborn piglets to PEDV. We show that iron deficiency induced by deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelating agent) promotes PEDV infection while iron accumulation induced by ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, an iron supplement) impairs PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo. Besides, PEDV infection was inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or decreasing TfR1 expression. Additionally, PEDV infection was increased in PEDV-resistant Caco-2 and HEK 293T cells over-expressed porcine TfR1. Mechanistically, the PEDV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1 during PEDV entry, promotes TfR1 re-localization and clustering, then activates TfR1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src kinase, and heightens the internalization of TfR1, thereby promoting PEDV entry. Taken together, these data suggest that the higher expression of TfR1 in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi caused by iron deficiency, accounts for newborn piglets being acutely susceptible to PEDV.","output":"Transferrin receptor 1 levels at the cell surface influence the susceptibility of newborn piglets to PEDV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe, novel virus that has spread globally. The implementation of a combination of public health interventions is required to reduce viral spread and avoid overwhelming acute care systems. Once available, an effective vaccination will further mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, decision makers will initially need to prioritise access to limited vaccine stockpiles as these will be insufficient to vaccine the whole population. The aim of this study is to identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies defined by age and risk target groups, coverage, effectiveness, and cost of vaccine, within a dynamic context where other public health responses and population behaviour change. In this study we use an epidemiological model of COVID-19 that has been enhanced to produce expected costs and Quality Adjusted Life Year results as well as total cases, hospitalisations, deaths, and net monetary benefit. We use the model to simulate hypothetical scenarios where vaccine is allocated beginning on October 15, 2020 with vaccine assumptions ranging from moderately optimistic to worst-case scenario. Net monetary benefit is used as the objective for optimisation. In a scenario with a sterilizing vaccine that is 80% effective, a stockpile sufficient for 40% population coverage, and prioritisation of those over the age of 60 at high risk of poor outcomes, active cases are reduced by 29.2% and net monetary benefit increased by $297 million dollars, relative to an identical scenario with no vaccine. The relative impact of prioritisation strategies varies greatly depending on concurrent public health interventions, for example, polices such as school closures and senior contact reductions have similar impacts on incremental net monetary benefit when there is no prioritisation given to any age or risk group (147 vs. 120 million, respectively), but when older and high risk groups are given priority, the benefit of school closures is much larger than reducing contacts for seniors (iNB 122 vs. 79 million, respectively). Results demonstrated that rank ordering of different prioritisation options varied greatly by prioritisation criteria, with different vaccine effectiveness and coverage, and by concurrently implemented policies. The results of this paper have three key policy implications: (i) that optimal vaccine allocation will depend on the public health policies, and human behaviours in place at the time of allocation; (ii) the outcomes of vaccine allocation policies can be greatly supported with interventions targeting contact reduction in critical sub-populations; and (iii) the identification of the optimal strategy depends on which outcomes are prioritised.","output":"A Net Benefit Approach for the Optimal Allocation of a COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Materials and methods: In total, 936 participants were asked every day. Short publications were published every day based on the scientific evidence (FAO, WHO, AECOSAN) through social media such as Instagram, accompanied by a questionnaire of 11 questions (yes/no) where it was intended to assess the evolution of daily consumption. Results and Discussion: The diffusion through social media has allowed to have a greater reach of the population. We observed that mood throughout confinement generally improves. There are certain eating habits from the MD that are well established in the daily diet of our population, such as the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy products, and eggs. It seems that enjoying good health is a growing concern in pandemic situations, which is why inappropriate behaviours such as snacking between meals or the consumption of processed foods such as snacks, industrial pastries, soft drinks, and sweets are avoided, increasing the amount of healthy food such as meat and fish.

In addition to examining the first RT-PCR test of repeat-tested individuals, we also used high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 as the reference standard for calculating the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: All 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2% women) admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1% women) was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. The sensitivity (95% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases (repeat-tested patients) was 85.7% (81.5C89.1%) inpatients; 95.5% (92.2C97.5%) outpatients, 89.9% (88.2C92.1%) all.

METHODS: Epidemiological information including date of symptom onset, date of positive-sample detection and travel and contact history for individual cases from this flight were collected. Whole genome sequencing was performed, and sequences were classified based on the dynamic Pango nomenclature system. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis compared sequences from this flight alongside other cases imported from India to Hong Kong on 26 flights between June 2020 and April 2021, as well as sequences from India or associated with India-related travel from February to April 2021 and 1217 reference sequences. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified six lineages of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to two variants of concern (Alpha and Delta) and one variant of public health interest (Kappa) involved in this outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed at least three independent sub-lineages of Alpha with limited onward transmission, a superspreading event comprising 37 cases of Kappa and transmission of Delta to only one passenger. Additional analysis of another 26 flights from India to Hong Kong confirmed widespread circulation of all three variants in India since early March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The broad spectrum of disease severity and long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 pose a challenge for surveillance and control. As illustrated by this particular outbreak, opportunistic infections of SARS-CoV-2 can occur irrespective of variant lineage, and requiring a nucleic acid test within 72 hours of departure may be insufficient to prevent importation or in-flight transmission.","output":"Air travel-related outbreak of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for society The effects on organizations have been drastic and such tough times have demanded new organizational solutions as well as strong and new forms of organizational leadership Leadership scholars have accelerated their research efforts in the quest to identify what is needed to lead in these uncertain times In this paper, we adopt a bibliometric review to unravel the emerging trends in leadership research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in doing so, identify commonalities and divergences in these themes with respect to leadership approaches and assess potential avenues for future research The findings reveal that research on the topic has emerged along six main clusters: (1) leadership and employee health during pandemic times, (2) public leadership, (3) leadership in health care, (4) leadership and diversity, (5) educational leadership, and (6) leadership and persuasive communication The findings reveal that across these clusters, the pandemic has sparked research on leadership approaches that deal with change and uncertainty as well as those that are less hierarchical and person centered in nature We also notice a novel attention to context Rather than ?new kids on the block,? these trends are largely continuations of established leadership theories and approaches that see their particular importance increase in this unprecedented situation Finally, we outline some distinct avenues for further research with regard to leadership in COVID-19 times","output":"New Kids on the Block?

Explanatory factors may include weather, indoor crowding, seasonal respiratory infections and migration. Using enhanced citywide TB surveillance data collected over nine years in Blantyre, Malawi, we set out to investigate how weather and seasonality affect temporal trends in TB case notification rates (CNRs) across different demographic groups. We used data from prospective enhanced surveillance between April 2011 and December 2018, which systematically collected age, HIV status, sex and case notification dates for all registering TB cases in Blantyre. We retrieved temperature and rainfall data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day weather station database. We calculated weekly trends in TB CNRs, rainfall and temperature, and calculated 10-week moving averages. To investigate the associations between rainfall, temperature and TB CNRs, we fitted generalized linear models using a distributed lag nonlinear framework. The estimated Blantyre population increased from 1,068,151 in April 2011 to 1,264,304 in December 2018, with 15,908 TB cases recorded. Overall annual TB CNRs declined from 222 to 145 per 100,000 between 2012 and 2018, with the largest declines seen in HIV-positive people and adults aged over 20 years old. TB CNRs peaks occurred with increasing temperature in September and October before the onset of increased rainfall, and later in the rainy season during January-March, after sustained rainfall. When lag between a change in weather and TB case notifications was accounted for, higher average rainfall was associated with an equivalent six weeks of relatively lower TB notification rates, whereas there were no changes in TB CNR associated with change in average temperatures. TB CNRs in Blantyre have a seasonal pattern of two cyclical peaks per year, coinciding with the start and end of the rainy season. These trends may be explained by increased transmission at certain times of the year, by limited healthcare access, by patterns of seasonal respiratory infections precipitating cough and care-seeking, or by migratory patterns related to planting and harvesting during the rainy season.","output":"Tuberculosis case notifications in Malawi have strong seasonal and weather-related trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As only few studies have analyzed viral kinetics between the incubation and symptomatic periods of COVID-19 patients, we investigated the viral kinetics and compared viral loads between patients with mild and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We determined the viral kinetics of 10 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at Chosun University Hospital. Six patients were classified into the mild group and 4 into the severe group according to supplemental oxygen use during admission. Samples were collected via nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens. SARS-CoV-2 was detected using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chest radiograph scores during hospitalization were obtained RESULTS: Ct values of the upper respiratory tract specimens were low during the early stages after symptom onset but gradually increased over time in both groups. The severe group had lower Ct values than the mild group. The Ct values of the RdRP and E genes on day 6 after symptom onset were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group (p < 0.05). Three of 6 patients had positive results on RT-PCR even before symptom onset; 2 of them had the lowest Ct values. The chest radiograph scores were higher in the severe group than in the mild group, and the score in the severe group was the highest at approximately 3 weeks after symptom onset.

However, little is known about the functions of R2R3-MYB genes in Gynostemma pentaphyllum (G. pentaphyllum), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that is an excellent source of gypenosides (a class of triterpenoid saponins) and flavonoids. In this study, a systematic genome-wide analysis of the R2R3-MYB gene family was performed using the recently sequenced G. pentaphyllum genome. In total, 87 R2R3-GpMYB genes were identified and subsequently divided into 32 subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. The analysis was based on conserved exonCintron structures and motif compositions within the same subgroup. Collinearity analysis demonstrated that segmental duplication events were majorly responsible for the expansion of the R2R3-GpMYB gene family, and Ka/Ks analysis indicated that the majority of the duplicated R2R3-GpMYB genes underwent purifying selection. A combination of transcriptome analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that Gynostemma pentaphyllum myeloblastosis 81 (GpMYB81) along with genes encoding gypenoside and flavonol biosynthetic enzymes exhibited similar expression patterns in different tissues and responses to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Moreover, GpMYB81 could bind to the promoters of Gynostemma pentaphyllum farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 (GpFPS1) and Gynostemma pentaphyllum chalcone synthase (GpCHS), the key structural genes of gypenoside and flavonol biosynthesis, respectively, and activate their expression.

Animals were divided into four temperature groups (25, 20, 15 and 9 C) and treated for 4 weeks, with the 25 C group serving as a control. The total lipid content in the hepatopancreas as well as the triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid levels in the hemolymph were determined. Lipids stored in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased with decreasing temperature, with changes in the 9 C group most pronounced, indicating that lipids are the main energy source for crayfish at low temperatures. Furthermore, enzyme activity of lipase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and lipoprotein esterase, and gene expression analysis of fatty acid synthase gene, acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene and carnitine palmitoyltransferase gene showed that the digestion, synthesis and oxidation of lipids in the hepatopancreas were inhibited under low temperature stress, but expression of sphingolipid delta-4 desaturase (DEGS) was increased, indicating an increase in the demand for highly unsaturated fatty acids at low temperatures. Analysis of the expression of genes related to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway revealed that the adiponectin receptor gene was rapidly upregulated at low temperatures, which may in turn activate the expression of the downstream AMPK&#945; gene, thereby inhibiting lipid anabolism.","output":"Cold stress regulates lipid metabolism via AMPK signalling in Cherax quadricarinatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) is a pandemic with many countries employing massive public health responses. Little is known about the severity of illness in the pediatric population. This study sought to identify demographic information and severity of disease in pediatric patients with COVID-19. This was a retrospective study conducted on patients less than 18 years who were suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 and were reported to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (China CDC). Children were considered high risk and suspected if they had positive exposure to an endemic area or a confirmed case of COVID-19. High suspicion also included those with fever, respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, or fatigue, normal or low white blood cell count and increased C-reactive protein, or abnormal chest radiography, or those at lower risk for whom influenza or other respiratory illnesses were ruled out. Confirmed cases were defined as having a nasopharyngeal swab or blood sample positive via PCR or a genetic sampling of respiratory secretions or blood consistent with SARS-CoV-2. Once identified, patients were categorized by severity of disease using clinical features as well as laboratory and radiographic findings. Severity categories included asymptomatic (no symptoms but positive test), mild (mild respiratory symptoms and normal lung exam), moderate (pneumonia, fever, and cough but without hypoxemia or respiratory distress), severe (above symptoms as well as oxygen saturation less than 92% and respiratory distress), or critical disease (acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, or other life-threatening organ dysfunction). There were 2143 patients included who were suspected (65.9%) or confirmed (34.1%) to have COVID-19. Median age was 7 years (IQR 2-13) and the majority (56.6%) were male. The median time from onset of symptoms to presentation was 2 days (range 0-42). Nearly all were categorized as asymptomatic (4.4%), mild (50.9%), or moderate (38.8%) severity, leaving only 5.9% as severe or critical. Looking at breakdown by age, infants made up the highest proportion of severe or critical disease (32%) with preschool ages (1-5 years) next with 28.8%. Half (7) of the 13 critical patients were under 1 year old. No significant differences were seen between male or female patients. There was one death in the sample: a 14-year old boy. Limitations included lack of clinical characteristics, as only data from the Chinese CDC was used rather than electronic medical records from individual patients. Additionally the majority of cases were suspected, not confirmed, and some of the children remained hospitalized at the end of the study therefore severity of disease may not be accurate. The authors concluded that COVID-19 caused infection in all ages without obvious gender differences, however younger children appeared to have higher severity of disease. Comment: This is the largest cohort of pediatric COVID-19 patients to date. This study is based on the China CDC dataset and is limited to the variables that are reported to the CDC. We cannot assume children in the United States will be affected similarly. Overall, this dataset suggests that critical disease is rare in children with COVID-19. Emergency physicians should use caution with infants and young children, however, as they appear to be at highest risk of severe disease and may need closer observation in the emergency department or inpatient admission.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in China: Dong Y, Mo X, Hu Y, et al.

Development of a clinical prediction rule assessing the etiology of TD may help identify episodes of bacterial diarrhea and limit inappropriate antibiotic use. We aimed to identify predictors of bacterial diarrhea among clinical, demographic, and weather variables, as well as to develop and cross-validate a parsimonious predictive model. METHODS: We collected de-identified clinical data from 457 international travelers with acute diarrhea presenting to two healthcare centers in Nepal and Thailand. We used conventional microbiologic and multiplex molecular methods to identify diarrheal etiology from stool samples. We used random forest and logistic regression to determine predictors of bacterial diarrhea. RESULTS: We identified 195 cases of bacterial etiology, 63 viral, 125 mixed pathogens, 6 protozoal/parasite, and 68 cases without a detected pathogen. Random forest regression indicated that the strongest predictors of bacterial over viral or non-detected etiologies were average location-specific environmental temperature and RBC on stool microscopy. In 5-fold cross-validation, the parsimonious model with the highest discriminative performance had an AUC of 0.73 using 3 variables with calibration intercept -0.01 (SD 0.31) and slope 0.95 (SD 0.36).

Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the PLC at admission and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients and to establish a model for predicting death in COVID-19 hospitalized patients based on PLC. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found a non-linear relationship and threshold saturation effect between PLC and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients (infection point of PLC: 0.95  10(9)/L). Multiple regression analysis showed that when PLCs of COVID-19 patients were lower than 0.95  10(9)/L, the patients had a significantly higher mortality risk as compared to COVID-19 patient with PLCs > 0.95  10(9)/L (OR 7.27; 95% CI 1.10C48.25).

The article explores the difference between the linear economic model and the circular model by adopting sharing and the efficient joint use of materials to enhance and assess sustainable development. Based on a combination of theoretical and practical research, the article explores the dynamic system and development model of sharing a circular economy. The new concept of circular economy does not promote the overproduction of new goods but the rational use of already produced ones, which significantly reduces the amount of waste generated at all stages of the product life cycle. Population groups by different income groups for sharing services are analysed. An analysis of the price characteristics of popular sharing products was used from data from Internet portals.

We report on implementation adaptations and preliminary results. Background: Sociocultural and medical concerns are barriers to colonoscopy uptake in some populations. An additional barrier to CRC screening is system level capacity for colonoscopy that results in a back log of cases and long wait times. With Covid-19, the additional backlog in overdue CRC screening has underscored the need to expand FIT testing capacity to address screening needs and to pre-empt further racial/ethnic and SES disparities in CRC outcomes. This trial tests the unique and additive value of multiple EBIs for increasing CRC screening (primarily through FIT testing, but also colonoscopy when indicated) while evaluating the success of implementing these approaches. EBIs include the use of medical reminders, addressing the structural barriers (social determinants of health [SDOH]), and assistance from community health workers. Methods: Participants (3500), ages 45-75, were identified from a large FQHC in New Haven, CT and determined to be overdue for CRC screening. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four arms of the study: 1) Provider reminder (overdue for CRC screening) only;2) Provider Reminder + SDOH short message and one-size-fits all link to resources;3) Provider Reminder + SDOH short message and offer for individualized navigation (trained navigators from local community) to address SDOH and other barriers;4) Provider Reminder + offer to participate in a CRC educational program as phase 2 of the NCI's Screen to Save program (not an EBI). Preliminary data on uptake of CRC screening will be presented. Results: With input from stakeholders, we have: 1) lowered age eligibility from 50 to 45 to align with new guidelines;2) expanded the target population to 2 additional satellite clinics, more than doubling the proposed study enrollment;3) incorporated design changes in the patient reminders.

A traditional review of the literature was performed. Most cases of pharyngitis are viral and self-limited, although rarely viral pharyngitis due to EpsteinCBarr leads to airway obstruction. Bacterial pharyngitis is usually due to group A streptococcus (GAS), occurs primarily in children aged 5C15 years, and presents as sore throat in the absence of rhinitis, laryngitis or cough. Again, most cases are self-limited; antibiotics hasten recovery by only 1C2 days. Guidelines vary by country, but antibiotics are commonly recommended for proven GAS pharyngitis as they may prevent rare but severe complications, in particular rheumatic fever (RF). In this era of antimicrobial stewardship, it should be extremely rare that antibiotics are prescribed for presumed GAS pharyngitis until GAS has been detected. Even with proven GAS pharyngitis, it is controversial whether children at low risk for RF should routinely be prescribed antibiotics as the number needed to treat to prevent one case of RF is undoubtedly very large. When treatment is offered, the antibiotics of choice are penicillin or amoxicillin as they are narrow spectrum and resistance resulting in clinical failure is yet to be documented. A 10-day oral course is recommended as shorter courses appear to be less likely to clear carriage of GAS.

Here, we update current knowledge on the neurocircuitry of impulsive aggression by placing the neurocircuitry and its neurophysiological substrates into the top-down/bottom-up hypothesis of impulsive aggression. We then reverse the neurotranslational approach, which applies neuroscience to developing therapeutic drugs, and apply current understanding of potential mechanisms of anti-impulsive aggression agents to further clarify, at least heuristically and hypothetically, the dynamic biochemical components of the neurocircuitry of impulsive aggression. To do this, we searched the medical literature for studies attempting to clarify the neurobiological and neurochemical effects of the five most widely studied anti-impulsive aggressive agents, particularly as they pertain to the top-down/bottom-up hypothesis. Multiple different mechanisms are discussed, all of which fitting in the hypothesis by way of either promoting the \\"top-down\\" part (i.e., enhancing inhibitory neurotransmitters), or suppressing the \\"bottom-up\\" part (i.e., decreasing excitatory neurotransmitters). The hypothesis appears consistent with the current psychopharmacological understanding of these agents, as well as to account for the likely multifactorial etiology of the condition.

Generally, training a deep CNN model requires numerous labeled training samples, and the number and quality of these samples directly affect the representational capability of the trained model. However, this approach is restrictive in practice, because manually labeling such a large number of training samples is time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an active learning method for deep visual tracking, which selects and annotates the unlabeled samples to train the deep CNNs model. Under the guidance of active learning, the tracker based on the trained deep CNNs model can achieve competitive tracking performance while reducing the labeling cost. More specifically, to ensure the diversity of selected samples, we propose an active learning method based on multi-frame collaboration to select those training samples that should be and need to be annotated. Meanwhile, considering the representativeness of these selected samples, we adopt a nearest neighbor discrimination method based on the average nearest neighbor distance to screen isolated samples and low-quality samples. Therefore, the training samples subset selected based on our method requires only a given budget to maintain the diversity and representativeness of the entire sample set. Furthermore, we adopt a Tversky loss to improve the bounding box estimation of our tracker, which can ensure that the tracker achieves more accurate target states. Extensive experimental results confirm that our active learning-based tracker (ALT) achieves competitive tracking accuracy and speed compared with state-of-the-art trackers on the seven most challenging evaluation benchmarks.","output":"Active Learning for Deep Visual Tracking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To systematically evaluate the effects of Chinese herbal medicine in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Methodological quality of trials was assessed in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and intention-to-treat. Exploring analysis was carried out on the non-randomized clinical controlled studies. Two authors collected data independently and evaluated quality and results. The data were quantified by Meta-analysis. RESULTS Eight RCTs (488 SARS patients) were included. The methodological quality was generally low. Results of Meta-analysis showed that the integrative therapy could significantly reduce the mortality (relative risk 0.32 [95% CI 0.12 - 0.91]) and the occurrence of fungal infection in patients who received hormone (glucocorticoid) therapy (0.35: 0.14 - 0.90), shorten the duration of fever (weighted mean difference -0.83 day; -1.30 - -0.35) and symptom relieving time (-1.23; -2.09 - -0.37), reduce the persistent time of chest radiograph abnormalities (- 2.61; -3.74 - -1.49). But it showed no significant difference on quality of life or glucocorticoid dosage.

Methods An online cross-sectional study was conducted among the sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the authors network with the popular media such as Facebook, in Ethiopia from the April 15-22, 2020 and successfully recruited 341 responses. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit the participants. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the level of knowledge and practices. Results The majority of the respondents (80.35%) were male. The overall prevention knowledge of the participants towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was high. About 91.2% of the participant was heard about the novel coronavirus disease and Social Medias were the main source of the information. About 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing. The practices of the participants towards the COVID-19 prevention were very low. Out of 341 participants, only 61% and 84% of the participants were practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively. Conclusions Majority of the participants had knew the ways of protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus. But, there was deficiencies of changing these prevention knowledge to practice. This indicates that there was gap between knowledge and implementation of prevention strategies in the community.

METHODS In September 2020, an online survey was conducted with n = 13,277 working-age individuals with and without disabilities to gather information about food sufficiency prior to COVID-19 (i.e., in March 2020) and within the last seven days as well as receipt of free groceries or meals, use of food programs or pantries, and concerns with using free food sources over the past week. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to compare these measures for persons with and without disabilities. RESULTS Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, the proportion of working-age persons who were food sufficient decreased from March 2020 to September 2020 for persons with disabilities (65%-57%, an eight-percentage point decrease) and for persons without disabilities (78%-73%, a five-percentage point decrease). The rates of change were not significantly different between groups. In September 2020, higher proportions of persons with disabilities (58%) used free food resources in the past week than persons without disabilities (41%).

A recombinant nucleocapsid antigen specifically captures SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient specimens. A labelled anti-human IgA reveals the bound IgA fraction. A dual colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection enables the affordable and ultrasensitive determination of IgA to SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, a simple smartphone-camera-based device measures the colour signal provided by nanogold-labelled anti-human IgA. For the ultrasensitive chemiluminescence transduction, we used a contact imaging portable device based on cooled CCD, and measured the light signal resulting from the reaction of the HRP-labelled anti-human IgA with a H(2)O(2)/luminol/enhancers substrate. A total of 25 serum and 9 saliva samples from infected and/or recovered individuals were analysed by the colorimetric LFIA, which was sensitive and reproducible enough for the semi-quantification of IgA in subjects with a strong serological response and in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Switching to CL detection, the same immunosensor exhibited higher detection capability, revealing the presence of salivary IgA in infected individuals. For the patients included in the study (n = 4), the level of salivary IgA correlated with the time elapsed from diagnosis and with the severity of the disease.

Recently, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques has provided a new scope for more detailed imaging analysis in esophageal cancer (EC) patients. Our review aims to explore the recent advances and future perspective of the ML technique in the disease management of EC patients. ML-based investigations can be used for diagnosis, treatment response evaluation, prognostication, and investigation of biological heterogeneity. The key results from the literature have demonstrated the potential of ML techniques, such as radiomic techniques and deep learning networks, to improve the decision-making process for EC patients in clinical practice. Recommendations have been made to improve study design and future applicability. ABSTRACT: Esophageal cancer (EC) is of public health significance as one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Accurate staging, treatment planning and prognostication in EC patients are of vital importance. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques demonstrate their potential to provide novel quantitative imaging markers in medical imaging. Radiomics approaches that could quantify medical images into high-dimensional data have been shown to improve the imaging-based classification system in characterizing the heterogeneity of primary tumors and lymph nodes in EC patients. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence of the most recent developments in ML application in imaging pertinent to EC patient care. According to the published results, ML models evaluating treatment response and lymph node metastasis achieve reliable predictions, ranging from acceptable to outstanding in their validation groups. Patients stratified by ML models in different risk groups have a significant or borderline significant difference in survival outcomes. Prospective large multi-center studies are suggested to improve the generalizability of ML techniques with standardized imaging protocols and harmonization between different centers.","output":"Machine Learning and Radiomics Applications in Esophageal Cancers Using Non-Invasive Imaging MethodsA Critical Review of Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Although recent census demonstrates that women comprise 50.8% and ethnic minority groups collectively consist of 42.1% of the US population, the field of anesthesiology still demonstrates disparity in representation and health outcomes across race, ethnicity, and gender. In addition, the growing percentage of people that identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) compounded with limited representation among providers of their care can augment existing disparate outcomes within this community. RECENT FINDINGS Compared to male colleagues, women physicians across all specialties have a decreased likelihood of professorship as well as equitable pay and leadership roles. Additionally, a 2019 study of anesthesia residents across race and ethnicity within the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education established that whites were 58.9%, Asians were 24.7%, Hispanics were 7.8%, Blacks were 5.9%, multiracial groups were 3.8%, and Native Americans were 0.3% of the total 6272 residents. In a survey of members of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, self-identification as part of the sexual and gender minoritycommunity was independently associated with an increased risk of burnout. Furthermore, teams with higher diversity in cognitive styles solve problems more efficiently. SUMMARY To achieve an optimized quality of healthcare, anesthesiologists and other providers should be a reflection of the communities they serve, including women, people of color, and LGBTQ. In this way, there is an increased likelihood of empathy, effective communication, and insightful perspectives on how to bridge the gap in health equity.

METHODS: We surveyed 725 full-time college students aged 18-22 years recruited via Instagram promotions on April 25-30, 2020. We inquired about their COVID-19-related experiences and perspectives, documented opportunities for transmission, and assessed COVID-19's perceived impacts to date. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of participants experienced any COVID-19-related symptoms from February to April 2020, but less than 5% of them got tested, and only 46% stayed home exclusively while experiencing symptoms. Almost all (95%) had sheltered in place/stayed primarily at home by late April 2020; 53% started sheltering in place before any state had an official stay-at-home order, and more than one-third started sheltering before any metropolitan area had an order. Participants were more stressed about COVID-19's health implications for their family and for American society than for themselves. Participants were open to continuing the restrictions in place in late April 2020 for an extended period of time to reduce pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial opportunity for improved public health responses to COVID-19 among college students, including for testing and contact tracing. In addition, because most participants restricted their behaviors before official stay-at-home orders went into effect, they may continue to restrict movement after stay-at-home orders are lifted, including when colleges reopen for in-person activities, if they decide it is not yet prudent to circulate freely.

This paper will analyse the implications for insurance investing. We start by showing the impact of the severe drawdown in the equity markets during the initial phase of the crisis in March/April 2020 on a typical insurer's balance sheet. We then look at the effects of the dislocations in fixed income, which make up the largest share of exposures in insurance companies' portfolios. We track the performance of investment grade credit during the year while paying special attention to the impact of downgrades on insurers' solvency capital. We finally study alternative investments with particular focus on private markets. These investments are a faster-growing part of insurance companies' exposures and pose specific challenges as they are complex, more difficult to access, have limited liquidity and are often harder to price, especially during times of high market volatility. Yet, compared to their equivalent public market exposures, private investments provide additional income, which allows insurers to charge lower rates on their products to policyholders. As the sophistication and complexity of investments keep growing, companies as well as regulators need to find a good balance between policyholder protection and market efficiency.","output":"Vulnerabilities and resilience in insurance investing: studying the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute multifactorial infectious disease induced by trauma, pneumonia, shock, and sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of pseudoephedrine and emodin combined treatment in experimental ALI, as well as the mechanisms underlying the regulation of inflammation and pulmonary edema via the VIP/cAMP/PKA pathway. METHODS: The wistar rats were randomly divided into fifteen groups (n = 5). Rats in each group were given intragastric administration 1 h before LPS injection. Those in the control and LPS groups were given intragastric administrations of physiological saline, rats in other groups were given intragastrically administered of differential dose therapeutic agents. The rats in the LPS and treatment groups were then injected intraperitoneally with LPS (7.5 mg/kg) to induce ALI. After being treated with pseudoephedrine and emodin for 12 h, all animals were sacrifice. Anal temperatures were taken on an hourly basis for 8 h after LPS injection. Pathological examination of lung specimen was performed by H&E staining. Cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, iNOS, IL-10, Arg-1, CD86, CD206, F4/80, VIP) in lung tissue were assayed by ELISA and immunofluorescence.

The purpose of this study is to explain the acceptance and usage of SCOs and therefore extend the technology acceptance model (TAM;Davis, 1989) with other theories (i.e., uses and gratification, diffusion of innovation, privacy calculus), and thus new antecedents adapted to the SCO context. More specifically, in addition to the TAM's main variables (i.e., perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention to use, real use), we investigate the roles of concepts rarely investigated in innovation and new technology research, such as well-being, social image, privacy concerns, and innovativeness. We also study the differences in the adoption of SCOs between different user adoption stages, such as the early adopters, early majority, and late majority (Rogers, 1983). The data come from 702 respondents surveyed in a longitudinal study over three years of their acceptance and real usage. Structural equation modeling shows that the TAM variables remain relevant in the SCO context.

Molecular techniques have a great number of advantages such as an excellent sensitivity, specificity, adaptability to emerging viruses, capability for multiplex and for automation. With all the available repertoire of techniques for microbiological diagnosis, the knowledge relative to respiratory viruses is growing up not only for new aetiological agents but also for its epidemiology. The advances in molecular and non-molecular fast diagnostic methods for one or more respiratory viruses allow quick decisions in the management of the patient. However, there are also disadvantages. The great sensitivity of molecular techniques has meant a significant increase in the rate of multiple detections of respiratory viruses, whose clinical involvement is difficult to interpret.

This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australias unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry.

Because the genome sequence for one of these isolates is available, we conducted comparative evolutionary analyses of the spike gene of this strain (CCoV-HuPn-2018), with other available Alphacoronavirus 1 spike sequences. The most N-terminus subdomain (0-domain) of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike protein has sequence similarity to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and CCoV2b strains, but not to other members of the type II Alphacoronaviruses (i.e., CCoV2a and Feline CoV2-FCoV2). This 0-domain in CCoV-HuPn-2018 has evidence for relaxed selection pressure, an increased rate of molecular evolution, and a number of unique amino acid substitutions relative to CCoV2b and TGEV sequences. A region of the 0-domain determined to be key to sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV had clear differences in amino acid sequences in CCoV-HuPn-2018 relative to both CCoV2b (enteric) and TGEV (enteric and respiratory). The 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 also had several sites inferred to be under positive diversifying selection, including sites within the signal peptide. Downstream of the 0-domain, FCoV2 shared sequence similarity to the CCoV2b and TGEV sequences, with analyses of this larger alignment identifying positively selected sites in the putative Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Connector Domain (CD). Recombination analyses strongly implicated a particular FCoV2 strain in the recombinant history of CCoV-HuPn-2018 with molecular divergence times estimated at around 60 years ago. We hypothesize that CCoV-HuPn-2018 had an enteric origin, but that it has lost that particular tropism, because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain. As selection pressure on this region was reduced, the virus evolved a respiratory tropism, analogous to other Alphacoronavirus 1, such as Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV), that have lost this region entirely. We also suggest that signals of positive selection in the signal peptide as well as other changes in the 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 could represent an adaptive role in this new host and that this could be in part due to the different spatial distribution of the N-linked glycan repertoire for this strain.","output":"Recent zoonotic spillover and tropism shift of a Canine Coronavirus is associated with relaxed selection and putative loss of function in NTD subdomain of spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Edge computing is a novel technology, which is closely related to the concept of Internet of Things.

ABSTRACT: Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ), the flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb., has been used to treat some human diseases including severe respiratory syndromes and hand-foot-and-mouth diseases owing to its putative antibacterial, and antiviral effects. Luteoloside is a flavonoid that is used by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia to evaluate the quality of FLJ. Light is an important environmental factor that affects flavonoid biosynthesis in the flower buds of L. japonica. However, how light triggers increases in flavonoid production remains unclear. To enhance our understanding of the mechanism involved in light-regulated flavonoid biosynthesis, we sequenced the transcriptomes of L. japonica exposed to three different light conditions: 100% light intensity (CK), 50% light intensity (LI50), and 25% light intensity (LI25) using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 System. A total of 77,297 unigenes with an average length of 809 bp were obtained. Among them, 43,334 unigenes (56.06%) could be matched to at least one biomolecular database. Additionally, 4188, 1545 and 1023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparative transcriptomics LI25-vs-CK, LI50-vs-CK, and LI25-vs-LI50, respectively. Of note, genes known to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, such as 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL), and chalcone synthase (CHS) were up-regulated. In addition, a total of 1649 transcription factors (TFs) were identified and divided into 58 TF families; 98 TFs exhibited highly dynamic changes in response to light intensity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression profiles of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. This study offers insight into how transcriptional expression pattern is influenced by light in the flower buds of L. japonica, and will enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis in response to light in L. japonica.

METHODS: Using a national representative sample of adults in the United States (n = 585,073), we fitted logistic regressions to examine the overall associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and GAD/MDD. We employed a causal mediation analysis with two mediators: cognitive concerns (i.e., concerns on going to the public, loss of income, food insufficiency, housing payment, and the economy) and behavioral changes (i.e., taking fewer trips, avoiding eating-out, more online-purchase, more curbside pick-up, and cancelling doctor's appointments). RESULTS: We found relationships of statewide COVID-19 cases with GAD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05, 1.07) and MDD (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.07, 1.09). The ORs were mediated by cognitive concerns for GAD (OR = 1.02, proportion mediated: 29%) and MDD (OR = 1.01, 17%). Another salient mediator was behavioral changes for GAD (OR = 1.02, 31%) and MDD (OR = 1.01, 15%). Similar associations were found with statewide COVID-19 death.

RECENT FINDINGS: In vitro and in vivo studies have better elucidated the neurotropism of various respiratory viruses. Understanding host cell receptors that mediate viral binding and entry not only demonstrates how viruses enter host cells but also provides possible mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 binding and fusion with host cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may also provide greater insights into its systemic and neurologic sequelae. Respiratory virus neurotropism and collateral injury due to concurrent inflammatory cascades result in various neurologic pathologies, including Guillain-Barr syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and seizures. SUMMARY: Numerous respiratory viruses can infect the cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems, elicit inflammatory cascades, and directly and indirectly cause various neurologic manifestations.

However, there is little information about the clinical relevance of cell-free DNA genotyping in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Materials and Methods: After targeted sequencing plasma cell-free DNA of patients with various subtypes of PTCL (n=94), we analyzed the mutation profiles of plasma ctDNA samples and their predictive value of dynamic ctDNA monitoring for treatment outcomes. Results: Plasma ctDNA mutations were detected in 53 patients (56%, 53/94), and the detection rate of somatic mutations was highest in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (24/31, 77%) and PTCL, not otherwise specified (18/29, 62.1%). Somatic mutations were detected in 51 of 66 genes that were sequenced, including the following top 10 ranked genes: RHOA, CREBBP, KMT2D, TP53, IDH2, ALK, MEF2B, SOCS1, CARD11, and KRAS. In the longitudinal assessment of ctDNA mutation, the difference in ctDNA mutation volume after treatment showed a significant correlation with disease relapse or progression. Thus, a  1.5-log decrease in genome equivalent (GE) between baseline and the end of treatment showed a significant association with better survival outcomes than a < 1.5-log decrease in GE.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic and exposure data from physical therapists from April to May 2020. All physical therapists working in an inpatient and outpatient care in Italy were eligible. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all eligible physical therapists to collect (1) demographic characteristics, (2-3) personal- and work-related exposures, and (4) signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Factors associated with a COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were explored through logistic regression models and multivariate methods. RESULTS: A total of 15,566 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 43.3%, achieving high statistical precision (99% CI, 1% type I error). Among physical therapists who received NPS testing, 13.1% (95% CI = 12.1-14.1%) had a positive result, with a peak reached in March 2020 (36%). The top five symptoms were fatigue and tiredness (69.1%), loss of smell (64.5%), aches and pains (60.8%), loss of taste (58.3%), and headache (51.1%). No symptoms were reported by 8.9%. Working in a health care institution [odds ratio (OR) = 7.2; 95% CI = 5.4-9.7], being reallocated to a different unit (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3-2.2) and changing job tasks (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2) increased the risk of being COVID-19 positive. In therapists with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, comorbidities were associated with male sex and age older than 51 years. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave in Italy, almost 1 out of 7 physical therapists tested positive on the COVID-19 NPS test. Considering personal- and work-related exposures, health care organizations should adopt prevention measures and adequate preparedness to prevent high rate of infections during future pandemics.

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.","output":"Evolutionary trajectory for the emergence of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: There is an increasing need for remote monitoring in childhood respiratory disease, however many tools rely on active adherence, technique, or subjectivity. Respiratory rate (RR) is an important and objective sign, yet is underutilized;no reliable methods for long-term monitoring exist. Current gold-standards-wearable polysomnography devices (PSG)-measure nocturnal RR using uncomfortable sensors such as effort belts and nasal cannulae and are suitable only for discrete, single-night recordings, particularly in children. In the post-COVID-19 era, reliable and accepted RR monitoring in the home will have significant potential for improving respiratory clinical care and research. METHODS: In a healthy pediatric population, we evaluated accuracy of a passive, non-contact bedside device (Albus Home RD) that uses wireless motion sensors to capture RR, as compared to a goldstandard, wearable PSG (SOMNOtouch? RESPIRATORY, by Somnomedics). The table-top Albus Home RD was positioned adjacent to participants in their home bedroom environment. Sleeping conditions were normal and varied in bed-size, presence of bed-or room-sharers, clothing, and bedding. Gold-standard PSG RR data were recorded using manual count of the raw respiratory traces derived from thoracoabdominal respiratory-effort belts. 10-minute periods from each hour of monitoring were chosen, where sufficient data were available and free from confounding movement and artefacts. Data from Albus Home RD were then analyzed using proprietary signal processing algorithms to output corresponding 30-second RR segments (as breaths/minute). RR results for each device for the selected segments were time-synchronized and compared for each 30-second segment. As per previous respiratory rate validation literature, accuracy was reported as proportion of RR measurements within +/-10% or +/-2 breaths/minute of the PSG RR. RESULTS: 9 healthy children (6 males, 3 females) participated in overnight monitoring;ages and BMI ranged 6-16 years and 13.3-20.0 respectively. Albus Home RD RR measurements for 1220 thirty-second RR segments were compared against the gold-standard with overall accuracy of 93%. Mean Absolute Percentage Error was 0.05 (SD=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Albus Home RD passively measured nocturnal RR with 93% accuracy in 610 minutes of analysis in real-world environments compared to the current gold-standard. Using wireless sensors and proprietary signal processing algorithms, the Albus Home RD is a valid bedside, non-contact monitor of RR for children aged 6-16 years-old. The nontouch, passive nature of this monitor could enable previously infeasible longitudinal home monitoring in clinical care and research. This low-burden system has significant potential to facilitate longer-term, remote monitoring in pediatric respiratory disease.","output":"Pediatric nocturnal respiratory rate monitoring using a non-contact and passive bedside device: Accuracy of the albus home research device (RD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) is a chronic, complex, heterogeneous disease that affects millions and lacks both diagnostics and treatments.

Industrial clusters are one of the important means by which the pharmaceutical industry can be transformed and developed, but there is a lack of research on the evolutionary path and development innovation of pharmaceutical industrial clusters. As a country with a major pharmaceutical industry, the transformation and development path of traditional pharmaceutical industrial clusters in China has important reference value for the sustainable development of the global pharmaceutical industry. Through an analysis of the evolution of traditional pharmaceutical industrial clusters in Shijiazhuang, this study explores the law of the dynamic evolution of pharmaceutical industrial clusters and the associated mechanisms. Specifically, we conclude that the evolutionary path of traditional pharmaceutical industrial clusters can be divided into the government-led pharmaceutical industrial cluster start-up stage, the government-guided pharmaceutical industrial cluster development stage, and the government-served pharmaceutical industrial cluster transformation stage. The operating mechanisms include a self-organization mechanism, an innovation-driven mechanism, and an outward associated mechanism, each of which plays different roles in the different stages of the dynamic evolution of the cluster, and the synergistic operation of the three mechanisms forms an important basis for the evolution of pharmaceutical industrial clusters. We found that the innovation development of traditional pharmaceutical industrial clusters is influenced by the synergy of the self-organization, innovation-driven, and outward associated mechanisms. The self-organization mechanism is a necessary condition for pharmaceutical industrial clusters to realize the transition from disorder to order. The innovation-driven mechanism is the core driving force for the innovative development of pharmaceutical industrial clusters. Finally, the outward associated mechanism is the main means by which pharmaceutical industrial clusters integrate into the global value chain.","output":"Evolutionary Path and Innovative Development of Pharmaceutical Industrial ClusterA Case Study of Shijiazhuang, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic caused by coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

OBJECTIVE: To summarize current evidence on vaccine responses and identify risk factors for diminished humoral immune response in recipients of SOT. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted from existence of database through December 15, 2021, using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting humoral immune response of the COVID-19 vaccines in recipients of SOT were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data from each eligible study. Descriptive statistics and a random-effects model were used. This report was prepared following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Data were analyzed from December 2021 to February 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The total numbers of positive immune responses and percentage across each vaccine platform were recorded. Pooled odds ratios (pORs) with 95% CIs were used to calculate the pooled effect estimates of risk factors for poor antibody response. RESULTS: A total of 83 studies were included for the systematic review, and 29 studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 11 713 recipients of SOT. The weighted mean (range) of total positive humoral response for antispike antibodies after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was 10.4% (0%-37.9%) for 1 dose, 44.9% (0%-79.1%) for 2 doses, and 63.1% (49.1%-69.1%) for 3 doses. In 2 studies, 50% of recipients of SOT with no or minimal antibody response after 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine mounted an antibody response after a fourth dose. Among the factors associated with poor antibody response were older age (mean [SE] age difference between responders and nonresponders, 3.94 [1.1] years), deceased donor status (pOR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.83]; I(2) = 0%), antimetabolite use (pOR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.14-0.29]; I(2) = 70%), recent rituximab exposure (pOR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.61]; I(2) = 0%), and recent antithymocyte globulin exposure (pOR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15-0.71]; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the rates of positive antibody response in solid organ transplant recipients remained low despite multiple doses of mRNA vaccines. These findings suggest that more efforts are needed to modulate the risk factors associated with reduced humoral responses and to study monoclonal antibody prophylaxis among recipients of SOT who are at high risk of diminished humoral response.","output":"Immunogenicity and Risk Factors Associated With Poor Humoral Immune Response of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Recipients of Solid Organ Transplant: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Immunosuppressive agents are theorized to target the cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19. However, the downstream effects regarding susceptibilities to secondary infection risk remains unknown. This study seeks to determine risk differences for secondary infections among COVID-19 patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Methods: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study from two large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut from March 1, to May 31, 2020. We collected variables using manual medical record abstraction. The primary exposure variable was any dose of tocilizumab. The primary outcome was any healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network. We performed a KaplanCMeier analysis to assess the crude difference in cumulative probability of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) across exposure groups. We also performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis to determine the hazard ratio for HAI by exposure group while controlling for potential confounders. Results: The KaplanCMeier analysis demonstrated no difference in the cumulative probability of HAI across groups. The adjusted hazard of HAI for patients given tocilizumab was 0.85 times that of patients not given tocilizumab (95% confidence interval = 0.29, 2.52, P = 0.780) after controlling for relevant confounders. Conclusions: Tocilizumab did not increase the incidence of secondary infection among COVID-19 patients.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Compliance with UK multidisciplinary guidelines, and rates of cancer recurrence detection by time, clinic type and symptoms. RESULTS Data were analysed from 5,123 consultations across 89 UK centres. 30% of consultations were in dedicated multidisciplinary clinics, with input from Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) available on the day in 23% of all consultations. Recurrence was suspected in 344 consultations and investigated with MRI in 29.6% (n=102) and PET-CT in 14.2% (n=49). Patient education regarding recurrence symptoms, and smoking and alcohol advice, was provided in 20.4%, 6.2%, and 5.3% of cases, respectively. Rates of recurrence detected were 35% in expedited appointments and 5.2% in planned follow-ups (p=0.0001). Of the expedited appointments, 63% were initiated by patients and 37% by clinicians.

Due to travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, most in-person POCUS training courses were cancelled. Though tele-ultrasound technology has existed for several years, use of tele-ultrasound technology to deliver hands-on training during a POCUS CME course has not been previously described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing educational outcomes, course evaluations, and learner and faculty feedback from in-person versus tele-ultrasound POCUS courses. The same POCUS educational curriculum was delivered to learners by the two course formats. Data from the most recent pre-pandemic in-person course were compared to tele-ultrasound courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Pre- and post-course knowledge test scores of learners from the in-person (n = 88) and tele-ultrasound course (n = 52) were compared. Though mean pre-course knowledge test scores were higher among learners of the tele-ultrasound versus in-person course (78% vs. 71%; p = 0.001), there was no significant difference in the post-course test scores between learners of the two course formats (89% vs. 87%; p = 0.069). Both learners and faculty rated the tele-ultrasound course highly (4.6C5.0 on a 5-point scale) for effectiveness of virtual lectures, tele-ultrasound hands-on scanning sessions, and course administration. Faculty generally expressed less satisfaction with their ability to engage with learners, troubleshoot image acquisition, and provide feedback during the tele-ultrasound course but felt learners completed the tele-ultrasound course with a better basic POCUS skillset. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a traditional in-person course, tele-ultrasound POCUS CME courses appeared to be as effective for improving POCUS knowledge post-course and fulfilling learning objectives. Our findings can serve as a roadmap for educators seeking guidance on development of a tele-ultrasound POCUS training course whose demand will likely persist beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

ORM is constituted by three reliabilities, human resources, information technology, and management, which are mediators through which Type-1 and Type-2 reliability capabilities influence organizational reliability. Organizational reliability is a prerequisite for sustainability of contemporary organizations. The model was developed and verified for a variety of operating conditions. However, crisis induced by a Black Swan type of event creates conditions so critical that it calls for verification of known paradigms and models, as an element of crisis-state theory building. This is why this paper's aim was to verify the ORM and explain the mechanisms of shaping organizational reliability in such conditions in order to contribute to both theory (verifying the organizational reliability paradigm among organizations in crisis) and practice (proposing mechanisms, potentially helping them survive). The ORM is empirically verified based on the sample of 115 employees from Italy operating under critical conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic (research carried out in the week of 18-22 March 2020). In order to verify the hypothesis, the path analysis was executed using SPSS AMOS. The results confirmed that in the extreme critical conditions causing crisis escalation for the organizations, there is a need to redefine the existing paradigms, including ORM. The results show that the HR reliability role in the ORM has drastically changed and the mechanism of its influence on organizational reliability is significantly different in crisis influenced by critical conditions of organization functioning.

However, data regarding myeloid cell expansion have been collected in Europe, where the mortality rate by COVID-19 is greater than those in other regions including Japan. Thus, characteristics of COVID-19-induced myeloid cell subsets remain largely unknown in the regions with low mortality rates. Here, we analyzed cellular dynamics of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets and examined whether any of them correlate with disease severity and prognosis, using blood samples from Japanese COVID-19 patients. We observed that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases. Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in non-survivors in Japanese cohort. Analysis of plasma cytokine/chemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMN-MDSC frequencies with IL-8 levels, indicating the involvement of IL-8 on recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID-19. Our data indicate that transient expansion of the PMN-MDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome.

We aimed to assess the impact of introducing highly sensitive fluorescent microscopy for examining sputum smear to replace conventional microscopy under a high TB risk setting. METHODS: We measured the impact of switch to fluorescent microscopy on the smear detection rate of culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, timing of respiratory isolation, and total non-isolated infectious person-days in hospital at a high-caseload medical center (approximately 400 TB cases annually) in Taipei. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to adjust for effects of covariates. The effect attributable to the improved smear detection rate was determined using causal mediation analysis. RESULTS: After switch to fluorescence microscopy, median non-isolated infectious duration decreased from 12.5 days to 3 days (P<0.001). Compared with conventional microscopy, fluorescence microscopy increased sputum smear detection rate by two-fold (for all patients: from 22.8% to 48.1%, P<0.001; for patients with cavitary lung lesion: from 43% to 82%, P = 0.029) and was associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of prompt respiratory isolation (odds ratio mediated by the increase in sputum smear detection rate: 1.8, 95% CI 1.3C2.5). Total non-isolated infectious patient-days in hospital decreased by 69% (from 4,778 patient-days per year to 1,502 patient-days per year).

Here we sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the cytokine storm that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. METHOD: Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. An AI-based approach was used to explore the utility of the signature in navigating the uncharted territory of Covid-19, setting therapeutic goals, and finding therapeutic solutions. FINDINGS: The 166-gene signature was surprisingly conserved across all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determine severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals could be formulated; these goals were met in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using either neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2?ACE2 engagement or a directly acting antiviral agent, EIDD-2801. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine prognosticated disease severity. INTERPRETATION: The ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.

Based on their analysis of these data, Mast et al. concluded that mRNA expression of key regulators of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Notably, they reported that the expression of the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator Tissue Factor (F3) remained unchanged, while there was an 8-fold upregulation of its cognate inhibitor Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). From this they conclude that pulmonary fibrin deposition does not stem from enhanced local [tissue factor] production and that counterintuitively, COVID-19 may dampen [tissue factor]-dependent mechanisms in the lungs. They also reported decreased Activated Protein C (aPC) mediated anticoagulant activity and major increases in fibrinogen expression and other key regulators of clot formation. Many of these results are contradictory to findings in most of the field, particularly the findings regarding extrinsic coagulation cascade mediated coagulopathies.

Although ZBP1-mediated cell death is widely described, whether and how it promotes inflammatory signaling is unclear. Here, we report a ZBP1-induced inflammatory signaling pathway that depends on ubiquitination and RIPK3s scaffolding ability independently of cell death. In human cells, ZBP1 associates with RIPK1 and RIPK3 as well as ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and LUBAC. RIPK1 and ZBP1 are ubiquitinated to promote TAK1- and IKK-mediated inflammatory signaling. Additionally, RIPK1 recruits the p43/41-caspase-8-p43-FLIP heterodimer to suppress RIPK3 kinase activity, which otherwise promotes inflammatory signaling in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Lastly, we show that ZBP1 contributes to SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine production.

By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92% and 100%, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60%), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64%) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48% and 20%, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Comparison of three TaqMan Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR assays in detecting SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the United States prepares to return to work and open up the economy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic without an available vaccine or effective therapy, testing and contact tracing are essential to contain and limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In response to the urgent public health need for accurate, effective, low-cost, and scalable COVID-19 testing technology, we evaluated and identified diagnostic solutions with potential for use as an at-home product. We conducted a deep horizon scan for antigen and serology-based diagnostics and down-selected to the most promising technologies. A total of 303 candidate products (138 antibody and 44 antigen tests) were identified. Product evaluations were based entirely on company-provided data. 73 serology-based antibody tests passing an initial scoring algorithm based on specificity and sensitivity data were then further evaluated using a second scoring algorithm. This second algorithm included a review of additional technical specifications of the devices, an analysis of supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution capacity of each vendor. 24 potential antibody products met the selection criteria for further direct laboratory evaluation. The performance metrics for selection of these 24 products are currently being evaluated in a Mass General Brigham laboratory. Testing alone might not be sufficient to prevent the spread of a highly contagious disease like COVID-19. Manual contact tracing could complement testing, but it is likely to fail in identifying many individuals who were in contact with a given COVID patient. The proliferation of smartphones in the population has enabled the development of solutions that can provide public health officials with valuable information for rapid and accurate contact tracing. Besides, electronic-based contact tracing solutions can be augmented by symptom self-reports gathered using electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) platforms and by physiological data collected using wearable sensors. We performed a detailed assessment of 12 ePRO solutions, 27 wearable sensors, and 44 electronic-based contact tracing solutions. These technologies were evaluated using criteria developed to assess their suitability to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified a number of solutions that could augment if not provide a more effective alternative to manual contact tracing. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework in which ePRO platforms, wearable sensors, and electronic-based contact tracing solutions would be utilized in combination with molecular and serological tests to identify and isolate COVID-19 cases rapidly.","output":"Diagnostic technology for COVID-19: comparative evaluation of antigen and serology-based SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, and contact tracing solutions for potential use as at-home products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prime-boost vaccinations of humans with different H5 strains have generated broadly protective antibody levels. However, the effect of an individuals H5 exposure history on antibody responses to subsequent H5 vaccination is poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the IgG responses to H5 influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Ind05) virus vaccination in three cohorts: (i) a doubly primed group that had received two H5 virus vaccinations, namely, against influenza A/Vietnam/203/2004 (Vie04) virus 5 years prior and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (HK97) 11 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; (ii) a singly primed group that had received a vaccination against Vie04 virus 5 years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; and (iii) an H5-naive group that received two doses of the Ind05 vaccine 28 days apart. Hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive IgG levels were estimated by a multiplex assay against an HA panel that included 21 H5 strains and 9 other strains representing the H1, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. Relative HA antibody landscapes were generated to quantitatively analyze the magnitude and breadth of antibody binding after vaccination. We found that short-interval priming and boosting with the Ind05 vaccine in the naive group generated a low anti-H5 response. Both primed groups generated robust antibody responses reactive to a broad range of H5 strains after receiving a booster injection of Ind05 vaccine; IgG antibody levels persisted longer in subjects who had been doubly primed years ago. Notably, the IgG responses were strongest against the first priming H5 strain, which reflects influenza virus immune imprinting. Finally, the broad anti-H5 IgG response was stronger against strains having a small antigenic distance from the initial priming strain.","output":"Broadly Reactive IgG Responses to Heterologous H5 Prime-Boost Influenza Vaccination Are Shaped by Antigenic Relatedness to Priming Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Frontline Health Care Workers are at risk of developing mental and psychological distress during Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic. This study aimed to assess level of stress, anxiety, depression and their associated factors among health care workers during Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic in Nepal. METHODS This is a web based cross-sectional survey conducted among 404 Health Care Workers during early phase of Corona virus disease 2019 pandemic. The participants were selected using convenience sampling technique and were invited to participate via various online networks. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and their associated factors were measured using structured questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out to determine the associated factors. RESULTS The symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression among health care workers were found to be 28.9%, 35.6% and 17.0% respectively. Females were found to be 2 fold more likely to have anxiety and depression than male. Nurses were found to be two times more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Laboratory personnel were almost three folds more likely to have anxiety than doctors. Health care workers with insufficient/ no PPE were almost three fold more likely to have depression. health care workers working in high-risk areas had almost 2 fold higher odds of having depression. CONCLUSIONS Health care workers experienced symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression in varied level of severity. This experience was higher among the nurses and laboratory workers than doctors.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Findings: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

It is unclear whether adding gene panels to other risk tools improves breast cancer risk stratification and adds discriminatory benefit on a population basis. METHODS: In total, 10,025 of 57,902 women aged 46 to 73 years in the Predicting Risk of Cancer at Screening study provided DNA samples. A case-control study was used to evaluate breast cancer risk assessment using polygenic risk scores (PRSs), cancer gene panel (n = 33), mammographic density (density residual [DR]), and risk factors collected using a self-completed 2-page questionnaire (Tyrer-Cuzick [TC] model version 8). In total, 525 cases and 1410 controls underwent gene panel testing and PRS calculation (18, 143, and/or 313 single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]). RESULTS: Actionable pathogenic variants (PGVs) in BRCA1/2 were found in 1.7% of cases and 0.55% of controls, and overall PGVs were found in 6.1% of cases and 1.3% of controls. A combined assessment of TC8-DR-SNP313 and gene panel provided the best risk stratification with 26.1% of controls and 9.7% of cases identified at <1.4% 10-year risk and 9.01% of controls and 23.3% of cases at 8% 10-year risk. Because actionable PGVs were uncommon, discrimination was identical with/without gene panel (with/without: area under the curve = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.64-0.70). Only 7 of 17 PGVs in cases resulted in actionable risk category change. Extended case (n = 644)-control (n = 1779) series with TC8-DR-SNP143 identified 18.9% of controls and only 6.4% of stage 2+ cases at <1.4% 10-year risk and 20.7% of controls and 47.9% of stage 2+ cases at 5% 10-year risk.

Although the risk of COVID-19 infection is not increased in patients with inherited bleeding disorders, the indirect effects of this infection are many. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted among patients registered to our centre with inherited bleeding disorders. A web-based based questionnaire was developed and shared with patients and families. RESULTS: 120 patients/ families answered the questionnaire completely. During the period of lockdown, many had bleeds that were left untreated due to either difficulty in travel or unavailability of treatment. The time to treatment ranged from 8 h to 15 days in those who had a bleed. 36 % faced financial difficulties and 40 % families reported losing their job or source of income during this period. DISCUSSION: Few solutions that emerged while treating patients during this period and recommendations are discussed. Even though haemophilia has been included under the essential health services and states mandated to continue treatment for these patients despite the global crisis, patients still face challenges in terms of transport and finance.","output":"Taking on a pandemic's challenge: Emergent solutions from a single Hemophlia treatment center in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is often assumed that recreational fishing has negligible impact on fish stocks compared to commercial fishing. Yet, for inland water bodies in densely populated areas, this is unlikely to be true. In this study we demonstrate remarkably variable stock recovery rates among different fish species with similar life histories in a large productive inland freshwater ecosystem (Kaunas Reservoir, Lithuania), where all commercial fishing has been banned since 2013. We conducted over 900 surveys of recreational anglers during a period of four years (2016 to 2021) to assess recreational fishing catches. These surveys are combined with drone and fishfinder device-based assessment of recreational fishing effort. Fish population recovery rates were assessed using standardised catch per unit effort time series. We show that recreational fishing is having a major impact in retarding the recovery of predatory species, such as pikeperch and perch. In contrast, recovery of roach, rarely caught by anglers, has been remarkably rapid and the species is now dominating the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates that recreational fishing can have strong impacts on some fish species, alter relative species composition and potentially change ecosystem state and dynamics.","output":"Impacts of recreational angling on fish population recovery after a commercial fishing ban"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In every field of life, advanced technology has become a rapid outcome, particularly in the medical field.

To inform updated WHO guidelines, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of alternative screening tests and strategies for tuberculosis in this population. METHODS: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we updated a search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts for publications from Jan 1, 2011, to March 12, 2018, done in a previous systematic review to include the period up to Aug 2, 2019. We screened the reference lists of identified pieces and contacted experts in the field. We included prospective cross-sectional, observational studies and randomised trials among adult and adolescent (age 10 years) ambulatory people living with HIV, irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. We extracted study-level data using a standardised data extraction form, and we requested individual participant data from study authors. We aimed to compare the W4SS with alternative screening tests and strategies and the WHO-recommended algorithm (ie, W4SS followed by Xpert) with Xpert for all in terms of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), overall and in key subgroups (eg, by antiretroviral therapy [ART] status). The reference standard was culture. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020155895. FINDINGS: We identified 25 studies, and obtained data from 22 studies (including 15 666 participants; 4347 [277%] of 15 663 participants with data were on ART). W4SS sensitivity was 82% (95% CI 72-89) and specificity was 42% (29-57). C-reactive protein (10 mg/L) had similar sensitivity to (77% [61-88]), but higher specificity (74% [61-83]; n=3571) than, W4SS. Cough (lasting 2 weeks), haemoglobin (<10 g/dL), body-mass index (<185 kg/m2), and lymphadenopathy had high specificities (80-90%) but low sensitivities (29-43%). The WHO-recommended algorithm had a sensitivity of 58% (50-66) and a specificity of 99% (98-100); Xpert for all had a sensitivity of 68% (57-76) and a specificity of 99% (98-99). In the one study that assessed both, the sensitivity of sputum Xpert Ultra was higher than sputum Xpert (73% [62-81] vs 57% [47-67]) and specificities were similar (98% [96-98] vs 99% [98-100]). Among outpatients on ART (4309 [991%] of 4347 people on ART), W4SS sensitivity was 53% (35-71) and specificity was 71% (51-85). In this population, a parallel strategy (two tests done at the same time) of W4SS with any chest x-ray abnormality had higher sensitivity (89% [70-97]) and lower specificity (33% [17-54]; n=2670) than W4SS alone; at a tuberculosis prevalence of 5%, this strategy would require 379 more rapid diagnostic tests per 1000 people living with HIV than W4SS but detect 18 more tuberculosis cases. Among outpatients not on ART (11 160 [718%] of 15 541 outpatients), W4SS sensitivity was 85% (76-91) and specificity was 37% (25-51). C-reactive protein (10 mg/L) alone had a similar sensitivity to (83% [79-86]), but higher specificity (67% [60-73]; n=3187) than, W4SS and a sequential strategy (both test positive) of W4SS then C-reactive protein (5 mg/L) had a similar sensitivity to (84% [75-90]), but higher specificity than (64% [57-71]; n=3187), W4SS alone; at 10% tuberculosis prevalence, these strategies would require 272 and 244 fewer rapid diagnostic tests per 1000 people living with HIV than W4SS but miss two and one more tuberculosis cases, respectively. INTERPRETATION: C-reactive protein reduces the need for further rapid diagnostic tests without compromising sensitivity and has been included in the updated WHO tuberculosis screening guidelines. However, C-reactive protein data were scarce for outpatients on ART, necessitating future research regarding the utility of C-reactive protein in this group. Chest x-ray can be useful in outpatients on ART when combined with W4SS. The WHO-recommended algorithm has suboptimal sensitivity; Xpert for all offers slight sensitivity gains and would have major resource implications.

There has not been any direct evidence for SARS-CoV-2 leakage through the membrane in ECMO support for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The precise pore structure of recent membranes was elucidated by direct microscopic observation for the first time. The three types of membranes, polypropylene, polypropylene coated with thin silicone layer, and polymethylpentene (PMP), have unique pore structures, and the pore structures on the inner and outer surfaces of the membranes are completely different anisotropic structures. From these data, the partition coefficients and intramembrane diffusion coefficients of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using the membrane transport model. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may permeate the membrane wall with the plasma filtration flow or wet lung. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 permeation is completely different due to each anisotropic pore structure. We theoretically demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is highly likely to permeate the membrane transporting from the patients blood to the gas side, and may diffuse from the gas side outlet port of ECMO leading to the extra-circulatory spread of the SARS-CoV-2 (ECMO infection).

Most transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 occur in households. Methods: Using individual-level registry data of all Norwegian residents we compared infections across all multi-person households. A household with at least one member born abroad was defined as an immigrant household. For the subset of households where at least one person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from August 1st 2020 to May 1st 2021, we calculated secondary attack rates (SARs) as the percent of other household members testing positive within 14 days after the first household member tested positive. Logistic regression model was used to adjust for sex, age, household composition and geography. Results: Among all multi-person households in Norway (n=1 421 642), immigrant households (n=341 604) comprised more members on average (3.2) than households with only Norwegian-born members (2.8). The share of immigrant households where at least one member had been tested, was 56% (vs 49% in the households with only Norwegian-born members), and the share where at least one member was infected was 3.7% (vs 1.4% in households with only Norwegian-born members). Secondary attack rates were higher in immigrant (32%) than Norwegian-born households (20%). Results differed considerably by country of birth, with secondary attack rates particularly high in households from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Pakistan, also after adjustment for sex, age, household composition and geography. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more frequently introduced into multi-person immigrant households than into households with only Norwegian-born members, and transmission within the household occurs more frequently in immigrant households.

Method: A structured questionnaire was designed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the patients whose orthognathic treatment was temporarily cancelled. Results: Ninety-five questionnaires were returned giving a response rate of 65%. When asked if the delay due to the pandemic had caused emotional distress, 63% (51/81) agreed.

From a pathophysiological view, in the recent definition, sepsis has been defined as the result of a complex interaction between host response and the infecting organism, resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction, depending on microcirculatory derangement, cellular hypoxia/dysoxia driven by hypotension and, potentially, death. The high energy expenditure driven by a high metabolic state induced by the host response may rapidly lead to micronutrient depletion. This deficiency can result in alterations in normal energy homeostasis, free radical damage, and immune system derangement. In critically ill patients, micronutrients are still relegated to an ancillary role in the whole treatment, and always put in a second-line place or, frequently, neglected. Only some micronutrients have attracted the attention of a wider audience, and some trials, even large ones, have tested their use, with controversial results.

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a digital anonymous survey. Rheumatic patients  18 years from non-English-speaking PANLAR countries were included. Our survey included 3502 rheumatic patients living in more than 19 Latin-American countries. Median age of patients was 45.8(36C55) years and the majority (88.9%) was female. Most frequently self-reported disease was rheumatoid arthritis (48.4%). At least one anti-rheumatic treatment was suspended by 23.4% of patients. Fear of contracting SARS-Cov2 (27.7%) and economic issues (25%) were the most common reasons for drug discontinuation. Self-rated disease activity increased from 30 (7C50) to 45 (10C70) points during the pandemic. Communication with their rheumatologist during the pandemic was required by 55.6% of patients, mainly by telephone calls (50.2%) and social network messages (47.8%). An adequate knowledge about COVID-19 was observed in 43% of patients. Patients with rheumatic diseases in Latin America were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in self-rated disease activity, a reduction in medication adherence, and hurdles for medical follow-up were reported.

One such proposal is that the population frequencies of the so-called derived alleles of two genes involved in brain growth and development, ASPM and Microcephalin, are related to the probability of speaking a tone language or not. The original study introducing this proposal used a cross-linguistic statistical approach, showing that these associations are special when compared with many other possible relationships between genetic variants and linguistic features. Recent experimental evidence supports strongly a negative effect of the derived allele of ASPM on tone perception and/or processing within individuals, but failed to find any effect for Microcephalin. Motivated by these experimental findings, I conduct here a cross-linguistic statistical test, using a larger and updated dataset of 175 samples from 129 unique (meta)populations, and a battery of methods including mixed-effects regression (Bayesian and maximum-likelihood), mediation and path analysis, decision trees and random forests, using permutations and restricted sampling to control for the confounding effects of genealogy (language families) and contact (macroareas). Overall, the results support a negative weak effect of ASPM-D against the presence of tone above and beyond the strong confounding influences of genealogy and contact, but they suggest that the original association between tone and MCPH1 might have been a false positive, explained by differences between populations and languages within and outside Africa. Thus, these cross-linguistic population-scale statistical results are fully consonant with the inter-individual-level experimental results, and suggest that the observed linguistic diversity may be, at least in some cases, partly driven by genetic diversity.","output":"Tone and genes: New cross-linguistic data and methods support the weak negative effect of the derived allele of ASPM on tone, but not of Microcephalin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses with high rates of mortality, morbidity, and personal and societal costs. Onset of the Covid-19 pandemic led to increased ED diagnoses in the general public, as well as worsening of ED symptoms in those with an existing ED diagnosis. Heightened prevalence and severity of EDs during the pandemic is complicated by the fact that traditional modes of ED care (specialty intensive treatment provided by a multidisciplinary team) have been difficult to access during the pandemic. METHODS The current between-groups study (N = 93 ED) tested a multidisciplinary intensive outpatient program (IOP) delivered via in-person (pre-pandemic; n = 60) and virtually via telehealth (during the pandemic; n = 33). RESULTS We found no differences in outcomes via delivery mode, such that regardless of in-person versus telehealth programming, ED symptoms, depression, and perfectionism significantly decreased and body mass index significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that a multi-disciplinary telehealth ED IOP program is feasible and has comparable outcomes to in-person IOP treatment. These findings have implications for treatment beyond the pandemic, suggesting that adoption of telehealth IOPs is warranted. Such delivery modes of intensive treatments for EDs could be expanded to reach underserved populations, especially in rural areas where treatment is often difficult to access.","output":"Pilot outcomes from a multidisciplinary telehealth versus in-person intensive outpatient program for eating disorders during versus before the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUD: To analyze the correlation between gene polymorphisms of 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and risk of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL) in Chinese women. METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Established inclusion criteria were used to screening articles, subsequently evaluate the quality of the included studies, Stata 16.0 PM and RevMan 5.3 software were conducted for meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was determined to assess the relationship between MTHFR and risk of URPL in Chinese women. RESULTS: For MTHFR C677T, fifty studies were included, involving 6677 URPL cases and 8111 controls. The overall results showed that MTHFR C677T was significantly correlated with URPL risk, especially in the homozygous model (TT vs CC; OR 3.06; 95% CI 2.56C3.66). For MTHFR A1298C, twenty-first studies were included, involving 3439 URPL cases and 3155 controls. The results showed that MTHFR A1298C was also significantly correlated with URPL risk in recessive (CC vs AC + AA; OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.25C1.93) and homozygous (CC vs AA; OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.22C1.91) models. In addition, sub-group results showed that no significant difference between north and south China populations in the MTHFR gene polymorphisms and URPL risk. Of note, the patients carrying MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C joint mutants had no synergistic effect (OR 2.71; 95% CI 0.84C8.70) on the occurrence of URPL compared with the wild-type homozygous genotype (MTHFR 677CC/ MTHFR 1298AA). CONCLUSION: Studies included in this meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR 677T allele and 677TT genotype and MTHFR 1298CC genotype were both associated with URPL; testing MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism was a more appropriate target compared with other mutations in the prediction of URPL.","output":"The association between 5, 10 C methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and the risk of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss in China: A Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 occurs within the first weeks after COVID-19. Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike (S) and anti-Nucleocapsid (NP) IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19.

This scoping review, systematic review, and meta-analysis investigated associations between 100% OJ and markers of inflammation or oxidation in healthy adults and those at risk for chronic diseases. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and scoping review extension. Literature in English was searched to July 2021 in Embase and 4 Ovid platform databases. Clinical and observational studies of any duration were eligible. Cochrane Collaboration tools were used to assess the risk of bias in controlled trials. Strength of evidence was determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The scoping review presents a qualitative synthesis of evidence in summary and results tables. Twenty-one interventional studies (16 controlled trials and 5 before-after studies) conducted in 307 healthy and 327 at-risk participants were included. Six common markers [C-reactive protein (CRP) or high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), IL-6, TNF-, malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized LDL (oxLDL), and antioxidant capacity] measured across 16 studies were systematically reviewed, and results were synthesized narratively. Random-effects model meta-analyses were conducted on 10 studies reporting hs-CRP, IL-6, and/or MDA. After consuming 100% OJ, healthy and at-risk participants showed significantly lower IL-6 concentrations (pooled net difference: ?1.51 pg/mL; 95% CI: ?2.31, ?0.70) and lower, but nonsignificant, hs-CRP (pooled net change: ?0.58 mg/L; 95% CI: ?1.22, 0.05) and MDA (crossover trials pooled net difference: ?0.06 mol/L; 95% CI: ?0.19, 0.08).

Prompt patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms suggestive of lung cancer is crucial for early referral, diagnosis, and survivorship. However, individuals with potential lung cancer symptoms tend to delay help-seeking. This qualitative study explored perceived barriers to patient help-seeking and strategies to enhance help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms from the perspective of primary healthcare professionals. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 36 primary healthcare professionals. Data were collected via videoconferencing. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The following two themes were created from the data: (i) perceived barriers to patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms of concern and (ii) facilitating early patient presentation for signs and symptoms of concern. Some participants believed that the high cost of a general practitioner visit, long waiting times, and previous bad experiences with the healthcare system would deter patients from seeking help for symptoms of lung cancer. Perceived patient-related barriers to help-seeking related to the different emotions associated with a potential cancer diagnosis as well as stigma, embarrassment, and guilt felt by smokers. Sociodemographic factors such as drug use, homelessness, living in rural areas, and being male and older were also perceived to impede patient help-seeking. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer help-seeking also featured strongly. Participants recommended several strategies to enable patients to seek help for symptoms of concern including targeted educational campaigns focussing on symptoms (e.g., cough) rather than behaviours (e.g., smoking), accessible and free health services, and using patients support networks. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-related and healthcare system-related barriers to help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms include cost of healthcare, cancer fear, and various sociodemographic factors. Participants suggested that increased awareness and early patient help-seeking for symptoms of concern could be achieved through targeted patient education, national campaigns, the use of community support networks, and free and accessible targeted screening services.","output":"Primary healthcare professionals perspectives on patient help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed extraordinary demands from patients, providers, and health care systems.

Body weight was measured at home and self-reported. Results Patients (53% women, 45% disomic) were assessed, with a mean age of 28.18.7 years and body mass index (BMI) of 3711 kg/m2. Seventy percent lived in the Paris region (France) and were confined with their parents. The mean weight change was 1.03.3 kg. We compared patients showing weight loss (n=39, -3.32.9 kg) to patients showing weight gain (n=22, +2.31.5 kg): the BMI was lower (34.69.2 versus 40.49.5 kg/m2, p=0.02), PA increased (26% versus 5%, p=0.04), and EDs improved (51% versus 14%, p=0.005).

A data commons must establish legally interoperability between datasets to ensure researchers can aggregate and re-use them. This is usually achieved by establishing a shared governance structure. Unfortunately, governance often takes years to negotiate, and involves a trade-off between data inclusion and data availability. It can also be difficult for repositories to modify governance structures in response to changing scientific priorities, data sharing practices, or legal frameworks. This problem has been laid bare by the sudden shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a rapid and flexible strategy for scientific repositories to achieve legal interoperability: the policy-aware data lake. This strategy draws on technical concepts of modularity, metadata, and data lakes. Datasets are treated as independent modules, which can be subject to distinctive legal requirements. Each module must, however, be described using standard legal metadata. This allows legally compatible datasets to be rapidly combined and made available on a just-in-time basis to certain researchers for certain purposes. Global scientific repositories increasingly need such flexibility to manage scientific, organizational, and legal complexity, and to improve their responsiveness to global pandemics.","output":"Policy-Aware Data Lakes: A Flexible Approach to Achieve Legal Interoperability for Global Research Collaborations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of this writing, I encourage future academics to conduct further study on what sorts of music and movements are acceptable for women during birth, as this is a highly intriguing issue, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Conventional wisdom holds that public health policy should be made on the basis of empirical demonstrations, while little research has probed on how to safeguard the expected policy utility in the case of evidence shortage on novel contagious diseases. In particular, the fight against COVID-19 cannot succeed without public compliance as well as the support of people who have not tested positive. Based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19, by using a random effect estimator, fixed effect method, and hierarchical technique, we specified the efficiency of particular social distancing policies by contextualizing multiple factors. We found that adopting gathering restrictions decreased new case growth but were conditional on its interaction with population density, while mitigation effects constantly corresponded to policy magnitude in a given time;for which the effective patterns varied from three days to sixty days. Overall, policies encouraging social distancing exerted a positive effect on mitigating the first wave of COVID-19. Both the enforcing duration and public compliance constrained the expected impact of nonpharmaceutical intervention according to degrees of policy level. These findings suggest that, when evidence is incomplete, the effectiveness of public health crisis management depends on the combination of policy appropriateness and, accordingly, public compliance.","output":"Public Compliance Matters in Evidence-Based Public Health Policy: Evidence from Evaluating Social Distancing in the First Wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyse an initiative from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to facilitate the dissemination of global standards and guidelines through digital health packages, which can strengthen the capacity of countries to monitor the SDGs.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the perspectives and experiences of clinicians involved in institutional planning for resource limitation and/or patient care during the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used inductive thematic analysis of semistructured interviews conducted in April and May 2020 with a national group of clinicians (eg, intensivists, nephrologists, nurses) involved in institutional planning and/or clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Emergent themes describing clinicians experience providing care in settings of resource limitation. RESULTS: The 61 participants (mean [SD] age, 46 [11] years; 38 [63%] women) included in this study were practicing in 15 US states and were more heavily sampled from areas with the highest rates of COVID-19 infection at the time of interviews (ie, Seattle, New York City, New Orleans). Most participants were White individuals (39 [65%]), were attending physicians (45 [75%]), and were practicing in large academic centers (300 beds, 51 [85%]; academic centers, 46 [77%]). Three overlapping and interrelated themes emerged from qualitative analysis, as follows: (1) planning for crisis capacity, (2) adapting to resource limitation, and (3) multiple unprecedented barriers to care delivery. Clinician leaders worked within their institutions to plan a systematic approach for fair allocation of limited resources in crisis settings so that frontline clinicians would not have to make rationing decisions at the bedside. However, even before a declaration of crisis capacity, clinicians encountered varied and sometimes unanticipated forms of resource limitation that could compromise care, require that they make difficult allocation decisions, and contribute to moral distress. Furthermore, unprecedented challenges to caring for patients during the pandemic, including the need to limit in-person interactions, the rapid pace of change, and the dearth of scientific evidence, added to the challenges of caring for patients and communicating with families. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this qualitative study highlighted the complexity of providing high-quality care for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding the scope of institutional planning to address resource limitation challenges that can arise long before declarations of crisis capacity may help to support frontline clinicians, promote equity, and optimize care as the pandemic evolves.","output":"US Clinicians Experiences and Perspectives on Resource Limitation and Patient Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, endovascular aneurysm repair or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has become an acceptable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and other aortic pathologies such as the acute aortic syndromes (e.g., penetrating aortic ulcer, intramural hematoma, dissection). Available data suggest that endovascular repair is associated with lower perioperative 30-day all-cause mortality as well as a significant reduction in perioperative morbidity when compared to open surgery. Additionally, EVAR leads to decreased blood loss, eliminates the need for cross-clamping the aorta and has shorter recovery periods than traditional surgery. It is currently the preferred mode of treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms in a subset of patients who meet certain anatomic criteria conducive to endovascular repair. The main disadvantage of EVAR procedures is the high rate of post-procedural complications that often require secondary re-intervention. As a result, most authorities recommend lifelong imaging surveillance following repair. Available surveillance modalities include conventional radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, nuclear imaging and conventional angiography, with computed tomography currently considered to be the gold standard for surveillance by most experts. Following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the rate of complications is estimated to range between 16% and 30%. The complication rate is higher following thoracic EVAR (TEVAR) and is estimated to be as high as 38%. Common complications include both those related to the endograft device and systemic complications. Device-related complications include endoleaks, endograft migration or collapse, kinking and/or stenosis of an endograft limb and graft infection. Post-procedural systemic complications include end-organ ischemia, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and post-implantation syndrome. Secondary re-interventions are required in approximately 19% to 24% of cases following endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair respectively. Typically, most secondary reinterventions involve the use of percutaneous techniques such as placement of cuff extension devices, additional endograft components or stents, enhancement of endograft fixation, treatment of certain endoleaks using various embolization techniques and embolic agents and thrombolysis of occluded endograft components. Less commonly, surgical conversion and/or open surgical modification are required. In this article, we provide an overview of the most common complications that may occur following endovascular repair of thoracic and AAAs. We also summarize the current surveillance recommendations for detecting and evaluating these complications and discuss various current secondary re-intervention approaches that may typically be employed for treatment.","output":"Complications of endovascular aneurysm repair of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: evaluation and management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been severely detrimental to most firms. Preliminary estimates from Italy, which experienced the worst devastation from the virus during the early days of the pandemic, predicted that the country could lose at least $8.3 bn in the service and manufacturing sectors due to the coronavirus pandemic. Although there has been a series of ongoing government policies to mitigate the economic effect of the pandemic, we do not know to what extent these policies have been effective. Using two-period panel data (before and during the pandemic) on 419 Italian firms, this study examines the impact of government policies on firms using first difference estimation.

With the current pandemic situation, the testing and detection of this disease are becoming a challenge in many regions across the globe because of the insufficiency of the suitable testing infrastructure. The shortage of kits to test COVID-19 has led to another crisis owing to worldwide supply-demand mismatch, and thereby, widen up a new research area that deals with the detection of COVID-19 without the test kit. In this paper, we investigate medical images, mostly chest X-ray images and thorax computed tomography (CT) scans to identify the attack of COVID-19. In countries, where the number of medical experts is lesser than the expected as recommended by WHO, this computer-aided system can be useful as it requires minimal human intervention.

Therefore, we created the International Registry of COVID infection in glomerulonephritis (IRoc-GN) and identified 40 patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 followed in centers in North America and Europe. Detailed information on glomerulonephritis diagnosis, kidney parameters, and baseline immunosuppression prior to infection were recorded, as well as clinical presentation, laboratory values, treatment, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19. This cohort was compared to 80 COVID-positive control cases from the general population without glomerulonephritis matched for the time of infection. The majority (70%) of the patients with glomerulonephritis and all the controls were hospitalized. Patients with glomerulonephritis had significantly higher mortality (15% vs. 5%, respectively) and acute kidney injury (39% vs. 14%) than controls, while the need for kidney replacement therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. Receiving immunosuppression or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors at presentation did not increase the risk of death or acute kidney injury in the glomerulonephritis cohort. In the cohort with glomerulonephritis, lower serum albumin at presentation and shorter duration of glomerular disease were associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and need for kidney replacement therapy. No differences in outcomes occurred between patients with primary glomerulonephritis versus glomerulonephritis associated with a systemic autoimmune disease (lupus or vasculitis). Thus, due to the higher mortality and risk of acute kidney injury than in the general population without glomerulonephritis, patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 should be carefully monitored, especially when they present with low serum albumin levels.","output":"Results from the IRoc-GN international registry of patients with COVID-19 and glomerular disease suggest close monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigated whether the CHA2DS2-VASc score could be used to estimate the need for hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), the length of stay in the ICU, and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to propose a practical approach for the virtual management of these patients. METHODS: To do this, we conducted a literature search, including 32 articles relevant to the topic treated in this review. RESULTS: The most challenging step in telemedicine applied to practical neurology remains the clinical assessment, but through a careful headache history and a recently proposed entirely virtual neurological assessment, this hitch can be easily overcome. Electronic diary compilations and virtual administration of disability-measuring scales, conversely, are the key features of effective long-term follow-up although we do not have apps that met the criteria of scientific reliability. Furthermore, tele-rehabilitation seems to be effective and has demonstrated to be a solution to alternatively treat chronic patients at home, and can be considered part of the remote management of headache patients. Moreover, virtual management of headaches finds an application in specific communities of patients, as pediatric patients and for rural communities of low- and middle-income countries suffer from health disparities, with inadequate resources and knowledge gaps.

In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation was emphasized by many respondents. CONCLUSION: The currently low prevalence of COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience. Therefore, the presented results have to be interpreted with caution and mostly as hypothetical treatment considerations. It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.","output":"COVID-19: Behandlungsstrategien der deutschsprachigen Kinderrheumatologen: Ergebnisse einer Online-Umfrage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overnight, the Covid-19 pandemic brought a need to use technology with which vets might not previously have grappled - most notably telemedicine.

A unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection is the occurrence of an autoinfection cycle which permits persistence of the parasite years after the normal host has left an endemic area. In this cycle, the rhabditiform larvae in the duodenojujenal portion of the small intestine transform directly into filariform (infective) larvae. The filariform larvae without leaving the body can reinfect the patient by penetrating the intestinal mucosa. This distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides, to persist and replicate within the host for decades, produces minimal or no symptoms. Immunocompromised patients may develop a fulminant illness due to a unique process in the life cycle of Strongyloides in which there are dramatic increases in the number of filariform larvae. In the hyperinfection syndrome, massive numbers of larvae migrate through the intestinal mucosa and into the lungs (the usual migration pattern) and disseminate to involve other organ systems not ordinarily a part of the life cycle of the parasite. Larvae may be found in the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and almost any other organ.","output":"Helminth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often present with various degrees of liver injury Thus, patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (LD) may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19, but this has not yet been well characterized Aim: To examine the impact of pre-existing LD on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Johns Hopkins Health System between February 1, 2020, and July 1, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19 Identified patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of pre-existing LD The LD group consisted of patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing liver disease at the time of diagnosis of COVID-19 We studied outcomes, including the need for hemodialysis or vasopressor support, hospital length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality We described categorical data as percentages, and continuous data as mean with standard error (SD) We used Pearson's chi-squared tests and analysis of variance to compare variables between the patients with and without LD Results: In a study of 2,293 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, 129 (17 8%) patients had pre-existing LD Among them, 32 (24 8%) patients had cirrhosis;18 (14 0%) had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;20 (15 5%) had chronic hepatitis C;5 (3 87%) had chronic hepatitis B, and 5 (3 87%) were liver transplant recipients Patients with LD were more often black (41 9%) compared to patients with no preexisting LD (35 1%, p = 0 029) LD patients had substantially higher prevalence of comorbidities, including hypertension (79 9% vs 61%, p &lt; 0 001), diabetes (27 9% vs 15 6%, p &lt; 0 001), chronic pulmonary disease (31 0% vs 18 4%, p &lt; 0 0001), and anemia (43 4% vs 22%, p &lt; 0 001) Those with LD required hemodialysis more often (10% vs 4 4%, p = 0 015) There was no difference in need for vasopressor support (20 0% vs 18 8%, p = 0 12) The hospital LOS was similar between the groups (9 5 vs 9 6 days) There was no difference in mortality between the two groups (10 0% vs 14 6%, p = 0 14) Conclusion: Patients with pre-existing LD and COVID-19 infection were more likely black, have underlying comorbidities and require hemodialysis However, they had similar hospital LOS and mortality as those without LD These findings have important implications for patients with LD but require further validation","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without pre-existing chronic liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Current salt intake in Malaysia is high. The existing national salt reduction policy has faced slow progress and does not yet include measures to address the out of home sector. Dishes consumed in the out of home sector are a known leading contributor to daily salt intake. This study aims to develop a salt reduction strategy, tailored to the out of home sector in Malaysia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a qualitative analysis of stakeholder views towards salt reduction. Participants will be recruited from five zones of Malaysia (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern regions and East Malaysia), including policy-makers, non-governmental organisations, food industries, school canteen operators, street food vendors and consumers, to participate in focus group discussions or in-depth interviews. Interviews will be transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Barriers will be identified and used to develop a tailored salt reduction strategy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Research Ethics Committee (UKM PPI/1118/JEP-2020C524), the Malaysian National Medical Research Ethics Committee (NMRR-20-1387-55481 (IIR)) and Queen Mary University of London Research Ethics Committee (QMERC2020/37). Results will be presented orally and in report form and made available to the relevant ministries for example, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Trade to encourage adoption of strategy as policy. The findings of this study will be disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and webinars.","output":"Developing a policy to reduce the salt content of food consumed outside the home in Malaysia: protocol of a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of SARS-CoV-2 detection tests requested to the laboratories has dramatically increased together with an urgent need to release reliable responses in a very short time. The two options taken into consideration and analyzed in the current study were the point-of-care test (POCT) based on the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and the Antigen (Ag) rapid test. The POCT-NAAT-based assay was compared with a rapid antigen test of nasopharyngeal swab samples. If the specimen tested positive, it was followed by viral load quantification and by the functional assessment of the residual infectivity. When the initial cycle threshold (Ct) was below 20 (100%), and in the range of 20C25 (92%) and of 25C30 (88%), a great concordance between the POCT-NAAT and the Ag test was observed. Moreover, the positivity of the antigen test was well correlated to a successful infection in vitro (78%), with greater concordance when the initial Ct below 20 or above 35 (100%) and in the range 20C25 (83%). Our findings showed that most of the swabs which tested positive using the antigen test were able to infect the cells in vitro, suggesting that probably only these samples hold residual infectivity and therefore an increased risk of virus transmission at the moment of being tested.

The innate immune systems of these immensely abundant, anciently diverged mammals remain insufficiently characterized. While bat genomes contain many endogenous retroviral elements indicative of past exogenous infections, little is known about restrictions to extant retroviruses. Here, we describe a major postentry restriction in cells of the yinpterochiropteran bat Pteropus alecto Primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, SIVmac) were potently blocked at early life cycle steps, with up to 1,000-fold decreases in infectivity. The block was specific, because nonprimate lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus were unimpaired, as were foamy retroviruses. Interspecies heterokaryons demonstrated a dominant block consistent with restriction of incoming viruses. Several features suggested potential TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5) or myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) protein restriction, including postentry action, cyclosporine sensitivity, and reversal by capsid cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop mutations. Viral nuclear import was significantly reduced, and this deficit was substantially rescued by cyclosporine treatment. However, saturation with HIV-1 virus-like particles did not relieve the restriction at all. P. alecto TRIM5 was inactive against HIV-1 although it blocked the gammaretrovirus N-tropic murine leukemia virus. Despite major divergence in a critical N-terminal motif required for human MX2 activity, P. alecto MX2 had anti-HIV activity. However, this did not quantitatively account for the restriction and was independent of and synergistic with an additional CypA-dependent restriction. These results reveal a novel, specific restriction to primate lentiviruses in the Pteropodidae and advance understanding of bat innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic suggests that bat innate immune systems are insufficiently characterized relative to the medical importance of these animals. Retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, can be severe pathogens when they cross species barriers, and bat restrictions corresponding to retroviruses are comparatively unstudied. Here, we compared the abilities of retroviruses from three genera (Lentivirus, Gammaretrovirus, and Spumavirus) to infect cells of the large fruit-eating bat P. alecto and other mammals. We identified a major, specific postentry restriction to primate lentiviruses. HIV-1 and SIVmac are potently blocked at early life cycle steps, but nonprimate lentiviruses and foamy retroviruses are entirely unrestricted. Despite acting postentry and in a CypA-dependent manner with features reminiscent of antiretroviral factors from other mammals, this restriction was not saturable with virus-like particles and was independent of P. alecto TRIM5, TRIM21, TRIM22, TRIM34, and MX2. These results identify a novel restriction and highlight cyclophilin-capsid interactions as ancient species-specific determinants of retroviral infection.","output":"A Potent Postentry Restriction to Primate Lentiviruses in a Yinpterochiropteran Bat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry encounter substantial risks and challenges in its evolution towards sustainable development. International businesses, multinational AEC organisations, technical professionals, project and portfolio management organisations face global connectivity challenges between business units, especially during the outbreak of novel coronavirus pandemic, to manage construction megaprojects (CMPs). That raises the need to manage global connectivity as a main strategic goal of global organisations. This paper aims to investigate barriers to integrating lean construction (LC) practices and integrated project delivery (IPD) on CMPs towards the global integrated delivery (GID) transformative initiatives and develop future of work (FOW) global initiatives in contemporary multinational AEC organisations. Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage quantitative and qualitative research approach is adopted. The qualitative research methodology consists of a literature review to appraise barriers to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs. Barriers are arranged into six-factor clusters (FCs), with a conceptualisation of LeanIPD&GID, GID strategy placements and FOW global initiatives with multiple validations. This analysis also involved semi-structured interviews and focus group techniques. Stage two consisted of an empirical questionnaire survey that shaped the foundation of analysis and findings of 230 respondents from 23 countries with extensive cosmopolitan experience in the construction of megaprojects. The survey examined a set of 28 barriers to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs resulting from a detailed analysis of extant literature after validation. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were exploited for data analysis, percentage scoring analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and eigenvalues were used to elaborate on clustered factors. Findings: The research conceptualised LeanIPD&GID principles and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives and FOW global initiatives. It concluded that the most significant barriers to integration of LeanIPD&GID on CMPs are lack of mandatory building information modelling (BIM) and LC industry standards and regulations by governments, lack of involvement and support of governments, high costs of BIM software licenses, resistance of industry to change from traditional working practices and high initial investment in staff training costs of BIM. PCA revealed the most significant FCs are education and knowledge-related barriers, project objectives-related barriers and attitude-related barriers. Awareness of BIM in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is higher than LC and LC awareness is higher than IPD knowledge. Whilst BIM adoption in the MENA region is higher than LC;the second is still taking its first steps, whilst IPD has little implementation. LeanBIM is slightly integrated, whilst LeanIPD integration is almost not present. Originality/value: The research findings, conclusion and recommendation and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs. This will allow project key stakeholders to place emphasis on tackling LeanIPD&GID barriers identified in this research and commence GID strategies. The study has provided effective practical strategies for enhancing the integration of LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives on CMPs. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Barriers to integrating lean construction and integrated project delivery (IPD) on construction megaprojects towards the global integrated delivery (GID) in multinational organisations: lean IPD&GID transformative initiatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients commonly present with neurological signs of central nervous system (CNS)(1C3) and/or peripheral nervous system dysfunction(4). However, which neural cells are permissive to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been controversial. Here, we show that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are selectively permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a DA neuron inflammatory and cellular senescence response. A high-throughput screen in hPSC-derived DA neurons identified several FDA approved drugs, including riluzole, metformin, and imatinib, that can rescue the cellular senescence phenotype and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA-seq analysis of human ventral midbrain tissue from COVID-19 patients, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy samples, confirmed the induction of an inflammatory and cellular senescence signature and identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Our findings demonstrate that hPSC-derived DA neurons can serve as a disease model to study neuronal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and to identify candidate neuroprotective drugs for COVID-19 patients. The susceptibility of hPSC-derived DA neurons to SARS-CoV-2 and the observed inflammatory and senescence transcriptional responses suggest the need for careful, long-term monitoring of neurological problems in COVID-19 patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Causes Dopaminergic Neuron Senescence"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/70.md","filePath":"drive/70.md"}'),V={name:"drive/70.md"},M=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,M as default};
