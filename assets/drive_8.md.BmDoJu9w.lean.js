The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. Considering different starting times of infection, mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Based on the target cell limited model, the within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the broad values of human influenza infection. The best model to fit the data was including immune cell response, which suggests a slow immune response peaking between 5 to 10 days post-onset of symptoms. The model with the eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, all models predict that SARS-CoV-2 may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and viral load could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work. These models can serve for future evaluation of control theoretical approaches to tailor new potential drugs against COVID-19.","output":"In-host Mathematical Modelling of COVID-19 in Humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conformational equilibria are at the heart of drug design, yet their energetic description is often hampered by the insufficient accuracy of low-cost methods.

RESULTS: Data from 4375 SLE survey respondents (95.9% women, median age: 45 (IQR: 36C54) years, 70.7% Caucasians) from 35 European countries were analysed. The median age at SLE diagnosis was 30 years (IQR: 22C40) and the median diagnosis delay was 2 years (IQR: 0C6). The most commonly affected organ-systems included the joints (81.8%) and skin (59.4%), with renal involvement in 30%. Another diagnosis was given before that of SLE in 45.0%, including psychological/mental disorders in 9.1% and fibromyalgia in 5.9%. The median number of symptoms reported was 9 (IQR: 6C11) out of 21, with fatigue most common (85.3%) and most bothersome. The median number of SLE-related medications was 5 (IQR: 3C7), including antimalarials (75%), oral glucocorticoids (52.4%), immunosuppressants (39.8%) and biologics (10.9%).

Effective anticoagulation therapy may play a dominant role in the management of severe COVID-19 cases. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man with a 6-day history of fever up to 38.5C, dyspnea, cough, and fatigue was diagnosed with COVID-19. He had a past medical history significant for hypertension and coronary artery bypass grafting. Two days after hospital admission, the patient developed acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). He received treatment including antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, vasopressors, prone positioning, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin at a prophylactic dose. After a 15-day ICU stay, the patient was hemodynamically stable but still hypoxemic; a transthoracic echocardiogram at that time, followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram for better evaluation, revealed the presence of a right atrium thrombus without signs of acute right ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, we decided to treat him with conventional anticoagulation under close monitoring for signs of hemodynamic deterioration; thus, the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin was replaced by therapeutic dosing, which was a key component of the patients successful outcome. Over the next few days he showed significant clinical improvement. The follow-up transesophageal echo-cardiogram 3 weeks after effective therapeutic anticoagulation revealed no signs of right heart thrombus. CONCLUSIONS: The presented COVID-19 case, one of the first reported cases with evidence of right heart thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography, highlights the central role of diagnostic imaging strategies and the importance of adequate anticoagulation therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 cases in the ICU.","output":"A Severe COVID-19 Case Complicated by Right Atrium Thrombus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lessons from Florence Nightingale are just as relevant today as they were more than 150 years ago.

We assembled a retrospective cohort from a Veterans Affairs (VA) national COVID-19 shared data repository, collected between February and August 2020. A case was defined as a woman veteran who tested positive for SARS-COV-2, and a control as a woman veteran who tested negative. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model to examine the distribution of time to death and the effects of baseline predictors on mortality risk. We used generalized linear models to examine 60-day cardiovascular disease outcomes. Covariates studied included age, body mass index (BMI), and active smoking status at index, and pre-existing conditions of diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of treatment with antiplatelet or anti-thrombotic drug at any time in the 2 years prior to the index date.

We used 2 ACE-resistant bradykinin analogues to activate the B2 receptors. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to analyze the peptides cleaved by ACE on cell monolayers and found that Ang 1-9 was hydrolyzed 18x slower than Ang I and &30% slower than Ang 1-7. Ang 1-7 was cleaved to Ang 1-5. Although micromol/L concentrations of slowly cleaved substrates Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-9 inhibit ACE, they resensitize the desensitized B2GFP receptors in nmol/L concentration, independent of ACE inhibition. This is reflected by release of arachidonic acid through a mechanism involving cross-talk between ACE and B2 receptors. When ACE was not expressed, the Ang 1-9, Ang 1-7 peptides were inactive. Inhibitors of protein kinase C-alpha, phosphatases and Tyr-kinase blocked this resensitization activity, but not basal B2 activation by bradykinin. Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 enhance bradykinin activity, probably by acting as endogenous allosteric modifiers of the ACE and B2 receptor complex. Consequently, when ACE inhibitors block conversion of Ang I, other enzymes can still release Ang I metabolites to enhance the efficacy of ACE inhibitors.","output":"Hydrolysis of angiotensin peptides by human angiotensin I-converting enzyme and the resensitization of B2 kinin receptors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of upper tract infection / ARI in primary schools is 15% in 2019.

This simple statement belies the complexity of determining the adequate number of beds for a given community, a number dependent on a variety of factors including the epidemiology of childrens mental illness, social determinants of health, the functioning of other mental health services, and the availability of community supports. The aim of this session is to provide a detailed background of the scope of our inpatient access problem and its consequences. Methods: Available state and national data will be reviewed and synthesized to describe the availability and distribution of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry hospital beds. The impact of the limitation in beds on children and adolescents and families as well as healthcare systems will be described. The needs of special populations and the clinical profiles of patients most likely to experience prolonged boarding will be reviewed.

In the present study, we aimed to screen for the neuropsychiatric signs detected <1 to >6 months after infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to determine whether vaccination has an effect on them. METHODS An online survey was conducted among participants who had been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical signs and durations of neuropsychiatric complaints and their correlations to sex, age, severity of COVID-19 signs, and vaccination status were screened. RESULTS A total of 2218 individuals, including 1358 females and 860 males, with an age range of 12-70 years, submitted their responses. The respondents experienced cognitive dysfunction, mood alteration, depression, tinnitus, sleep disorders, and loss of taste and smell, with prevalence rates ranging from 18.9% (tinnitus) to 63.9% (loss of taste and smell). Of the respondents, 2.2-7.7% of confirmed the persistence of symptoms for >6 months. Tinnitus was the least common complaint, and only 2.2% of the study participants had tinnitus for >6 months. Meanwhile, mood alteration persisted for >6 months in 7.6% of the study participants. More respondents who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine showed persistent symptoms than those in the other groups. Disease severity and female sex were identified as potential determinants of the development and persistency of such symptoms. CONCLUSION Post-COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in considerable percentages of the study participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, persisting for >6 months in up to 7.6% of the participants.","output":"Neuropsychiatric symptoms in post COVID-19 long haulers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we addressed the question whether cholesterol is important for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, in the initiation of an infection. We found that cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane by methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) significantly impaired the efficiency of TGEV infection. Infectivity was also reduced after depleting cholesterol from the viral envelope. This finding is surprising because coronaviruses bud from a pre-Golgi compartment which is expected to be low in cholesterol compared to the plasma membrane. Addition of exogenous cholesterol resulted in a restoration of the infectivity confirming our conclusion that efficient TGEV infection requires cholesterol in both the viral and the cellular membranes.

Evidence for the utility of chest radiographs (CXRs) in this population is less robust. Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXRs compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHOD: Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also measured. RESULTS: Of 582 patients (51 +/- 20 years), 143/582 (24.6 %) had a positive RT-PCR. The absolute concordance between the two assessors was 71.1 % (414/582) with a Fleiss-Cohen-weighted Cohen's &#954; of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). A patient with a positive CXR had an 88 % (95 % CI 80-96 %) probability of having a positive RT-PCR during a period of high incidence, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Using a structured approach, a positive CXR had a high likelihood of predicting a positive RT-PCR, with good interrater reliability.

While the role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood, precise data on the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is required to determine the risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces. METHODS: This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-CoV-2, suspended in a standard ASTM E2197 matrix, on several common surface types. All experiments were carried out in the dark, to negate any effects of UV light. Inoculated surfaces were incubated at 20 C, 30 C and 40 C and sampled at various time points. RESULTS: Survival rates of SARS-CoV-2 were determined at different temperatures and D-values, Z-values and half-life were calculated. We obtained half lives of between 1.7 and 2.7 days at 20 C, reducing to a few hours when temperature was elevated to 40 C. With initial viral loads broadly equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients, viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 C from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel and both paper and polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less than 24 h at 40 C on some surfaces. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible.

There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects, but it is hoped that telemedicine can provide a viable alternative. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand what type of health care services were being deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the role played by telemedicine to fill in care gaps, and changes in attitudes toward telemedicine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. Our main outcomes were use of telemedicine and reports of care deferral during the shutdown. RESULTS: Deferred care was widespread48% (n=812) of respondents deferred carebut it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concerns about negative health effects. In total, 30.2% (n=242) of those who delayed care were concerned about health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic; it was seen as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by respondents who were over 65 years of age, female, and college educated. Mental health services stood out for having high levels of deferred care. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary health system shutdowns will give rise to deferred care. However, much of the deferrals will be for preventive services. The effect of this on patient health can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and delivering other services through telemedicine. Having telemedicine as an option is particularly crucial for mental health services.","output":"Consumer Reported Care Deferrals Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the Role and Potential of Telemedicine: Cross-Sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The affinity of an antibody for its antigen is primarily determined by the specific sequence and structural arrangement of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Recent evidence, however, points toward a nontrivial relation between the CDR and distal sites: variations in the binding strengths have been observed upon mutating residues separated from the paratope by several nanometers, thus suggesting the existence of a communication network within antibodies, whose extension and relevance might be deeper than insofar expected. In this work, we test this hypothesis by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the IgG4 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab, an approved drug that targets the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The molecule is simulated in both the apo and holo states, totalling 4 s of MD trajectory. The analysis of these simulations shows that the bound antibody explores a restricted range of conformations with respect to the apo one, and that the global conformation of the molecule correlates with that of the CDR. These results support the hypothesis that pembrolizumab featues a multi-scale hierarchy of intertwined global and local conformational changes.

Although the prevalence of norovirus infection is known to have increased in various countries, in India there are few reports pertaining to the norovirus disease burden. We investigated the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of noroviruses in children seeking health care at two hospitals in Kolkata, Eastern India. Faecal specimens were collected between January 2018 and December 2019 from 2812 children under 5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis. Noroviruses were detected in 6.04% (170/2812) of the samples, and 12.9% (22/170) of these were cases of coinfection with rotavirus. Among children (5 years), a higher infection rate (8.2%, n = 94/1152) was observed in the 6 to 12 month age group. GII.4 Sydney 2012 was the dominant norovirus capsid genotype (n = 75/90, 83.3%), followed by GII.3 (n = 10/90, 11.1%). Other capsid types GII.13 (n = 4/90, 4.4%) and GII.17 (n = 1/90; 1.1%) were also detected at low frequency. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the GII.P16 polymerase of strains in this region clustered with those of the phylogenetically distinct monophyletic clade of GII.P16 strains, whose members have been circulating worldwide since 2014. Inter-genotypic norovirus recombinants such as GII.P16-GII.3 (n = 10) and GII.P16-GII.13 (n = 4) were also observed among the circulating strains.

Rodents are important reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens, and rodent population dynamics affect the infection dynamics of rodent-borne diseases, such as diseases caused by hantaviruses. However, the role of rodent population dynamics in determining the infection dynamics of rodent-associated tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria, have gained limited attention in Northern Europe, despite the multiannual abundance fluctuations, the so-called vole cycles, that characterise rodent population dynamics in the region. Here, we quantify the associations between rodent abundance and LB human cases and Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) infections by using two time series (25-year and 9-year) in Finland. Both bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance as well as LB and PUUV infection incidence in humans showed approximately 3-year cycles. Without vector transmitted PUUV infections followed the bank vole host abundance fluctuations with two-month time lag, whereas tick-transmitted LB was associated with bank vole abundance ca. 12 and 24 months earlier. However, the strength of association between LB incidence and bank vole abundance ca. 12 months before varied over the study years. This study highlights that the human risk to acquire rodent-borne pathogens, as well as rodent-associated tick-borne pathogens is associated with the vole cycles in Northern Fennoscandia, yet with complex time lags.","output":"Rodent host population dynamics drive zoonotic Lyme Borreliosis and Orthohantavirus infections in humans in Northern Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lombardy was violently hit by Covid-19 between the end of February and the beginning of March 2020 On 09 05 2020 there were 81225 total registered Covid-19+ cases (8051 / million inhabitants) with 14924 deaths (1479 deaths / million inhabitants) The province of Cremona presented a higher number of Covid-19+ cases and a worse relative mortality than the already high regional average Patients on regular hemodialysis treatment present a high risk of infection due to the co-pathologies present, while healthcare workers may represent a risk for themselves and for the patients, due to the treatment environment and the close contact with them All patients and healthcare workers of the Dialysis Center in Crema were evaluated (oro-pharyngeal swab for viral RNA research, qualitative anti-Covid-19 antibodies, quantitative IgG antibodies, co-pathologies), regardless of the symptomatology, over a 60-day period Hemodialysis patients have a risk of infection that is 12 7 times that of the local population, while healthcare workers outperform the patients for Covid-positivity (30 3% vs 21 6%) Lethality in infected patients is high (31% of Covid-19+ subjects), while it is zero among healthcare professionals The antibody response (qualitative and quantitative) in Covid-19+ patients is adequate, when compared to that of Covid-19+ healthcare staff In our Center, the most critical phase lasted about 45 days but, thanks to the measures taken, it was possible to make the dialysis area Covid-free, as it remains after 128 days","output":"[The peak of the Coronavirus emergency and hemodialysis patients: the experience of the Dialysis Center in Crema]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the developing COVID\\\\19 pandemic, patients with inherited anaemias require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to usual treatment schedules.

Biological monitoring data collected at Kesterson from 1989 to 1994 were used to parameterize the initial model.

METHODS Four cecally-cannulated horses were utilized to determine the optimal dose of liposomal-curcumin (LIPC) on reducing Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex (SBEC), Escherichia coli K-12, Escherichia coli general, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in the equine hindgut without adversely affecting cecal characteristics. In the first study cecal fluid was collected from each horse and composited for an in vitro, 24 h batch culture to examine LIPC at four different dosages (15, 20, 25, and 30 g) in a completely randomized design. A subsequent in vivo 4  4 Latin square design study was conducted to evaluate no LIPC (control, CON) or LIPC dosed at 15, 25, and 35 g per day (dosages determined from in vitro results) for 9 days on the efficacy of LIPC on selected bacterial strains, pH, and volatile fatty acids. Each period was 14 days with 9 d for acclimation and 5 d withdrawal period. RESULTS In the in vitro study dosage had no effect (P  0.42) on Clostridium strains, but as the dose increased SBEC concentrations increased (P = 0.001). Concentrations of the E. coli strain varied with dose. In vivo, LIPC's antimicrobial properties, at 15 g, significantly decreased (P = 0.02) SBEC when compared to 25 and 35 g dosages. C. perfringens decreased linearly (P = 0.03) as LIPC dose increased. Butyrate decreased linearly (P = 0.01) as LIPC dose increased.

Trypsin activation is necessary for rotavirus to mediate cell-cell fusion. The extent of fusion is relative to the amount of virus used, and maximum fusion occurs between pHs 6.5 and 7.5. Fusion does not require virus-induced protein synthesis, as virus from both an empty capsid preparation and from an EDTA-treated preparation, which is noninfectious, can induce fusion.

METHODS: We developed a simple and rapid protocol for isolating SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens using VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, a cell line that is highly susceptible to the virus. We also investigated a correlation between isolation of SARS-CoV-2 and viral load detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using N2 primer/probe set that has been developed for testing of COVID-19 in Japan. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 isolation protocol did not require blind passage of inoculated cells and yielded the results of viral isolation within 7 days after inoculation. Specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) values of <20.2, determined by rRT-PCR, were predicted to be isolation-positive. On the other hand, 6.9% of specimens with Ct values >35 were virus isolation-positive, indicating that low viral loads (high Ct values) in upper respiratory specimens do not always indicate no risk of containing transmissible virus.

Greater compassionate love predicted greater personal accomplishment and compassion satisfaction for all first responders (||s  .30, ps < .001); for traditional first responders only, greater self-compassion predicted greater personal accomplishment and compassion satisfaction (role x self-compassion; ||s  .16, ps < .05). Emotional support first responders reported less emotional exhaustion and greater resilience than traditional first responders (||s  .21, ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Self-compassion and compassionate love each play important roles in promoting mental health among first responders. Programs designed to increase compassion could be beneficial in this population.

In a similar manner to an epidemic, it spreads between humans via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. OBJECTIVE: A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation on responding to the infodemic related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was held, entirely online, to crowdsource suggested actions for a framework for infodemic management. METHODS: A group of policy makers, public health professionals, researchers, students, and other concerned stakeholders was joined by representatives of the media, social media platforms, various private sector organizations, and civil society to suggest and discuss actions for all parts of society, and multiple related professional and scientific disciplines, methods, and technologies. A total of 594 ideas for actions were crowdsourced online during the discussions and consolidated into suggestions for an infodemic management framework. RESULTS: The analysis team distilled the suggestions into a set of 50 proposed actions for a framework for managing infodemics in health emergencies. The consultation revealed six policy implications to consider. First, interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence, and must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions on how to protect themselves and their communities in a health emergency. Second, knowledge should be translated into actionable behavior-change messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to all individuals in all parts of all societies. Third, governments should reach out to key communities to ensure their concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and messages to address the audiences they represent. Fourth, to strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact, strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors, including but not limited to the social media and technology sectors, academia, and civil society. Fifth, health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by reliable information that helps them understand the circulating narratives and changes in the flow of information, questions, and misinformation in communities. Sixth, following experiences to date in responding to the COVID-19 infodemic and the lessons from other disease outbreaks, infodemic management approaches should be further developed to support preparedness and response, and to inform risk mitigation, and be enhanced through data science and sociobehavioral and other research. CONCLUSIONS: The first version of this framework proposes five action areas in which WHO Member States and actors within society can apply, according to their mandate, an infodemic management approach adapted to national contexts and practices. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related infodemic require swift, regular, systematic, and coordinated action from multiple sectors of society and government. It remains crucial that we promote trusted information and fight misinformation, thereby helping save lives.","output":"Framework for Managing the COVID-19 Infodemic: Methods and Results of an Online, Crowdsourced WHO Technical Consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the end of June 2021, the state of Israel, where ~60% of the population is vaccinated with an mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, has an increase in the daily morbidity. This increase may be a result of different events: a temporal decline of the vaccine's efficacy; Lower efficacy of the vaccine against the current Delta ( (B.1.617.2) variant (which is now the dominant strain in Israel); A result of lack of social restrictions, a highly contagious variant, or any combination of the above. We found, by using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent {aggregate} data from Israel, that this new surge of cases is partiality due to a decline in the shielding of those who were vaccinated about six months ago. Also, we found a decrease in the vaccine's efficacy against severe morbidity for the early elderly population compared to the rest of the vaccinated population. These results, which are consistent with recent studies, emphasize the high ability of the model in evaluating the time- and age-dependent efficacy of the vaccine for different age groups and enables to predict the spread of the pandemic as a function of such efficacy.","output":"Using a physical model and aggregate data from Israel to estimate the current (July 2021 ) efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The external ear represents a site with high ultraviolet exposure and thin skin overlying cartilage.

Seven of thirty-two patients (22%) who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy had positive nodes. Twenty (33%) patients had recurrence including 6 patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and 5 patients with positive SLNs. Three of 10 patients (30%) treated with Mohs surgery had local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS The overall local and systemic recurrences are similar to those previously reported. There is a higher recurrence rate than expected in patients with a negative SLN and a high local recurrence rate after Mohs surgery. Our data suggest that SLN evaluation may be less accurate in ear melanomas and that Mohs surgery may be associated with a relatively high local recurrence rate.","output":"Management of external ear melanoma: the same or something different?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In critically ill children, severely altered pharmacokinetics may result in subtherapeutic ?-lactam antibiotic concentrations when standard pediatric dosing regimens are applied. However, it remains unclear how to recognize patients most at risk for suboptimal exposure and their outcome. This study aimed to: 1) describe target attainment for ?-lactam antibiotics in critically ill children, 2) identify risk factors for suboptimal exposure, and 3) study the association between target nonattainment and clinical outcome. DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of the \\"Antibiotic Dosing in Pediatric Intensive Care\\" study (NCT02456974, 2012-2019). Steady-state trough plasma concentrations were classified as therapeutic if greater than or equal to the minimum inhibitory concentration of the (suspected) pathogen. Factors associated with subtherapeutic concentrations and clinical outcome were identified by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: The pediatric and cardiac surgery ICU of a Belgian tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients (aged 1 mo to 15 yr) treated intravenously with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-two trough concentrations were obtained from 157 patients (median age, 1.25 yr; interquartile range, 0.4-4.2 yr). Subtherapeutic concentrations were measured in 39 of 60 (65%), 43 of 48 (90%), and 35 of 49 (71%) of patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem, respectively. Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 54% increase in odds for each sd increase in value, 95% CI, 0.287-0.736; p = 0.001) and the absence of vasopressor treatment (2.8-fold greater odds, 95% CI, 1.079-7.253; p = 0.034) were independently associated with target nonattainment. We failed to identify an association between antibiotic concentrations and clinical failure. CONCLUSIONS: Subtherapeutic ?-lactam concentrations are common in critically ill children and correlate with renal function. eGFR equations may be helpful in identifying patients who may require higher dosing.

METHODS: All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases. Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU. The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P < 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values < 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925. The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted.

Major causes of under-5 child deaths in South Africa (SA) are well recognised, and child mortality rates are falling. The focus of child health is therefore shifting from survival to disease prevention and thriving, but local data on the non-fatal disease burden are limited. Furthermore, COVID-19 has affected children's health and wellbeing, both directly and indirectly. Objectives. To describe the pattern of disease on admission of children at different levels of care, and assess whether this has been affected by COVID-19. Methods. Retrospective reviews of children's admission and discharge registers were conducted for all general hospitals in iLembe and uMgungundlovu districts in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA, from January 2018 to September 2020. The Global Burden of Disease framework was adapted to create a data capture sheet with four broad diagnostic categories and 37 specific cause categories. Monthly admission numbers were recorded per cause category, and basic descriptive analysis was completed in Microsoft Excel. Results. Overall, 36 288 admissions were recorded across 18 hospital wards, 32.0% at district, 49.8% at regional and 18.2% at tertiary level. Communicable diseases, perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies (CPNs) accounted for 37.4% of admissions, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 43.5% and injuries for 17.1%. The distribution of broad diagnostic categories varied across levels of care, with CPNs being more common at district level and NCDs more common at regional and tertiary levels. Unintentional injuries represented the most common cause category (16.6%), ahead of lower respiratory tract infections (16.1%), neurological conditions (13.6%) and diarrhoeal disease (8.4%). The start of the local COVID-19 outbreak coincided with a 43.1% decline in the mean number of monthly admissions. Admissions due to neonatal conditions and intentional injuries remained constant during the COVID-19 outbreak, while those due to other disease groups (particularly respiratory infections) declined. Conclusions. Our study confirms previous concerns around a high burden of childhood injuries in our context. Continued efforts are needed to prevent and treat traditional neonatal and childhood illnesses. Concurrently, the management of NCDs should be prioritised, and evidence-based strategies are sorely needed to address the high injury burden in SA.","output":"Patterns of disease on admission to children's wards and changes during a COVID-19 outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to critically reconstruct the main methods and perspectives of audiovisual representation - expressed through the peculiar dynamics of digital communication - which emerged during the world crisis triggered by the Covid-19 emergency.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the current situation of polio in Ethiopia. METHOD: Relevant scientific articles on Polio were searched from different data bases and websites. RESULTS: The first wild poliovirus in Ethiopia was detected in 1999, followed by detection of few cases in 2000 and 2001. No wild poliovirus was detected in Ethiopia for the next 3 years (2001C2003). However, the disease resurged again in the country between 2004 and 2008 due to challenge to provide sufficient oral poliovirus vaccine coverage, migration and cross border economic activities and lack of good acute flaccid paralysis surveillance. After almost 5 years with no wild polio virus, Ethiopia again affected by polio outbreak importation in 2013. However, due to multiple supplementary immunization activities campaigns of improved quality and enhanced surveillance, the outbreak was eventually successfully interrupted within 6 months of confirmation. The most recent emergence of polio in Ethiopia has seen in this year (2020) six years after the country documented zero polio cases since 2014. The cause of the resurgence of the disease is circulating vaccine derived polio virus-2. Currently, Ethiopia has been conducting outbreak response by declaring Mop-up campaigns since September 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, it can be recommended that: - 1. The country has to completely shift from oral polio virus vaccine to inactivated polio vaccine so that the risk of vaccine derived polio will be diminished; 2. Ethiopia has to strengthen the mop up campaign that it has started in September 2020 following the reemergence of the disease in the country; 3.

Most of the current investigations employ two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and animal models. However, 2D culture negates the multicellular interactions and 3D microenvironment, and animal models cannot mimic human physiology because of interspecies differences.

Indeed, COVID19 increases the risk of cardiovascular occlusive/thrombotic events and is linked to poor outcomes. The pathophysiological processes underlying COVID19-induced thrombosis are complex, and remain poorly understood. To this end, platelets play important roles in regulating our cardiovascular system, including via contributions to coagulation and inflammation. There is an ample of evidence that circulating platelets are activated in COVID19 patients, which is a primary driver of the thrombotic outcome observed in these patients. However, the comprehensive molecular basis of platelet activation in COVID19 disease remains elusive, which warrants more investigation. Hence, we employed gene co-expression network analysis combined with pathways enrichment analysis to further investigate the aforementioned issues. Our study revealed three important gene clusters/modules that were closely related to COVID19. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that these three modules were mostly related to platelet metabolism, protein translation, mitochondrial activity, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, and apoptosis, suggesting a hyperactivation status of platelets in COVID19. We identified the three hub genes from each of three key modules according to their intramodular connectivity value ranking, namely: COPE, CDC37, CAPNS1, AURKAIP1, LAMTOR2, GABARAP MT-ND1, MT-ND5, and MTRNR2L12.

We aimed to assess the effect of proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) on the occurrence of refractory ineffective triggering. DESIGN: Observational assessment followed by prospective cross-over physiological study. SETTING: Academic medical ICU. PATIENTS: Ineffective triggering was detected during PSV by a twice-daily inspection of the ventilators screen. The impact of pressure support level (PSL) adjustments on the occurrence of asynchrony was recorded. Patients experiencing refractory ineffective triggering, defined as persisting asynchrony at the lowest tolerated PSL, were included in the physiological study. INTERVENTIONS: Physiological study: Flow, airway, and esophageal pressures were continuously recorded during 10 min under PSV with the lowest tolerated PSL, and then under PAV+ with the gain adjusted to target a muscle pressure between 5 and 10 cmH(2)O. MEASUREMENTS: Primary endpoint was the comparison of asynchrony index between PSV and PAV+ after PSL and gain adjustments. RESULTS: Among 36 patients identified having ineffective triggering under PSV, 21 (58%) exhibited refractory ineffective triggering. The lowest tolerated PSL was higher in patients with refractory asynchrony as compared to patients with non-refractory ineffective triggering. Twelve out of the 21 patients with refractory ineffective triggering were included in the physiological study. The median lowest tolerated PSL was 17 cmH(2)O [12C18] with a PEEP of 7 cmH(2)O [5C8] and FiO(2) of 40% [39C42]. The median gain during PAV+ was 73% [65C80]. The asynchrony index was significantly lower during PAV+ than PSV (2.7% [1.0C5.4] vs. 22.7% [10.3C40.1], p < 0.001) and consistently decreased in every patient with PAV+.

Clinically, YPFS has been widely used to regulate immune functions; however, the action mechanism of it is not known. Here, we addressed this issue by providing detail analyses of chemical and biological properties of YPFS. By using rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, fifteen chemicals deriving from different herbs of YPFS were determined, and which served as a control for the standardization of the herbal extract of YPFS. In general, the amounts of chosen chemical markers were higher in a preparation of YPFS as compared to that of single herb or two-herb compositions. In order to reveal the immune functions of YPFS, the standardized extract was applied onto cultured murine macrophages. The treatment of YPFS stimulated the mRNA and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-B by enhancing IB degradation. In contrast, the application of YPFS suppressed the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic inflammation model. In addition, YPFS could up regulate the phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. These results therefore supported the bi-directional immune-modulatory roles of YPFS in regulating the releases of cytokines from macrophages.","output":"Yu Ping Feng San, an Ancient Chinese Herbal Decoction Containing Astragali Radix, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae Radix, Regulates the Release of Cytokines in Murine Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives Efforts to develop and deploy effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue at pace Here, we describe rational antigen design through to manufacturability and vaccine efficacy of a prefusion-stabilised spike (S) protein, Sclamp, in combination with the licensed adjuvant MF59 ?MF59C 1?

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.","output":"High risk of thrombosis in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multicenter prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 3-layered backpropagation connectionist network, configured as an autoassociator, learned to form global (e.g., mammal) before basic-level (e.g., cat) category representations from perceptual input.

Plague is a rodent-borne disease that has historically shown an outstanding ability to colonize and persist across different species, habitats, and environments while provoking sporadic cases, outbreaks, and deadly global epidemics among humans. Between September and November 2017, an outbreak of urban pneumonic plague was declared in Madagascar, which refocused the attention of the scientific community on this ancient human scourge. Given recent trends and plague's resilience to control in the wild, its high fatality rate in humans without early treatment, and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems, human plague should be considered as a neglected threat. A workshop was held in Paris in July 2018 to review current knowledge about plague and to identify the scientific research priorities to eradicate plague as a human threat. It was concluded that an urgent commitment is needed to develop and fund a strong research agenda aiming to fill the current knowledge gaps structured around 4 main axes: (i) an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the reservoir, vector, pathogen, and environment; (ii) human and societal responses; (iii) improved diagnostic tools and case management; and (iv) vaccine development.

In 2018, the European WNV epidemic resulted in over 2000 cases, representing the most important arboviral epidemic in the European continent. Characterization of inflammation and neuronal biomarkers released during WNV infection, especially in the context of neuronal impairments, could provide insight into the development of predictive tools that could be beneficial for patient outcomes. We first analyzed the inflammatory signature in the serum of WNV-infected mice and found increased concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines. We next analyzed serum and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) samples from a cohort of patients infected by WNV between 2018 and 2019 in Hungary to quantify a large panel of inflammatory cytokines and neurological factors. We found higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL4, IL6, and IL10) and neuronal factors (e.g., BDNF, GFAP, MIF, TDP-43) in the sera of WNV-infected patients with neuroinvasive disease. Furthermore, the serum inflammatory profile of these patients persisted for several weeks after initial infection, potentially leading to long-term sequelae and having a deleterious effect on brain neurovasculature.

Experiences indicated that e-cigarette users were aware of information regarding EVALI and received information from numerous sources. Information was filtered for legitimacy of EVALI claims and causes of EVALI. Risk rationalizations were developed to assess potential harm of continued e-cigarette use and provided reasoning for behavioral responses to EVALI. The emerging harm associated with EVALI prompted e-cigarette users to engage in a cognitive process resulting in employment of a range of rationalities to justify continued use.

Identifying variables related to moral sensitivity can help in planning to increase nurses moral sensitivity. This study aimed to investigate the relationship among mindfulness, empathy, and moral sensitivity in a sample of nurses. METHODS: In the present study, a cross-sectional design utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was conducted. The nurses in a private hospital in Yazd, Iran, were invited to participate in the study (n=162) using simple random sampling. In order to gather the data, the Freiburgs mindfulness inventory, moral sensitivity questionnaire, and revised Jeffersons empathy scale were used. The hypothesized model was analyzed by SEM. RESULTS: The results show that Mindfulness (=0.41, t=5.53, p<0.01) and empathy (=0.52, t=6.77, p<0.01) had a significant direct effect on moral sensitivity. However, mindfulness had an indirect effect on nurses moral sensitivity via empathy improvement (z= 6.25, p<.01).

The current study investigated the clinical and economic outcomes of intervention policies combining nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination programs for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An agent-based transmission model was adopted that describes how a SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads in the populations of China. The model inputs were derived from the literature and expert opinion. The following intervention policies were simulated: no intervention, strict nonpharmaceutical interventions, and nonpharmaceutical interventions for workplace, community, school and home gradually terminated by combining vaccination programs for specified age groups (vaccination age in years: 20C60, 20C70, 20C80, 20, 10 and whole population). Cumulative infections and deaths in one calendar year, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured. When the vaccination program was taken up in at least the 20 years age group in all populations, nonpharmaceutical interventions for workplace and community settings could be gradually terminated because the cumulative number of infections was < 100 per 100,000 persons. Further ending nonpharmaceutical interventions in school and home settings could not meet the target even when the vaccination program had been taken up in all populations. When cumulative deaths were used as the endpoint, nonpharmaceutical interventions in workplace, community and school settings could be gradually terminated. Vaccine efficacy and coverage have substantial impacts. Terminating nonpharmaceutical interventions in workplace settings could produce the lowest cost when vaccination programs are taken up at least in the 10 years age group; this method dominates most intervention strategies due to its lower costs and higher QALYs.

Fast diagnosis of the disease and knowing its severity are the two significant concerns of all physicians. Even though positive or negative diagnosis can be obtained through the RT-PCR test, an automatic model that predicts severity and the diagnosis will help medical practitioners to a great extend for affirming medication. Machine learning is an efficient tool that can process vast volume of data deposited in various formats, including clinical symptoms. In this work, we have developed machine learning models for analysing a clinical data set comprising 65000 records of patients, consisting of 26 features. An optimum set of features was derived from this data set by the proposed variant of artificial bee colony optimization algorithm. By making use of these features, a binary classifier is modelled with support vector machine for the screening of COVID-19 patients. Different models were tested for this purpose and the support vector machine has showcased the highest accuracy of 96%. Successively, severity prediction in COVID positive patients was also performed successfully by the logistic regression model. The model managed to predict three severity status viz mild, moderate, and severe. The confusion matrix and the precision-recall values (0.96 and 0.97) of the binary classifier indicate the classifiers efficiency in predicting positive cases correctly. The receiver operating curve generated for the severity predicting model shows the highest accuracy, 96.0% for class 1 and 85.0% for class 2 patients.

Two days before VAP onset we observed a transcriptional signature of bacterial infection. Two weeks prior to VAP onset, following intubation, we observed a striking impairment in immune signaling in COVID-19 patients who developed VAP. Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis revealed disruption of lung microbiome community composition in patients with VAP, providing a connection between dysregulated immune signaling and outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens.

The nucleocapsid and glycoprotein sequences are identical for the three novel 2019 human isolates and they are closely related to these sequences in six bat and human SARS coronaviruses. This strongly supports the bat origin of the pandemic, novel coronavirus. One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus. BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains. This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development.

However, clinical studies addressing this association have yielded conflicting results. We sought to analyze the impact of sex hormones, age, and cardiovascular disease on ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 expression in different mouse models. ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 expression was analyzed by immunostaining in a variety of tissues obtained from FVB/N mice undergoing either gonadectomy or sham-surgery and being subjected to ischemiaCreperfusion injury or transverse aortic constriction surgery. In lung tissues sex did not have a significant impact on the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2. On the contrary, following myocardial injury, female sex was associated to a lower expression of ACE-2 at the level of the kidney tubules. In addition, after myocardial injury, a significant correlation between younger age and higher expression of both ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 was observed for lung alveoli and bronchioli, kidney tubules, and liver sinusoids. Our experimental data indicate that gonadal hormones and biological sex do not alter ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 expression in the respiratory tract in mice, independent of disease state. Thus, sex differences in ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 protein expression observed in mice may not explain the higher disease burden of COVID-19 among men.","output":"Immunoreactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins ACE-2 and TMPRSS-2 in murine models of hormonal manipulation, ageing, and cardiac injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a relevant threat for humans worldwide.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, the characteristics and the clinical impact of abnormal LFTs in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we collected data about 565 inpatients with COVID-19. Data on LFTs were collected at admission and every 7  2 days during the hospitalization. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Upon admission 329 patients (58%) had LFTs abnormality. Patients with abnormal LFTs had more severe inflammation and higher degree of organ dysfunction than those without. During hospitalization, patients with abnormal LFTs had a higher rate of transfer to ICU (20% vs 8%; P < .001), acute kidney injury (22% vs 13%, P = .009), need for mechanical ventilation (14% vs 6%; P = .005) and mortality (21% vs 11%; P = .004) than those without.

This study aims to assess the impact of a 6-week PR programme on maximal exercise capacity and other outcomes among adults in Uganda living with PTBLD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised waiting-list controlled trial with blinded outcome measures, comparing PR versus usual care for patients with PTBLD. A total of 114 participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive either usual care (on the waiting list) or PR, with follow-up assessments at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention. The primary outcome is change in walking distance measured by the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test from baseline to the end of 6 weeks of PR. All secondary outcomes will be compared between the PR and usual care arms from baseline to 6-week and 12-week follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include self-reported respiratory symptoms, physical activity, psychological well-being, health-related quality of life and costCbenefit analysis. All randomised participants will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis population.

The aim of this study, based on semi-structured interviews with upper secondary-school pupils in Stockholm, was to explore how Swedish pupils perceive their ERT and to understand their preconditions for learning. We found variations among pupils with regard to how they perceived their new morning routine, the increased flexibility in structuring their day, the flexibility to choose their workplace at home, and the decreased control by their teachers. While some perceived the increased flexibility as challenging, others appraised it as a possibility to be more independent. With regard to their classmates, all participants perceived difficulties learning from each other in ERT. Identified difficulties involved comparing one's performance to that of classmates, having deep discussions, encouraging each other, and organizing themselves in a group.

Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain.

This systematic literature review aimed to gain insight into public perceptions and behavioral responses to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, with a focus on trends over time and regional differences. We screened 5498 articles and identified 70 eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, and PsychINFO. Public misconceptions were apparent regarding modes of transmission and preventive measures. Perceptions and behaviors evolved during the pandemic. In most countries, perceived vulnerability increased, but perceived severity, anxiety, self-efficacy, and vaccination intention decreased. Improved hygienic practices and social distancing were practiced most commonly. However, vaccination acceptance remained low. Marked regional differences were noted. To prevent misconceptions, it is important that health authorities provide up-to-date information about the virus and possible preventive measures during future outbreaks. Health authorities should continuously monitor public perceptions and misconceptions. Because public perceptions and behaviors varied between countries during the pandemic, risk communication should be tailored to the specific circumstances of each country. Finally, the use of health behavior theories in studies of public perceptions and behaviors during outbreaks would greatly facilitate the development of effective public health interventions that counter the effect of an outbreak.","output":"Perceptions and behavioral responses of the general public during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. METHODS: We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. MannCWhitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2C5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0C3] (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.","output":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutation hot spots include a novel RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study surveys the clinical relevance of the nasal Staphylococcus aureus colonization status on intensive care unit (ICU)Cacquired S. aureus infections and compares molecular characteristics of isolates from the nose and infectious sites. The 390 patients included comprised 278 non-carriers and 112 carriers. Among the carriers, 56 were decolonized with mupirocin. Decolonization was verified through a second (negative) culture. Spa typing and virulence gene profiling were performed for all isolates. Twenty six S. aureus infections were detected in the carriage group and 20 in the non-carriage group. Eighteen of these 26 (69.2%) infections were among carriers, and 8 of these 26 (30.8%) infections occurred among decolonized carriers (p = 0.02). Overall, 31/112 (27.7%) of the colonized patients and 25/46 (60.1%) of infection were due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The highest frequency virulence genes were sea and hlg (both 100%) in nasal isolates and sea, hlg, fnb, and clf (100%) for infectious isolates. t030 was the most abundant spa type overall. S. aureus carriers were more likely to develop S. aureus infection compared with decolonized and non-carrying patients. The sources of ICU S. aureus infection appear to be exogenous mostly, and a predominant clone (spa type 030) plays an important role.

But concerns regarding inclusion of intermediate- and high-risk pregnant women are an issue and a limitation for clinical implementation. This retrospective study evaluated the outcome and safety of extended remote self-monitoring of maternal and fetal health in intermediate- and high-risk pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study reports on 400 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, high-risk of preeclampsia, or a history of previous fetal or neonatal loss. Remote self-monitoring was performed by pregnant women and included C-reactive protein, non-stress test by cardiotocography, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and a questionnaire concerning maternal and fetal wellbeing. Data were transferred to the hospital using a mobile device platform and evaluated by healthcare professionals. In case of non-reassuring registrations, the pregnant women were invited for assessment at the hospital. Primary outcome was perinatal death. Secondary outcomes were other maternal and perinatal complications. RESULTS No severe maternal complications were observed. Nine fetal or neonatal deaths occurred, all secondary to malformations, severe fetal growth restriction, extreme prematurity or lung hypoplasia in cases of PPROM before 24 weeks. Even in the latter group, fetal and neonatal survival was 78% (18/23) and rose to 97% (60/62) when PPROM occurred after a gestational age 23+6 weeks. None of the fetal or neonatal deaths were attributable to the home-management setting. CONCLUSIONS Home-monitoring including remote self-monitoring of fetal and maternal well-being in intermediate- and high-risk pregnancies seems to be a safe alternative to inpatient or frequent outpatient care, which sets the stage for a new way of thinking of hospital care. The implementation process included staff training workshops and development of patient enrollment practice with clarification of expectations and responsibilities, which can be crucial to the results.","output":"Home management by remote self-monitoring in intermediate- and high-risk pregnancies: A retrospective study of 400 consecutive women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While pathogens often evolve towards reduced virulence, many counterexamples are evident. When faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is highly desirable to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) into the future. Considerable effort has been invested towards the development of a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although these approaches accurately recapitulate some complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between mortality and infectivity. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Results: Using a compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity, we reveal kinetic constraints where the variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased virulence and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as Smallpox, are likely often constrained by host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: The evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in virulence should not be assumed. Our findings imply that, without continued public health intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. The existence of a parameter regime admitting endemic equilibrium suggests that herd immunity is unachievable. However, we demonstrate that even partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of the virus towards reduced virulence.","output":"Evolution of Human Respiratory Virus Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects multiple organs. Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Health System show that substantial numbers of COVID-19 patients without prior heart disease develop cardiac dysfunction. How COVID-19 patients develop cardiac disease is not known. We integrated cell biological and physiological analyses of human cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence of interleukins (ILs) with clinical findings related to laboratory values in COVID-19 patients to identify plausible mechanisms of cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients. We infected hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from healthy human subjects with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence and presence of IL-6 and IL-1. Infection resulted in increased numbers of multinucleated cells. Interleukin treatment and infection resulted in disorganization of myofibrils, extracellular release of troponin I, and reduced and erratic beating. Infection resulted in decreased expression of mRNA encoding key proteins of the cardiomyocyte contractile apparatus. Although interleukins did not increase the extent of infection, they increased the contractile dysfunction associated with viral infection of cardiomyocytes, resulting in cessation of beating. Clinical data from hospitalized patients from the Mount Sinai Health System show that a significant portion of COVID-19 patients without history of heart disease have elevated troponin and interleukin levels. A substantial subset of these patients showed reduced left ventricular function by echocardiography. Our laboratory observations, combined with the clinical data, indicate that direct effects on cardiomyocytes by interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 infection might underlie heart disease in COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs, including the heart. Analyses of hospitalized patients show that a substantial number without prior indication of heart disease or comorbidities show significant injury to heart tissue, assessed by increased levels of troponin in blood. We studied the cell biological and physiological effects of virus infection of healthy human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in culture. Virus infection with interleukins disorganizes myofibrils, increases cell size and the numbers of multinucleated cells, and suppresses the expression of proteins of the contractile apparatus. Viral infection of cardiomyocytes in culture triggers release of troponin similar to elevation in levels of COVID-19 patients with heart disease. Viral infection in the presence of interleukins slows down and desynchronizes the beating of cardiomyocytes in culture. The cell-level physiological changes are similar to decreases in left ventricular ejection seen in imaging of patients hearts. These observations suggest that direct injury to heart tissue by virus can be one underlying cause of heart disease in COVID-19.","output":"Functional Effects of Cardiomyocyte Injury in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ground-glass opacity is a very frequent and unspecified finding in chest computed tomography.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study of retinoblastoma patients at a tertiary care ocular oncology center during the first wave of COVID-19 and the resulting nationwide lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 476 eyes of 326 patients undergoing active management with a median age of 57 months (range: 4C214 months), 205 (63%) patients returned for follow-up after a mean delay of 45.8  24.3 weeks (range: 8C80 weeks) and 121 (37%) were defaulters according to the data analyzed till June 30, 2021. Distance of residence was 1000 km for 148 patients (46%). In terms of need for active treatment, the number of emergent cases was 2 (<1%), 11 (3%) were urgent, and 313 (96%) were semi-urgent. International classification groups D (n = 107 eyes, 23%) and E (n = 173 eyes, 36%) were in majority, and 13 eyes (4%) and 4 eyes (1%) were at stages 3 and 4, respectively.

METHODS: Based on the Mayo Clinic Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute and Illness and iNjury (CERTAIN) program, we designed and delivered a longitudinal 40-week remote coaching program for a community-based teaching hospital in Shandong Province, China. Based on a mixed-methods needs assessment that included learner feedback using an exploratory sequential design and ICU process and outcomes data, we developed a curriculum that included asynchronous, online learning modules with multiple language captions and weekly remote education sessions using a blend of didactic presentations on common critical care syndromes, virtual simulation, journal club, and case-based discussions. Faculty included a diverse group of critical care experts and bilingual facilitators. The program also included clinical research and quality improvement workshops to facilitate implementation of key concepts identified during these activities. Participants completed a survey using a 5 point anchored Likert scale after each educational activity to provide feedback and guide course improvement. RESULTS: Twenty-two Chinese clinicians (18 physicians, 4 nurses) enrolled in this CERTAIN longitudinal program. Learners completed a total of 163 hours (mean 7.4 hr/learner) asynchronous online learning, and to date have completed 23 weekly education sessions (total 28 hours, including an extended virtual simulation experience). Survey response rate was 56%. Learners reported a high rate of overall satisfaction with the course (112, 61% Excellent;55 (30%) Very Good) and specific topic discussions (110,60% Excellent;57, 31% Very Good), with steady improvement over time. Perceived practice relevance was also high (110, 59% Excellent;55,30% Very Good), and this effort has informed ongoing local performance improvement initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: Remote delivery of longitudinal critical care continuing education program in China using asynchronous learning, case-based discussion, and virtual simulation is feasible, associated with a high rate of learner satisfaction, and increases engagement in quality improvement initiatives. This innovative global education initiative offers an important potential solution to strengthen critical care services in remote, resource-limited settings at low cost, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We analysed Canadas top three national newspapers by circulation, namely C The Globe and Mail, The National Post and The Toronto Star, published between Jan 1, 2020 - May 31, 2020. Our search yielded a total of 378 articles across the three newspapers. Upon removing duplicates and screening the remaining articles, we included a total of 62 articles for the analysis. We conducted a qualitative media content analysis by using the inductive coding approach. Results: Three major themes were identified within the articles. These included: 1) The role of scientific and expert evidence in implementing travel restrictions;2) Federal legislation, regulations and enforcement of international travel measures;and 3) Compliance with WHO guidelines in travel restriction policy- and decision-making. The federal government relied on scientific evidence for implementing international travel restrictions. The federal government fully exercised its powers under the Quarantine Act to enforce travel regulations and comply with the IHR (2005). The government embraced rules-based international order by following WHO recommendations on international travel, contributing to delaying border closure and travel restrictions until mid-March.

OBJECTIVE We sought to understand the relationship between neuroimaging markers such as tau pathology and cognitive symptoms both with and without the presence of NPS during the prodromal period of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS A total of 151 MCI subjects with tau positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning with 18F AV-1451, amyloid- (A) PET scanning with florbetapir or florbetaben, magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive and behavioral evaluations were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. A 4-group division approach was proposed using amyloid (A-/A+) and behavior (B-/B+) status: A-B-, A-B+, A+B-, and A+B+. Pearson's correlation test was conducted for each group to examine the association between tau deposition and cognitive performance. RESULTS No statistically significant association between tau deposition and cognitive impairment was found for subjects without behavior symptoms in either the A-B-or A+B-groups after correction for false discovery rate. In contrast, tau deposition was found to be significantly associated with cognitive impairment in entorhinal cortex and temporal pole for the A-B+ group and nearly the whole cerebrum for the A+B+ group. CONCLUSION Enhanced associations between tauopathy and cognitive impairment are present in MCI subjects with behavior symptoms, which is more prominent in the presence of elevated amyloid pathology. MCI individuals with NPS may thus be at greater risk for further cognitive decline with the increase of tau deposition in comparison to those without NPS.","output":"Enhanced Association of Tau Pathology and Cognitive Impairment in Mild Cognitive Impairment Subjects with Behavior Symptoms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although there are various models of epidemic diseases, there are a few individual-based models that can guide susceptible individuals on how they should behave in a pandemic without its appropriate treatment.

This study analyzed the performance and correlation of two quantitative anti-S1 assays in oligo-/asymptomatic individuals from a population-based cohort. METHODS: In total, 362 plasma samples (108 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]-positive pharyngeal swabs, 111 negative controls, and 143 with positive serology without confirmation by RT-PCR) were tested with quantitative assays (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EI-S1-IgG-quant]) and Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [Ro-RBD-Ig-quant]), which were compared with each other and confirmatory tests, including wild-type virus micro-neutralization (NT) and GenScript?cPass&#8482;. Square roots R of coefficients of determination were calculated for continuous variables and non-parametric tests were used for paired comparisons. RESULTS: Quantitative anti-S1 serology correlated well with each other (true positives, 96%; true negatives, 97%). Antibody titers decreased over time (< 30 to > 240 days after initial positive RT-PCR). Agreement with GenScript-cPass was 96%/99% for true positives and true negatives, respectively, for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and 93%/97% for EI-S1-IgG-quant. Ro-RBD-Ig-quant allowed distinct separation between positives and negatives, and less non-specific reactivity versus EI-S1-IgG-quant.

We sought to assess strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital setting via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation, tracing and quarantine, wearing facial masks/ personal protective equipment. Methods: We developed an individual-based model for COVID-19 transmission among healthcare workers in a hospital setting. We calibrated the model using data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital unit in Wuhan in a Bayesian framework. The calibrated model was used to simulate different intervention scenarios and estimate the impact of different interventions on outbreak size and workday loss. Results: We estimated that work-related stress increases susceptibility to COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers by 52% (90% Credible Interval (CrI): 16.4% - 93.0%). The use of high efficacy facial masks was shown to be able to reduce infection cases and workday loss by 80% (90% CrI: 73.1% - 85.7%) and 87% (CrI: 80.0% - 92.5%), respectively. The use of social distancing alone, through reduced contacts between healthcare workers, had a marginal impact on the outbreak. A strict quarantine policy with the isolation of symptomatic cases and a high fraction of pre-symptomatic/ asymptomatic cases (via contact tracing or high test rate), could only prolong outbreak duration with minimal impact on the outbreak size. Our results indicated that a quarantine policy should be coupled with other interventions to achieve its effect. The effectiveness of all these interventions was shown to increase with their early implementation. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that a COVID-19 outbreak in a hospital's non-COVID-19 unit can be controlled or mitigated by the use of existing non-pharmaceutical measures.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control in a hospital setting: an individual-based modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a notable increase in psychological distress, globally. Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions that aim to improve the elevated levels of psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F1,43=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (?=-3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F1,43=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (?=-4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of online therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman. Therapist-guided online therapy was found to be superior to self-help, internet-based therapy; however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.

Numerous ethical challenges have arisen at different levels, be it at the policy-making level or on the ground. For example, policymakers have to contain a highly contagious disease with high morbidity using scarce resources, while minimizing the medium- to long-term social and economic impacts induced by containment measures. This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations in Malaysia by using an intersectional framework that accounts for overlapping forms of marginalization. Methods: This study utilizes in-depth qualitative data obtained from 34 individuals and organizations to understand the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on vulnerable populations in Malaysia. We utilize four principles of ethics to guide our coding and interpretation of the data C namely beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and autonomy. We utilize a frequency analysis to roughly understand the types of ethical issues that emerged. Using hermeneutic content analysis (HCA), we then explore how the principles interact with each other. Results: Through the frequently analysis, we found that although beneficence was very prevalent in our dataset, so was a significant amount of harm C as perpetuated through injustice, the removal or lack of autonomy and maleficence. We also unearthed a worrying landscape of harm and deep systemic issues associated with a lack of support for vulnerable households C further exacerbated during the pandemic. Conclusions: Policy recommendations for aid organizations and society to mitigate these ethical problems are presented, such as long overdue institutional reforms and stronger ethical practices rooted in human rights principles, which government agencies and aid providers can then use in the provision of aid to vulnerable populations.","output":"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on vulnerable populations in Malaysia through an ethical lens: A study of non-state actors involved in aid distribution [version 2;peer review: 2 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of gynecomastia by evaluating computed tomography (CT) images of male patients who were admitted to our hospital during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Materials and Methods: This study included a total of 1,877 patients who underwent chest CT for prediagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15th and May 15th, 2020 All images were evaluated for the presence of gynecomastia Gynecomastia patterns were evaluated according to morphological features, and diagnoses were made by measuring the largest glandular tissue diameter Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software version 25 0 Results: The prevalence of gynecomastia was 32 3% In terms of pattern, 22% were nodular, 57% were dendritic, and 21% were diffuse glandular gynecomastia A significant correlation was found between age and gynecomastia pattern (p&lt;0 001) The incidence of nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular gynecomastia increased with advancing age A significant difference was found in the analysis of the correlation between age groups and glandular tissue diameters (p&lt;0 001) With an increase in glandular tissue diameter, the gynecomastia pattern changed from a nodular to a diffuse glandular pattern Conclusion: In our study, gynecomastia diagnosis was made through axial CT images Although CT should not replace mammography and ultrasonography for clinical diagnosis of gynecomastia, chest CT scans can be used to evaluate patients with suspected gynecomastia","output":"Prevalence of Incidental Gynecomastia by Chest Computed Tomography in Patients with a Prediagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus pandemic is affecting global health systems, endangering daily patient care. Hemato-oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, requiring decisive recommendations on treatment and triage. The aim of this survey amongst experts on radiation therapy (RT) for lymphoma and leukemia is to delineate typical clinical scenarios and to provide counsel for high-quality care. METHODS: A multi-item questionnaire containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was developed in a peer-reviewed process and sent to members of the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance. Answers were assessed online and analyzed centrally. RESULTS: Omission of RT was only considered in a minority of cases if alternative treatment options were available. Hypofractionated regimens and reduced dosages may be used for indolent lymphoma and fractures due to multiple myeloma. Overall, there was a tendency to shorten RT rather than to postpone or omit it. Even in case of critical resource shortage, panelists agreed to start emergency RT for typical indications (intracranial pressure, spinal compression, superior vena cava syndrome) within 24a?h. Possible criteria to consider for patient triage are the availability of (systemic) options, the underlying disease dynamic, and the treatment rationale (curative/palliative). CONCLUSION: RT for hemato-oncological patients receives high-priority and should be maintained even in later stages of the pandemic. Hypofractionation and shortened treatment schedules are feasible options for well-defined constellations, but have to be discussed in the clinical context.","output":"Radiation treatment of hemato-oncological patients in times of the COVID-19 pandemic : Expert recommendations from the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dengue and malaria are two common, mosquito-borne infections, which may lead to mortality if not managed properly. Concurrent infections of dengue and malaria are rare due to the different habitats of its vectors and activities of different carrier mosquitoes. The first case reported was in 2005. Since then, several concurrent infections have been reported between the dengue virus (DENV) and the malaria protozoans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Symptoms of each infection may be masked by a simultaneous second infection, resulting in late treatment and severe complications. Plasmodium knowlesi is also a common cause of malaria in Malaysia with one of the highest rates of mortality. This report is one of the earliest in literature of concomitant infection between DENV and P. knowlesi in which a delay in diagnosis had placed a patient in a life-threatening situation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year old man staying near the Belum-Temengor rainforest at the MalaysiaCThailand border was admitted with fever for 6 days, with respiratory distress. His non-structural protein 1 antigen and Anti-DENV Immunoglobulin M tests were positive. He was treated for severe dengue with compensated shock. Treating the dengue had so distracted the clinicians that a blood film for the malaria parasite was not done. Despite aggressive supportive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient had unresolved acidosis as well as multi-organ failure involving respiratory, renal, liver, and haematological systems. It was due to the presentation of shivering in the ICU, that a blood film was done on the second day that revealed the presence of P. knowlesi with a parasite count of 520,000/L. The patient was subsequently treated with artesunate-doxycycline and made a good recovery after nine days in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: This case contributes to the body of literature on co-infection between DENV and P. knowlesi and highlights the clinical consequences, which can be severe. Awareness should be raised among health-care workers on the possibility of dengue-malaria co-infection in this region. Further research is required to determine the real incidence and risk of co-infection in order to improve the management of acute febrile illness.","output":"The dangers of accepting a single diagnosis: case report of concurrent Plasmodium knowlesi malaria and dengue infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a general reorganization of rehabilitation services in Italy.

The velocity of respiratory flow was scaled using similarity laws between air and water. Breath simulation was performed via a computer-controlled piston-cylinder system. Food-dye visualization allows a qualitative analysis of the re-inhaled fraction of this exhaled flow. For the quantitative analysis, neutrally buoyant particles were added to the water medium, and illuminated by the laser which illuminates the whole breathing region of the respiratory model, such that the trajectory and quantity of the re-inhaled particles can be recorded and counted. The experimental results in the pediatric airway replica show that a negligible fraction (<0.06%) of the exhaled airflow is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing in the absence of the rising thermal plume. The artificial plume generated by a heated aluminium brick at the tank bottom increases the re-inhalation ratio by 4 times under the investigated case (albeit still at a very low value of 0.15%).

Based on promising results of in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, this study was conducted with the aim to demonstrate the prophylactic role of oral ivermectin in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhubaneswar. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, which has been providing both COVID and non-COVID care since March 2020. All employees and students of the institute who provided written informed consent participated in the study. The uptake of two doses of oral ivermectin (300 g/kg/dose at a gap of 72 hours) was considered as exposure. The primary outcome of the study was COVID-19 infection in the following month of ivermectin consumption, diagnosed as per Government of India testing criteria (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) guidelines. The log-binomial model was used to estimate adjusted relative risk (ARR), and the Kaplan-Meier failure plot was used to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infection with follow-up time. Results Of 3892 employees, 3532 (90.8%) participated in the study. The ivermectin uptake was 62.5% and 5.3% for two doses and single dose, respectively. Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6% vs 15%). HCWs who had taken two doses of oral ivermectin had a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 infection during the following month (ARR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.12-0.23). Females had a lower risk of contracting COVID-19 than males (ARR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.93). The absolute risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 9.7%. Only 1.8% of the participants reported adverse events, which were mild and self-limiting. Conclusion Two doses of oral ivermectin (300 g/kg/dose given 72 hours apart) as chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection by 83% in the following month.

The aim of this paper is to study the prevalence of sexting and online sexual victimization behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown in Spanish adults in order to explore how social distancing has affected these behaviors. The sample comprised 293 Spanish adults (mean age = 30.3; 66.2% female) who took part in an online survey about their engagement in sexting behaviors and online sexual victimization experiences. Overall results were apparently not supportive of our main hypothesis, showing that both sexting engagement and online sexual victimization decreased during lockdown despite the increase in internet use. Apart from differences in time period of reference, some alternative hypotheses relate to the increased presence of capable guardians according to the routine activities theory and to forced distance as a demotivation to sext.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are key to the continued effort to overcome the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of HCWs toward COVID-19 in primary health centers in Dubai. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at four primary health centers in Dubai, including two fever clinics, from July 5th to July 11th, 2020. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to nurses and physicians working in these centers, which evaluated their knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 and their associations with the participants' demographic factors. A total score of 80% and above constituted a level of sufficiency in each section. Additionally, Mann-Whitney U test and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze the variables. Results: A total of 176 HCWs completed the questionnaire, with a 91.2% (176/193) response rate. They were predominantly female (158/176, 90.0%), nurses (128/176, 72.7%), and non-Emiratis (150/176, 85.2%). While official health organizations were the primary source of information for 91.5% (161/176) of participants, only 38.1% (67/176) reported using scientific journals as one of their sources. Overall, 57.4% (101/176) of participants had a sufficient overall level of knowledge. Moreover, knowledge regarding signs, symptoms, and at-risk groups was generally satisfactory. However, knowledge about the virus, testing, transmission, and the isolation of contacts with positive cases was identified correctly by less than two-thirds of the participants. Half of the participants (89/176, 50.6%) expressed their concern about personally acquiring the infection, 112/176 (63.6%) worried about their relatives acquiring it, and 72/176 (40.9%) expressed some hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine once available. Overall, only 58/176 (33.0%) HCWs had a sufficient overall positive attitude score. Nurses, compared to physicians, and non-Emiratis compared to Emiratis' HCWs, had statistically higher mean scores for attitude (U = 2,212, p < 0.01; and U = 1164.5, p < 0.01, respectively). The majority of participants (156/176, 88.6%) reported acceptable infection control practices. Conclusion: Given the gaps identified in the knowledge and attitude, we recommend further training to improve the skills of primary HCWs, with encouragement to practice evidence-based medicine.

Data from developed countries have shown a high prevalence of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. However, parental vaccine hesitancy data in low- and middle-income countries are scarce. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of parental vaccine hesitancy and identify subgroups with higher odds of vaccine hesitancy in parents in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on the parents of children aged <18 years from October 10, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Parents participated in face-to-face interviews in randomly selected locations in Bangladesh using a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 2,633 eligible parents were analyzed. Overall, 42.8% reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for their youngest child. The final model suggested the following factors were associated with hesitancy: children's age; parent's age, religion, occupation, monthly household income, permanent address, living location, status of tobacco use, adherence with regular government vaccination programs (other than COVID-19), perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy among Bangladeshi children, self-vaccination intentions, reported family members' illness or death from COVID-19, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were the independent predictors of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conversely, participants who were not tobacco users, parents who were very likely to believe that their children or family members could be infected with COVID-19 in the following year and who were very concerned about their children or a family member contracting COVID-19 in the next year had significantly lower odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Our study suggested that vaccine hesitation varied based on sociodemographic characteristics, religion, behavior, and perceived COVID-19 threat. Therefore, interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among specific subgroups are warranted.","output":"Parental coronavirus disease vaccine hesitancy for children in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionIt is observed that many healthcare workers got COVID-19 infection despite of completing both doses of Covishield vaccine.

However, few studies have explored exhausted T cell subpopulations in human cancers. In the present study, we examined samples from two cohorts of 175 patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) by multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to investigate two subsets of Tex, CD8(+)PD1(+)TCF1(+) progenitor exhausted T cells (TCF1(+)Tex(prog)) and CD8(+)PD1(+)TCF1(?) terminally exhausted T cells (TCF1(?)Tex(term)). Moreover, fresh tumor samples from 34 patients with HNSCC were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to further investigate their properties and cytotoxic capabilities and their correlation with regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). mIHC and flow cytometry analysis showed that TCF1(?)Tex(term) represented a greater proportion of CD8(+)PD1(+)Tex than TCF1(+)Tex(prog) in most patients. TCF1(+)Tex(prog) produced abundant TNF, while TCF1(?)Tex(term) expressed higher levels of CD103, TIM-3, CTLA-4, and TIGIT. TCF1(?)Tex(term) exhibited a polyfunctional TNF(+)GZMB(+)IFN(+) phenotype; and were associated with better overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The results also indicated that larger proportions of TCF1(?)Tex(term) were accompanied by an increase in the proportion of Tregs.

Specifically, we examined whether fear of the virus would impact the women's distress symptoms, self-rated health (SRH), and marital satisfaction. A total of 130 Israeli married women with children completed the survey during the lockdown restrictions period. All participants reported that their children were living with them during the lockdown, and that no one had been infected by the virus. The results indicated that fear of COVID-19 was negatively associated with SRH as well as marital satisfaction, and positively associated with psychological distress. In addition, psychological distress mediated the link between fear of COVID-19 and both SRH and marital satisfaction. To mitigate similar negative consequences in the future, it is suggested that interventions should focus on the way the crisis is presented in the public domain.

Considering that learning programming is not an easy task as well as the social, cultural, and educational diversity of the student population, we believe it is crucial that teachers have at their disposal up-to-date information on the learners' progress, skills, and difficulties to properly support them in gaining and maintaining a positive learning momentum. Previously, we suggested the use of this monitoring tool to supplement the information teachers can obtain through direct observation in traditional face-to-face classes. However, in the context of the current pandemic, its use takes on new significance since, in most cases, face-to-face instruction has been suppressed, demanding new strategies to collect assessment data. In this paper, we introduce some features of the system and explain how they can help teachers to support their students. Key findings from a field trial, in which the system was used for about a month and a half to support more than 60 students of an introductory programming course, are also presented. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, classes took place almost exclusively online via Zoom. During this time, the usage of the system enabled the teacher to monitor student progress regardless of when or where they were working. In post-experiment interviews, the teacher who participated in this study stated that using the system was vital to deal with the challenges that distance learning entails. Similarly, student feedback was also very positive. Several students mentioned that they felt more confident while using the system, knowing that the teacher was able to track their work and give them personalized feedback whenever necessary. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"The importance of using the CodeInsights monitoring tool to support teaching programming in the context of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Belgian government set out a range of measures to prevent the spread of the virus. One measure included closing all non-food shops, including vape shops. METHODS: A retrospective online questionnaire was used to investigate the impact of closing the vape shops on the vaping and/or smoking behavior of current vapers. RESULTS: The sample (n = 202) reached consisted of 70% exclusive vapers, 29% dual users and 1% no-product users. Over half (55%, 112/202) of participants needed to buy e-liquid during the lockdown, with a small majority being able to buy e-liquids C mostly with their usual nicotine concentrations, flavor or brand C, but as much as 39% (44/112) of them ran out of e-liquid. Those buying e-liquid mainly did so by making purchases via foreign online webshops. A similar pattern was observed with respect to purchasing hardware, with about half (47%, 95/202) of participants reporting hardware availability and with a small majority (53%, 107/202) reporting hardware unavailability. Of those indicating that hardware was not available, 38% (41/107) ran out of a properly functioning e-cigarette. A non-trivial minority had to consume e-liquids with another nicotine concentration, flavor or brand than usual. One seventh of exclusive vapers before lockdown relapsed partly or completely to smoking during the lockdown. The main reasons for changing vaping and/or smoking behavior included the unavailability of e-liquid with nicotine, the unavailability of hardware, and stress/worries about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of vapers succeeded in maintaining their vaping behavior as usual, highly likely due to (illegally) buying consumables online. Nevertheless, for a minority the lockdown period resulted in unintended consequences and these vapers relapsed (completely) to smoking. Even during periods of lockdown, smokers and vapers should be able to purchase low(er)-risk alternatives to smoking, for example e-cigarettes.

Here, we show that autophagy is specifically induced in vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human volunteers. In addition, reduced IFN secretion by RSV-induced T cells in older vaccinees correlates with low autophagy levels. We demonstrate that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in human T cells with age. Spermidine supplementation in T cells from old donors recovers their autophagy level and function, similar to young donors cells, in which spermidine biosynthesis has been inhibited. Finally, our data show that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy via the translation factor eIF5A and transcription factor TFEB. In summary, we have provided evidence for the importance of autophagy in vaccine immunogenicity in older humans and uncovered two novel drug targets that may increase vaccination efficiency in the aging context.","output":"Autophagy in T cells from aged donors is maintained by spermidine and correlates with function and vaccine responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 transmission remains high around the world, and severe local outbreaks continue to occur. Prognostic tools may be useful in crisis conditions as risk stratification can help determine resource allocation. One published tool, the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage Severity Score, seems particularly promising because of its predictive ability and ease of application at the bedside. We sought to understand the performance of a modified version of this score (mPRIEST) in our institution for identifying patients with a greater than minimal risk for adverse outcome (death or organ support) at 30 days after index visit. METHODS: Consecutive visits at two northern Manhattan EDs with a new diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 were identified between November and December of 2020. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were obtained from chart review. Outcomes were obtained from chart review and follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 306 patients. The incidence of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 days for patients in patients with mPRIEST above the threshold value was 43/181 (23.8%), and for patients below 1/125 (0.8%). The sensitivity of the score for adverse outcome was 97.7% (95% CI: 93.3% to 100%).

Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health.Results: Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets.Conclusions: Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2 weeks.

Here, both aspects of solar energy i.e., light and heat are utilized for both energy production and water heating. The semitransparent PTEC converts heat energy directly to electrical energy due to the gradient of temperature between two electrodes (top and bottom) of thermoelectric cells. The PTEC is 25% transparent, which can be varied according to the necessity of the utilizer.

There is an unmet need to develop new agents with both anti-resorptive and anabolic effects to treat osteoporosis, although drugs with either effect alone are available. A small molecular compound, Plumbagin, was reported to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting I-B- phosphorylation- mediated canonical NF-B activation. However, the key transcriptional factor RelA/p65 in canonical NF-B pathway functions to promote osteoclast precursor survival but not terminal osteoclast differentiation. Here we found that Plumbagin inhibited the activity of NF-B inducing kinase (NIK), the key molecule that controls non-canonical NF-B signaling, in a ATP/ADP based kinase assay. Consistent with this, Plumbagin inhibited processing of NF-B2 p100 to p52 in the progenitor cells of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Interestingly, Plumbagin not only inhibited osteoclast but also stimulated osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Importantly, Plumbagin prevented trabecular bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. This was associated with decreased osteoclast surfaces on trabecular surface and increased parameters of osteoblasts, including osteoblast surface on trabecular surface, bone formation rate and level of serum osteocalcin, compared to vehicle-treated mice. In summary, we conclude that Plumbagin is a NIK inhibitor with dual anabolic and anti-resorptive effects on bone, and could represent a new class of agent for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.","output":"Plumbagin is a NF-B-Inducing Kinase Inhibitor with Dual Anabolic and Anti-Resorptive Effects that Prevents Menopausal-Related Osteoporosis in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safeguarding the health and promoting the well-being and quality of life of the most vulnerable and fragile citizens is a top priority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-olds) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and children's externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and children's' externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, children's stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity.

During the special period, the health of vulnerable groups, such as children with autism, should be concerned. Some studies have been carried out to investigate the behavioral problems of children with autism during the COVID-19, but underlying mechanisms behind it is not clear. This study examines the role of parenting stress as a mediator in the relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems in Chinese children as well as the role of perceived social support as a moderator for this mediation effect. METHODS: A total of 439 parents of children with autism (mean age=40.17, SD=5.26) were surveyed and completed five questionnaires (Conners Parent Symptom Questionnaire, Parental Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Parenting Stress Index-Short Form 15, Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory). The statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS 26.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS: Controlling for neuroticism, which is highly associated with psychological changes in parents, the study found that parental self-efficacy was significantly and negatively correlated with behavioral problems in children with autism. In addition, the relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems was mediated by parenting stress. Furthermore, parenting stress moderated the indirect relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems via perceived social support. CONCLUSION: These results provide direct evidences for the inextricable relationship between family, social factors and behavioral problems of children with autism. It suggest that improving perceived social support to enhance parental self-efficacy is critical to buffering against parenting stress and stabilizing children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Parental Self-Efficacy and Behavioral Problems in Children with Autism During COVID-19: A Moderated Mediation Model of Parenting Stress and Perceived Social Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the barriers to effective pain management in Iranian people with cancer.

They attach and replicate in the susceptible and permissive hosts and host derived cell lines. They enter the cells either through direct attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Hence, to thwart the invasion by viruses, hosts have developed immunity in ascending stagesintrinsic, innate and adaptive immunity. A robust intrinsic and innate immune response governs an effective adaptive immune response, should that be needed. Both enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses are subject to distinct types of DNA sensors, subject to their site of replication. DNA sensors of viral PAMPs can be classified into three types, based on the location of their PAMPs in the host cellular compartment viz. cell surface, cytoplasmic and nuclear. The host cell membrane both, surface as well as intra cellular, is continuously monitored for the non-host, pathogenic components or PAMPs. Among the intracellular sensors of the viral genome, there are two typesessentially due to the two types of major viral genomes i.e. RNA and DNA sensors. The cytosolic DNA sensors include AIM2, IFI16, cGAS, RNA Pol III, DNA-PK, DDX9, DHX36, DDX41, DDX60, DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1 and MRE11. PYHIN family of sensors include AIM2, IFI16, IFIX and MNDA. Another recently discovered family of sensor called stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), specifically houses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions in association with its upstream sensor, cGAS. Some DNA sensors shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus pre- and post-extraneous DNA binding. These include IFI16, IFIX, RNA Pol III, etc. There is no exclusive nuclear DNA sensor. Many enzymes known to be present in the cells for their obvious primary functions also additionally function as DNA sensors. The DNAse family of sensors include DNAse II and TREX1, which are ubiquitously present in the cell for their housekeeping functions. The RNAse family of sensor includes one memberRNA Pol III. Additionally, DNA-PK also functions to cater to viral DNA sensing. The endosomal DNA sensors include TLR7 and TLR9, which belong to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. The DExD/H-box helicase family include the putative DNA sensors recently discovered including DDX9, DHX36, DDX41 and DDX60. Several other sensors remain to be characterised or are less classified viz. DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1, MRE11.

However, the sample sizes necessary to best inform decision-making are often not attainable with single studies, making pooled individual-level data analysis invaluable for public health efforts. Researchers commonly implement causal methods prevailing in their home disciplines, and how these are selected, evaluated, implemented and reported may vary widely. To our knowledge, no article has yet evaluated trends in the implementation and reporting of causal methods in studies leveraging individual-level data pooled from several studies. We undertake this review to uncover patterns in the implementation and reporting of causal methods used across disciplines in research focused on health outcomes. We will investigate variations in methods to infer causality used across disciplines, time and geography and identify gaps in reporting of methods to inform the development of reporting standards and the conversation required to effect change. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search four databases (EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science) using a search strategy developed with librarians from three universities (Heidelberg University, Harvard University, and University of California, San Francisco). The search strategy includes terms such as pool*, harmoniz*, cohort*, observational, variations on individual-level data. Four reviewers will independently screen articles using Covidence and extract data from included articles. The extracted data will be analysed descriptively in tables and graphically to reveal the pattern in methods implementation and reporting.

This could be a major issue in developing countries where access to basic sanitation is poor, leading to the sharing of toilet facilities. In this study, we report SARS-CoV-2 contamination of key contact surfaces in shared toilets and the probabilistic risks of COVID-19 infections based on detection and quantification of the nucleic acid on the surfaces. We observed that 54C69% of the contact surfaces were contaminated, with SARS-CoV-2 loads ranging from 28.1 to 132.7 gene copies per cm(2). Toilet seats had the highest contamination, which could be attributed to shedding of the virus in feces and urine. We observed a significant reduction in viral loads on the contaminated surfaces after cleaning, showing the potential of effective cleaning on the reduction of contamination. The pattern of contamination indicates that the most contaminated surfaces are those that are either commonly touched by users of the shared toilets or easily contaminated with feces and urine. These surfaces were the toilet seats, cistern handles and tap handles. The likelihood (probability) of infection with COVID-19 on these surfaces was highest on the toilet seat (1.76  10(?4)(1.58  10(?6))) for one time use of the toilet. These findings highlight the potential risks for COVID-19 infections in the event that intact infectious viral particles are deposited on these contact surfaces. Therefore, this study shows that shared toilet facilities in densely populated areas could lead to an increase in risks of COVID-19 infections. This calls for the implementation of risk reduction measures, such as regular washing of hands with soap, strict adherence to wearing face masks, and effective and regular cleaning of shared facilities.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on contact surfaces within shared sanitation facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

We investigated the effect of infection control measures implemented in the workplace on personal infection prevention behavior. Methods: We conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey through the Internet from December 22 to 25, 2020, during which period COVID-19 was spreading. Among respondents aged 20 to 65 years (n=27,036), a total of 21,915 workers were included in the analysis after excluding self-employed workers (n=2,202), workers in small/home offices (n=377), and agriculture, forestry, and fisheries workers (n=212), etc., whose personal infection prevention behavior was almost the same as infection control measures taken in the workplace. Results: The results showed that as the number of infection control measures in the workplace increased, implementation of infection prevention behavior by individuals also significantly increased. However, the relationship differed depending on the type of personal infection prevention behavior. Specifically, infection control measures against COVID-19 in the workplace may affect personal infection prevention behavior. Conclusion: Implementation of infection control measures in the workplace appears to deepen personal understanding of infection prevention behaviors, and increases awareness of the importance of individual infection prevention behavior and its implementation by all individuals. These findings may be applicable not only to COVID-19 measures but also to responses to other emerging infections and seasonal influenza.","output":"Association between Preventive Measures against Workplace Infection and Preventive Behavior against Personal Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To investigate cases with conjunctival pigmentation originating from sclerotomy sites after 23-gauge microincisional vitrectomy surgery (MIVS).

The authors investigated the incidence and the clinical factors associated with conjunctival pigmentation, including indication of vitrectomy and surgical procedures. RESULTS Eight eyes (4.3%) from 185 eyes showed conjunctival pigmentation after surgery within 7 days postoperatively.

It has previously been shown that there is a convergence of neck proprioceptive and vestibular input within the cerebellum to provide a head-on-body reference frame (Manzoni et al. in Neuroscience 93:1095-1107, 1999). The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is modulated when function of the cerebellar vermis is temporarily depressed. Twenty participants were randomly assigned to a SHAM group (paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation) or a TEST group (continuous theta burst stimulation). Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was applied to standing subjects with their head facing forward or over their left shoulder. Cumulant density traces were established between the SVS and shear force over 180, and the peak amplitude determined the direction of sway. There were no significant changes in sway direction when the head was facing forward for either stimulation (TEST or SHAM; p = 0.889) or when the head was facing over the shoulder for the SHAM condition (p = 0.954). There was, however, a significant change in sway direction when the head was turned with a depressed cerebellum (p = 0.018); from the expected antero-posterior direction, orthogonal to head orientation, to one slightly more mediolateral with respect to the feet. These results suggest the cerebellum plays a role in the integration of input to generate an appropriately directed postural response relative to the head position.","output":"The direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is mediated by the cerebellar vermis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to generate difficulties for authorities and health care professionals worldwide due to enhanced transmissibility and/or immune response evasion.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and is believed to originate from bat, quickly spread into a global pandemic. This RNA virus has a special affinity for porphyrins. It invades the cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and binds to hemoproteins, resulting in a severe systemic inflammatory response, particularly in high ACE-2 organs like the lungs, heart, and kidney, resulting in systemic disease. The inflammatory response manifested by increased cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species results in inhibition of heme oxygenase (HO-1), with a subsequent loss of cytoprotection. This has been seen in other viral illness like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and SARS/MERS. There are a number of medications that have been tried with some showing early clinical promise. This illness disproportionately affects patients with obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease with a baseline excess of cytokines. The majority of the medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. This is further complicated by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, HO-1, ACE, and ACE-2. There is a potential role for HO-1 upregulation to treat/prevent cytokine storm.

Previous studies have determined risk factors on admission only, and included a limited number of predictors. Therefore, using data from the highly granular and multicenter Dutch Data Warehouse, we developed machine learning models to identify risk factors for ICU mortality, ventilator-free days and ICU-free days during the course of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in COVID-19 patients.MethodsThe DDW is a growing electronic health record database of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. All adult ICU patients on IMV were eligible for inclusion. Transfers, patients admitted for less than 24 h, and patients still admitted at time of data extraction were excluded. Predictors were selected based on the literature, and included medication dosage and fluid balance. Multiple algorithms were trained and validated on up to three sets of observations per patient on day 1, 7, and 14 using fivefold nested cross-validation, keeping observations from an individual patient in the same split.ResultsA total of 1152 patients were included in the model. XGBoost models performed best for all outcomes and were used to calculate predictor importance. Using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), age was the most important demographic risk factor for the outcomes upon start of IMV and throughout its course. The relative probability of death across age values is visualized in Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), with an increase starting at 54 years. Besides age, acidaemia, low P/F-ratios and high driving pressures demonstrated a higher probability of death. The PDP for driving pressure showed a relative probability increase starting at 12 cmH2O.ConclusionAge is the most important demographic risk factor of ICU mortality, ICU-free days and ventilator-free days throughout the course of invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. pH, P/F ratio, and driving pressure should be monitored closely over the course of mechanical ventilation as risk factors predictive of these outcomes.","output":"Risk factors for adverse outcomes during mechanical ventilation of 1152 COVID-19 patients: a multicenter machine learning study with highly granular data from the Dutch Data Warehouse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral immune evasion by sequence variation is a significant barrier to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine design and coronavirus disease-2019 diffusion under lockdown are unpredictable with subsequent waves.

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shares the same cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 deaths showed that the lungs had characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type-specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide a route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and in mice treated by lipopolysaccharide. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: The study is based on the analytical materials of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the WHO; the information and analytical data of the GeneralProsecutor's Office of Ukraine, the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and sectoral statistics for the period of 2015-2019, etc. The article is based on dialectical, analytical, synthetic, comparative, statistical, cartographic, and sociological methods of research and the method of potential demography. The theoretical basis of the article is specialized literature on medicine, suicidology, law, sociology, and cartography. RESULTS Results: In Ukraine, the death rate from suicide in recent years averages 1.1% of the total number of deaths. The rate of suicide decline in Ukraine has slowed significantly over the past five years, which is an alarming symptom. There are almost strict proportions between male and female suicide (men commit four out of five suicides). The level of self-harm per 100,000 population of Ukraine remains almost stable, indicating a severe demographic crisis in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are less likely to commit suicide than in European countries. In Ukraine in recent years, contrary to European trends, suicide has dominated among the elderly aged 65+. The number of years of potential life loss for male and female suicides in Ukraine is 103 thousand, and the number of working years is almost 100 thousand. The losses for Ukraine from the unlived life of those who died as a result of suicide in 2019 are almost USD 341 billion.

Blood HCQ concentrations are directly correlated with disease activity in rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. We sought to model how changes in HCQ dosage will best maintain sufficient blood HCQ concentrations for the longest period of time in order to avoid potential future flares. METHODS: A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to predict mean blood HCQ concentrations. Monte Carlo simulations with 10-fold inflated model parameter variance was utilized to assess the impact of variability. RESULTS: Maintenance of 400 mg/d resulted in mean therapeutic whole-blood HCQ concentrations that exceeded 700 ng/ml for 10.5 days, whereas HCQ rationing by reducing the dose by half resulted in the mean concentration remaining above 700 ng/ml for 2.4 days (net gain = 8 days). Variability analysis demonstrates that results may differ at the individual level, dependent on baseline blood HCQ concentrations.

The diagnosis of IBD was confirmed in 44.6% of patients in the pC period, 66.6% in aC and 67.4% in p-aC, (p=0.06). There were no significant differences between the three periods in terms of time from suspicion of the disease to evaluation at the first visit and time to completion of complementary tests. However, there were significant differences in the time between diagnosis and initiation of treatment among the pC group (mean 1.7, SD 1.05 months), in contrast to 4.36 months (SD 2.03) in aC and 3.82 months (SD 1.3) in p-aC (p= 0.05).

The infection is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population. Coronaviruses are viruses with a positive RNA envelope assigned to &#945;, ?, ?3, and ? genera. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the ? genus.

Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological data from 644 patients with 904 disease episodes were collected. When HRV tested positive, strains were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome. HRV was the single respiratory virus detected in 254 disease episodes (28%).

Furthermore, cough, shortness of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with HRV infection. Particularly, patients with HRV-B required extra oxygen. No respiratory symptom, except for oxygen need, was predictive of the presence of HRV. In 22% of HRV-positive disease episodes, HRV infection was hospital acquired. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission within specific wards. In conclusion, the detection of HRV may help in explaining respiratory illness, particular in patients with pulmonary co-morbidities. Identifying HRV provides opportunities for timely implementation of infection control measures to prevent intra-hospital transmission.","output":"The significance of rhinovirus detection in hospitalized children: clinical, epidemiological and virological features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a challenge for healthcare providers in terms of diagnosis, management, and triage of cases requiring admission CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old male with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19, pulse oximetry of 93% on room air, and multifocal pneumonia was risk stratified and safely discharged from the emergency department (ED) despite having moderate risk of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome He had resolution of his symptoms verified by telephone follow-up CONCLUSION: Various risk-stratifying tools and techniques can aid clinicians in identifying COVID-19 patients who can be safely discharged from the ED","output":"Case Report: Disposition of Symptomatic Probable COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on depression and stress-related conditions to discuss possible strategies for the prevention or early management of such conditions.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed chest CT studies from 182 patients with RT-PCR findings positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the pattern, appearance, and predominant distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the extent of involvement in each lobe and in the total lung volume. RESULTS The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n=110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n=112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase (25%), whereas ground-glass opacities were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases. The median severity score was 10 (IQR: 5-13), and the scores increased as the disease progressed. The interobserver agreement (kappa) was 0.92 for the appearance, 0.84 for the distribution, 0.70 for the predominant pattern, and 0.89 for the visual score. CONCLUSION The CT findings in patients with COVID-19 vary with the course of the infection. The proposed visual radiologic score is a simple, reproducible, and reliable tool for assessing lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Chest computed tomography findings in different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reduced physical activity levels in both men and women.

A few in vitro studies confirmed that both drugs exhibited dose dependent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. These observations and the encouraging results from early poorly conducted observational studies created a major hype about the therapeutic potential of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 disease. This was further catalyzed by media and political influences leading to a widespread use of these agents. Subsequent randomized trials revealed lack of efficacy of these agents in improving the outcomes of COVID-19 or in preventing infection in post-exposure prophylaxis studies. Nevertheless, many ongoing trials continue to actively recruit tens of thousands of patients to receive HCQ worldwide. In this perspective, we address the possible mechanisms behind the lack of efficacy and the increased risk of cardiac toxicity of HCQ in COVID-19 disease. For the lack of efficacy, we discuss the fundamental differences of treatment initiation between in vitro and in vivo studies, the pitfalls of the pharmacological calculations of effective blood drug concentrations and related dosing regimens and the possible negative effect of HCQ on the antiviral type-I interferon response. Although it has been repeatedly claimed that HCQ has a longstanding safety track record for many decades in use, we present counterarguments for this contention due to disease-drug and drug-drug interactions.

During infectious disease outbreaks, forecasting models are often developed to inform resource utilization. Pregnancy and delivery pose unique challenges, given the altered maternal immune system and the fact that most American women choose to deliver in the hospital setting. Objective: This study aimed to forecast the first pandemic wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population and the incidence of severe, critical, and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 cases during delivery hospitalization in the United States. Study Design: We used a phenomenological model to forecast the incidence of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States. Incidence data from March 1, 2020, to April 14, 2020, were used to calibrate the generalized logistic growth model. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each week from March 1, 2020, to estimate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 for delivery hospitalizations during the first pandemic wave using the available data estimate. Results: From March 1, 2020, our model forecasted a total of 860,475 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population across the United States for the first pandemic wave. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 during delivery hospitalization is anticipated to be 16,601 (95% confidence interval, 9711-23,491) cases, 3308 (95% confidence interval, 1755-4861) cases of which are expected to be severe, 681 (95% confidence interval, 1324-1038) critical, and 52 (95% confidence interval, 23-81) fatal. Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the United States to at least 18.7 (95% confidence interval, 18.0-19.5) deaths per 100,000 live births as a direct result of coronavirus disease 2019. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant women is expected to severely affect obstetrical care. From March 1, 2020, we forecast 3308 severe and 681 critical cases with about 52 coronavirus disease 2019-related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization for the first pandemic wave in the United States.

Disrupted mucus production is a cardinal feature of chronic respiratory diseases but how this alteration affect interactions between mucins and pathogens is complex and poorly understood. Here, we identify a central and unexpected role for the major airway mucin MUC5AC in pathogenesis of virus-induced exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Virus induction of MUC5AC is augmented in COPD compared to healthy subjects, is enhanced in frequent exacerbators and correlates with inflammation, symptom severity and secondary bacterial infection during exacerbation. MUC5AC is functionally related to inflammation as MUC5AC-deficient (Muc5ac-/-) mice had attenuated rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation whilst exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein administration augmented virus-induced inflammatory responses and bacterial load. Mechanistically, MUC5AC-augmentation of rhinovirus-induced inflammation occurred through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therapeutic suppression of virus-induced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorated exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model. Collectively, these studies demonstrate previously unrecognised pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC during infection and thus highlight a key unforeseen role in driving COPD exacerbation severity.","output":"MUC5AC drives COPD exacerbation severity through amplification of virus-induced airway inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic posed significant challenges to the health service.

Assessment such as routine bloods need to be taken in early pregnancy, anatomic surveys are best done at 20-22 weeks gestation, and births continue regardless of a pandemic.

The high content of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL) in PNSB chromatophore membranes makes these structures potential targets that bind cationic antiseptics. We used the methods of stationary and kinetic fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effect of some cationic antiseptics (chlorhexidine, picloxydine, miramistin, and octenidine at concentrations up to 100 M) on the spectral and kinetic characteristics of the components of the photosynthetic apparatus of Rhodobacter sphaeroides chromatophores. Here we present the experimental data on the reduced efficiency of light energy conversion in the chromatophore membranes isolated from the photosynthetic bacterium Rb. sphaeroides in the presence of cationic antiseptics. The addition of antiseptics did not affect the energy transfer between the light-harvesting LH1 complex and reaction center (RC). However, it significantly reduced the efficiency of the interaction between the LH2 and LH1 complexes. The effect was maximal with 100 M octenidine. It has been proved that molecules of cationic antiseptics, which apparently bind to the heads of negatively charged cardiolipin molecules located in the rings of light-harvesting pigments on the cytoplasmic surface of the chromatophores, can disturb the optimal conditions for efficient energy migration in chromatophore membranes.","output":"The effect of some antiseptic drugs on the energy transfer in chromatophore photosynthetic membranes of purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health problem worldwide.

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has breached the borders of Europe. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand countries at risk for explosive growth and those that are managing the pandemic effectively. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal trend analysis and extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Europe as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: New COVID-19 cases slightly decreased from 158,741 (week 1, January 4-10, 2021) to 152,064 (week 2, January 11-17, 2021), and cumulative cases increased from 22,507,271 (week 1) to 23,890,761 (week 2), with a weekly increase of 1,383,490 between January 10 and January 17. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom had the largest 7-day moving averages for new cases during week 1. During week 2, the 7-day moving average for France and Spain increased. From week 1 to week 2, the speed decreased (37.72 to 33.02 per 100,000), acceleration decreased (0.39 to -0.16 per 100,000), and jerk increased (-1.30 to 1.37 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: The United Kingdom, Spain, and Portugal, in particular, are at risk for a rapid expansion in COVID-19 transmission. An examination of the European region suggests that there was a decrease in the COVID-19 caseload between January 4 and January 17, 2021. Unfortunately, the rates of jerk, which were negative for Europe at the beginning of the month, reversed course and became positive, despite decreases in speed and acceleration. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate was higher during week 2 than during week 1.

RESULTS: A total of 469 HCWs responded to the survey for a high response rate (93.8%). The PSS revealed that 15.8% of the respondents were suffering from high stress levels, 77.2% were suffering from moderate stress levels and 7% with low stress levels. Females and junior frontline staff reported more severe stress levels. Participation on the pandemic team shows significant impact on stress levels. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among HCWs and affects their psychological wellbeing. Designing programs promoting HCWs mental health are crucial and emotional and psychological support strategies should be part of every public health crisis management plan.","output":"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Perceived Stress Scale Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims:","output":"An Observational Study on Glycemic Outcomes, Lifestyle and Psychosocial Health of Patients With Diabetes During Covid-19 Lockdown From Bangalore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination poses a serious challenge to achieving adequate vaccine uptake in the general population.

Hardstyle kettlebell training is characterised by the ballistic two-handed kettlebell swing with outcomes believed to be strongly influenced by swing proficiency. This study examines the effect of four months hardstyle kettlebell training on the force profile of the two-handed kettlebell swing, and peak ground reaction force during a kettlebell deadlift in older adults. These data will help inform healthcare providers and coaches about the use and prescription of kettlebell exercises with older adults. Methods. Five males and five females <70 years of age who participated in the BELL trial were recruited. Two-handed hardstyle swings were performed with 8-16 kg, and deadlifts with 8-32 kg. Ground reaction force (GRF) was obtained from a floor-mounted force platform. Force-time curves (FTCs), peak force, forward force relative to vertical force, rate of force development (RFD), and swing cadence were investigated. Results were compared with the same data variables collected from the participants in an exploratory pre-intervention study, conducted approximately seven months before the present study. Participants completed approximately 90 kettlebell training sessions during a four-month training intervention. Results. Participants used kettlebells to perform 3779 {+/-} 802 swings, 923 {+/-} 251 cleans, 825 {+/-} 309 snatches and 744 {+/-} 178 deadlifts during group-training sessions. Peak ground reaction force during kettlebell swings did not significantly change with any kettlebell weight. There was a significant 3% increase in the magnitude of forward force during 8 kg swings, and a significant 3% decrease in forward force during 16 kg swings. There were large significant improvements in swing cadence with a mean increase of three swings per minute and a small non-significant increase in RFD. Change in kettlebell swing force-time curve profiles were small. Change in peak ground reaction force during deadlifts were moderate to large. All participants increased in grip strength following training, with the magnitude of change greater than the minimum clinically important difference for seven participants. All participants had significant increases in multiple secondary outcomes. Conclusion. Group-based and online kettlebell training is likely to be ineffective for improving the force profile of the hardstyle kettlebell swing in older adults. Insufficiently active older adults engaged in high-volume kettlebell training performed 3-5 times weekly, can however expect to see clinically meaningful improvements in health-related physical fitness irrespective of swing proficiency, and have increased confidence with heavy lifting tasks. Results of this study suggest that beyond safe and competent performance, striving to optimise hardstyle swing technique may provide no additional benefit to clinical outcomes in older adults.","output":"Change in force profile of the hardstyle kettlebell swing in older adults is small following 16 weeks of training and may not be required to improve physical function: findings from the BELL trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that is often undiagnosed or diagnosed late.

In this study, we describe the epidemiology of influenza-like illness in non-elderly adults within the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) by pathogen and hospitalization status. METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ARIC) is a prospective cohort of patients with influenza-like illness within the MHS. Participants between 18 and 65 years of age were identified in outpatient settings between 2012 and 2017, and were excluded if pregnant, if reporting chronic cardiac, respiratory, renal, or neurologic disease, or if on long-term aspirin therapy. Demographics, nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom data were collected; swabs were tested for viral pathogens using a target-enriched multiplex PCR panel (TEM-PCR(TM), Diatherix LLC). Data were analyzed to compare clinical features and risks for hospitalization. RESULTS: 397 participants met inclusion criteria. 34 participants required hospitalization; 363 were outpatients. Median length of hospitalization was 2 days. A virus was identified in 58.4% of outpatients (OP) and 55.9% of inpatients (IP); coronaviruses (63/363), enteroviruses (50/363), and influenza A (73/363) predominated in OP, whereas influenza A predominated among IP (35.3%, 12/34). There were no significant differences between OP and IP in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, or tobacco use. IP were more likely to be obese (BMI 30, 43.3% vs. 20.5%, P = 0.004) and less likely to have received influenza vaccination (45.5% vs. 16.9%, P > 0.001). IP with influenza did not report more severe symptoms (chills, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, myalgia, or headache) on enrollment but were more likely to have fever (temperature 38.0? C) than OP (92.9 vs. 57.1%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Influenza A is the most frequently identified cause of hospitalization among healthy, non-elderly adults with viral respiratory infection. Although age and tobacco use may be risks for viral acquisition, they do not appear to increase the risk of hospitalization in infected patients. Non-obese BMI and influenza vaccination appear protective against hospitalization, even in a relatively healthy cohort. DISCLOSURES: L. Malone, Diatherix Laboratories: Employee, Salary; E.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia during March 7-April 4 (1st period) and October 15-November 12 (2nd period). During the 1st period hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and therapeutic enoxaparin when thrombosis was confirmed were administered; systemic corticosteroids were given in case of severe pneumonia. During the 2nd period dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, remdesivir, thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation were administered according to international recommendations. Patients with respiratory distress on oxygen masks initiated CPAP. Outcomes were: length of hospital stay, all-cause in-hospital mortality and need for intubation. RESULTS: We included 70 patients (75% males) during the 1st and 76 patients (51% males, p = 0.522) during the 2nd period. Prevalence of severe respiratory failure (30% vs. 12%, p = 0.006), and D-dimer >3000 FEU (34% vs. 15%, P = 0.012) were reduced during the 2nd period, while anticoagulation and corticosteroids were more frequently administered (both p < 0.01).

PAS typically involves repeatedly pairing stimulation of a peripheral nerve that innervates an intrinsic hand muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the representation of that muscle in the primary motor cortex. Depending on the timing of the stimuli (interstimulus interval of 25 or 10 ms), PAS leads to either an increase (PAS25) or a decrease (PAS10) in excitability. Both protocols, however, have been associated with an increase in excitability of nearby muscle representations not specifically targeted by PAS. Based on these spillover effects, we hypothesized that an additive, excitability-enhancing effect of PAS25 applied to one muscle representation may be produced by simultaneously applying PAS25 or PAS10 to a nearby representation. In different experiments prototypical PAS25 targeting the left thumb representation [abductor pollicis brevis (APB)] was combined with either PAS25 or PAS10 applied to the left little finger representation [abductor digiti minimi (ADM)] or, in a control experiment, with PAS10 also targeting the APB. In an additional control experiment PAS10 targeted both representations. The plasticity effects were quantified by measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and after PAS. As expected, prototypical PAS25 was associated with an increase in MEP amplitude in the APB muscle. This effect was enhanced when PAS also targeted the ADM representation but only when a different interstimulus timing (PAS10) was used. These results suggest that PAS-induced plasticity is modified by concurrently targeting separate motor cortical representations with excitatory and inhibitory protocols.","output":"Associative plasticity in the human motor cortex is enhanced by concurrently targeting separate muscle representations with excitatory and inhibitory protocols."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in Wuhan state of China in 2019 is the causative agent of deadly disease COVID-19.

Whilst the underlying genetic mechanisms are increasingly understood, the ecological consequences of introgression are relatively less studied, despite their utility for increasing knowledge on how invasion impacts can manifest.

Four populations of native Barbus species (B. plebejus and B. tyberinus) were studied: two purebred and two completely introgressed with alien B. barbus. Across the four populations, differences in their biological traits (growth, body condition and population demographic structure) and trophic ecology (gut content analysis and stable isotope analysis) were tested. While all populations had similar body condition and were dominated by fish up to 2 years of age, the introgressed fish had substantially greater lengths at the same age, with maximum lengths 410C460 mm in hybrids versus 340C360 mm in native purebred barbel. The population characterized by the highest number of introgressed B. barbus alleles (81 %) had the largest trophic niche and a substantially lower trophic position than the other populations through its exploitation of a wider range of resources (e.g. small fishes and plants). These results attest that the genetic introgression of an invasive congener with native species can result in substantial ecological consequences, including the potential for cascading effects.

Objective To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin D3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. Results Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL). Median (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P = .59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P = .62). The difference between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P = .43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P = .30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P = .09).

In Norway, COVID-19 restrictions led to an abrupt shutdown of services from 12 March 2020 also including specialized PD treatments. AIMS The objective of this study was to investigate social and mental distress among patients with PDs during the first COVID-19 wave. DESIGN A survey was distributed after the first COVID-19 wave (June-October 2020) among 1120 patients from 12 PD treatment units. RESULTS The response rate was 12% (N = 133). The survey reflected impairment of occupational activity (53% <50% activity last 6 months), life quality (EQ-5D-VAS: 56, SD 19), and personality functioning (LPFS-BF 12: 81%, 35% avoidant PD, 44% borderline PD) and high levels of depression and anxiety (PHQ-9  10: 84%, GAD-7  10: 68%), 49% with health-related anxiety. Problem increase was reported for anxiety (28%), depression (24%), aggression (23%), substance use (14%), and 70% of parents had more child-care difficulties. Self-destructive behaviors (26%) did not increase. The majority (78%) reported increased or unchanged social isolation and loneliness. Occupational activity declined with negative effects on part-time jobs/rehabilitation. Therapist contact was mainly telephone-based (63%  weekly contact).

Objective The goal of this study was to investigate the links between indoor microbial exposures and pulmonary microbial communities and to document the role of microbial exposures on inflammatory and clinical outcomes of patients with severe asthma (SA). Methods Fifty-five SA patients from the national COBRA cohort were enrolled for analyzing their indoor microbial flora through the use of electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs). Among these patients, 22 were able to produce sputa during stable or pulmonary exacerbation periods and had complete pairs of EDC and sputum samples, both collected and analysed. We used amplicon targeted metagenomics to compare microbial communities from EDC and sputum samples of patients according to type 2 (T2)-asthma endotypes. Results Compared to patients with T2-low SA, patients with T2-high SA exhibited an increase in bacterial alpha-diversity and a decrease in fungal alpha-diversity of their indoor microbial floras, the latter being significantly correlated with FeNO levels. The beta-diversity of the EDC mycobiome significantly clustered according to T2 endotypes. Moreover, the proportion of fungal taxa in common between sputum and EDC samples was significantly higher when patients exhibited acute exacerbation. Conclusion These results illustrated, for the first time, a potential association between the indoor mycobiome and clinical features of SA patients, which should renew interest in deciphering the interactions between indoor environment, fungi, and host in asthma.","output":"Type 2-high asthma is associated with a specific indoor mycobiome and microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Finding effective therapeutics for COVID-19 continues to be an urgent need, especially considering use context limitations and cost of currently approved agents.

Methods: In this pilot, randomized, open label trial conducted in Nigeria, patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive standard of care (SoC) or SoC plus 14-day course of nitazoxanide (1000 mg b.i.d.) and atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg od) and followed through day 28. Study endpoints included time to clinical improvement, SARS-CoV-2 viral load change, and time to complete symptoms resolution. Safety and pharmacokinetics of nitazoxanide active metabolite, tizoxanide, were also evaluated. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04459286).

METHODS A total of 443 adult patients presenting at the Emergency Department with community-acquired pneumonia were included in a prospective etiologic study. Patients with acute Q fever pneumonia were identified by PCR and/or serology. Patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, pneumonia severity and inflammation markers were assessed upon presentation. Duration of symptoms, prior therapy and length of hospital stay were retrieved from the hospital information system. RESULTS In all, 40 patients with acute Q fever pneumonia were identified. Of these, 29 were seronegative and 11 seropositive at presentation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was the only inflammation marker increased in all seronegative and seropositive patients but no significant difference was observed between groups. In seronegative patients, hypophosphatemia was more common (p=0.01), and length of hospital stay was longer (p=0.02). However, there was no significant difference in pneumonia severity index.

We find that uncertainty inhibits the export of firms, but GVC participation can alleviate the negative impact of uncertainty, which is verified through empirical analysis. Additionally, mechanism analysis reveals that GVC participation plays a moderating role through product diversity, market diversity, cost-saving effects, and quality-improving effects. This study demonstrates that in the absence of serious adverse events, GVC is highly efficient.

This may adversely affect both surgical training and postoperative management. Since it poses no risk to a patient, simulation training may be a solution these problems. COVID-19 requires social distancing which has created a negative impact on the simulation educational environment. To date, there is only limited research examining whether skills are evaluated objectively and equally in simulation training, especially in microsurgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze the objectivity and equality of simulation evaluation results conducted in a contest format. Methods: : A nationwide recruitment process was conducted to select study participants. Participants were recruited from a pool of qualified physicians with less than 10 years experience. In this study, the simulation procedure consisted of incising a 1 mm thick artificial blood vessel and suturing it with a 10-0 thread using a surgical microscope. To evaluate the simulation procedures, a scoring chart was developed with a maximum of 5 points each for eight different evaluation criteria. Five neurosurgical supervisors from different hospitals were asked to use this scoring chart to grade the simulation procedures Results: : Initially, we planned to have the neurosurgical supervisors score the simulation procedure by direct observation. However, due to COVID-19 some study participants were unable to attend. Thus requiring some simulation procedures to be scored by video review. A total of 14 trainees participated in the study. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient among the scorers was 0.99, indicating a strong correlation. There was no statistically significant difference between the scores from the video review and direct observation judgments. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the scores for some criteria. For the eight criteria, individual scorers assigned scores in a consistent pattern. However, this pattern differed between scorers indicating that some scorers were more lenient than others.

METHOD: BEYNEX computerized cognitive training (CCT) has been used in android and ios environments as a smartphone and tablet application in July 2020. In this application, the scores obtained from the gamified cognitive exercises presented on the internet are presented in 8 different cognitive parameters in graphics (Memory, Visual Perception, Speed, Problem\\\\solving, Flexibility, Attention, Language Skills, Arithmetic). All exercises designed within the parameters used by clinicians and are completely unique. Every 2 weeks, users are asked questions that evaluate themselves and their daily life activities. The data of the user, who scores between 1 and 10 for each question, is also stored graphically. RESULT: The BEYNEX/Turkey data used in this study belong to the last four months of 2020 when quarantine measures are gradually increased. Data of an average of 250 people aged 20 to 85 were analyzed in a total of 4 months between September / December 2021. When the monthly data of the users were compared in the 4\\\\month period with quarantine, there was no statistical difference in 8 different cognitive parameters (Figure 1) (Table 1). However, there were important statistical differences in their responses to the questions they evaluated themselves (Figure 2) (Table 2).

METHODS: Between 1st January 2009 and 15th June 2019, we obtained the first WGS isolate from every patient resident in a postcode district covered by Birmingham's centralised tuberculosis service. Data on patients sex, country of birth, social risk-factors, anatomical locus of disease, and strain lineage were collected. Poisson harmonic regression was used to assess seasonal variation in case load and a mixed-effects multivariable Cox proportionate hazards model was used to assess risk factors for a future case arising in clusters defined by a 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) threshold, and by 12 SNPs in a sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: 511/1653 (31%) patients were genomically clustered with another. A seasonal variation in diagnoses was observed, peaking in spring, but only among clustered cases. Risk-factors for a future clustered case included UK-birth (aHR=203 (95%CI 135C304), p < 0001), infectious (pulmonary/laryngeal/miliary) tuberculosis (aHR=308 (95%CI 198-478), p < 0001), and M. tuberculosis lineage 3 (aHR=191 (95%CI 103C356), p = 0041) and 4 (aHR=227 (95%CI 121C426), p = 0011), vs. lineage 1. Similar results pertained to 12 SNP clusters, for which social risk-factors were also significant (aHR 172 (95%CI 102C293), p = 0044). There was marked heterogeneity in transmission patterns between postcode districts.

RESULTS Among 294 598 included women, 42 962 (15%) had a CD in their first pregnancy while 251 636 (85%) had a VD. Compared with the second delivery of mothers with a previous VD, the adjusted OR (adjOR), for stillbirth in the second pregnancy following a previous CD was 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73; for perinatal death the adjOR was 1.42 (1.22 to 1.73) and for neonatal death 1.13 (0.86 to 1.49). Among children who survived the neonatal period, the adjOR for cerebral palsy was 1.27 (0.99 to 1.64).

When news media uses social media as one of their platforms, popular contents would be beneficial for the media. Research has shown that contents with strong high-arousal emotions are more likely to capture a larger amount of interest on the Internet and are more likely to be disseminated. Despite the importance of emotions in the popularity of a content on the Internet, the research regarding the tweet popularity has not included emotions in the prediction models. This paper investigates whether or not emotions (compared to the binary sentiment of positive and negative) have the potential to predict tweet popularity regarding Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) news in various news media worldwide. First, the tweets are preprocessed by removing the symbols. Then, the emotions in each tweet is quantified based on a sentiment lexicon called NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon. Finally, the correlation between emotions and popularity (Retweet) is computed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Based on the tweets from 20 Twitter accounts of various news media worldwide, several findings are obtained. First, the numbers of Like and Retweet are highly linearly correlated.

Notably, in 40% of patients, constitutive STAT3 activation is due to STAT3 activating mutations, whereas in 60% this is unknown. As miRNAs are amongst the most potent regulators in health and disease, we hypothesized that aberrant miRNA expression could contribute to dysregulation of these pathways. miRNA sequencing in T-LGL leukemia cases and aged-matched healthy control TEMRA cells revealed overexpression of miR-181a. Furthermore, geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) of downregulated targets of miR-181a implicated involvement in regulating STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. Flow cytometric analyses showed increased SOCS3+ and DUSP6+ T-LGL cells upon miR-181a inhibition. In addition, miR-181a-transfected human CD8+ T cells showed increased basal STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. By using TL1, a human T-LGL cell line, we could show that miR-181a is an actor in T-LGL leukemia, driving STAT3 activation by SOCS3 inhibition and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by DUSP6 inhibition and verified this mechanism in an independent cell line. In addition, miR-181a inhibition resulted in a higher sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis.

Viruses exist in complex microbial environments, and recent studies have revealed both synergistic and antagonistic effects of specific bacterial taxa on viral prevalence and infectivity. We set out to test whether specific bacterial communities predict SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in a hospital setting. METHODS: We collected 972 samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, their health care providers, and hospital surfaces before, during, and after admission. We screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, characterized microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and used these bacterial profiles to classify SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with a random forest model. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of surfaces from COVID-19 patient rooms had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, although infectivity was not assessed. The highest prevalence was in floor samples next to patient beds (39%) and directly outside their rooms (29%). Although bed rail samples more closely resembled the patient microbiome compared to floor samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected less often in bed rail samples (11%). SARS-CoV-2 positive samples had higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity in both human and surface samples and higher biomass in floor samples. 16S microbial community profiles enabled high classifier accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 status in not only nares, but also forehead, stool, and floor samples. Across these distinct microbial profiles, a single amplicon sequence variant from the genus Rothia strongly predicted SARS-CoV-2 presence across sample types, with greater prevalence in positive surface and human samples, even when compared to samples from patients in other intensive care units prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These results contextualize the vast diversity of microbial niches where SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected and identify specific bacterial taxa that associate with the viral RNA prevalence both in the host and hospital environment.

METHODS: A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2-3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19-specific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients.

In the months following discharge, patients were invited to participate in a survey and fill the RAND-36 questionnaire. Patients characteristics and comorbidities were extracted from electronic charts. RESULTS: Among 66 COVID-19 participants, the median age was 58.5 (IQR 49.8C68.3), 56.1% were female, and 36.4% were obese. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR 4C10).

They may consider it as a last resort option if alternative control measures fail to reduce transmission. AIM: We developed a modelling framework to ascertain the use of lockdown to ensure intensive care unit (ICU) capacity does not exceed a peak target defined by policymakers. METHODS: We used a deterministic compartmental model describing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the trajectories of COVID-19 patients in healthcare settings, accounting for age-specific mixing patterns and an increasing probability of severe outcomes with age. The framework is illustrated in the context of metropolitan France. RESULTS: The daily incidence of ICU admissions and the number of occupied ICU beds are the most robust indicators to decide when a lockdown should be triggered. When the doubling time of hospitalisations estimated before lockdown is between 8 and 20 days, lockdown should be enforced when ICU admissions reach 3.0C3.7 and 7.8C9.5 per million for peak targets of 62 and 154 ICU beds per million (4,000 and 10,000 beds for metropolitan France), respectively.

PubMed, Cochrane Database, Medline, and Google Scholar were searched for eligible trials published after 01/01/2010, involving populations with at least one CVD risk factor. Primary outcome was change in CVD risk score (e.g. QRISK3) between baseline and follow-up. Meta-analysis was undertaken using Revman5/STATA using random-effects modelling. Cochrane RoB-2 tool determined risk-of-bias. 6 randomised controlled trials from 36 retrieved articles (16.7%) met inclusion criteria, involving 1,157 patients treated with DHIs alongside usual care, and 1,127 patients offered usual care only (control group). Meta-analysis using random-effects model in STATA showed an inconclusive effect for DHIs as effective compared to usual care (Mean Difference, MD -0.76, 95% CI -1.72, 0.20), with moderate certainty (GRADEpro).

Burden increases when new documentation elements are added, but unnecessary elements are not systematically identified and removed. OBJECTIVES Reducing the burden of nursing documentation during the inpatient admission process was a key objective for a group of nurse experts who collaboratively identified essential clinical data elements to be documented by nurses in the EHR. METHODS Twelve health care organizations used a data-driven process to evaluate inpatient admission assessment data elements to identify which elements were consistently deemed essential to patient care. Processes used for the twelve organizations to reach consensus included identifying: (1) data elements that were truly essential, (2) which data elements were explicitly required during the admission process, and (3) data elements that must be documented by a registered nurse (RN). RESULT The result was an Admission Patient History Essential Clinical Dataset (APH ECD) that reduced the amount of admission documentation content by an average of 48.5%. Early adopters experienced an average reduction of more than two minutes per admission history documentation session and an average reduction in clicks of more than 30%. CONCLUSION The creation of the essential clinical dataset is an example of combining evidence from nursing practice within the EHR with a set of predefined guiding principles to decrease documentation burden for nurses. Establishing essential documentation components for the adult admission history and intake process ensures the efficient use of bedside nurses' time by collecting the right (necessary) information collected by the right person at the right time during the patient's hospital stay.

We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all mutations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that usually accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis.

Results: A total of 192 patients in the cohort had data available for blood type and among them 47 patients had blood group A (24.5%) vs 42% nationally, 48 had blood group B (25.0%) vs 10%, 9 had blood group AB (4.7%) vs 4%, and 88 had blood group O (45.8%) vs 44%. Death and intubation were not associated with any blood group type (p=0.424 and p=0.144, respectively). Values for inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer, WBC, and ferritin) were not significantly different between the different blood groups (p=0.654, p=0.357, p=0.060, p=0.083, and p=0.706, respectively). Conclusions: When compared to data from the American Red Cross, blood group B was more prevalent in our cohort compared to the general population of the US. There was no association between blood group type and death or mechanical ventilation. We noted a trend towards higher D-dimer levels and WBC counts in patients with blood group B, but overall, there were no significant differences between inflammatory markers and blood group types among critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and blood type in Atlanta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The number of people in South Africa with chronic conditions is a challenge to the health system. In response to the coronavirus infection, health services in Cape Town introduced home delivery of medication by community health workers. In planning for the future, they requested a scoping review of alternative mechanisms for delivery of medication to patients in primary health care in South Africa. METHODS: Databases were systematically searched using a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies from the last 10 years. A methodological guideline for conducting scoping reviews was followed. A standardised template was used to extract data and compare study characteristics and findings. Data was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 4253 publications were identified and 26 included. Most publications were from the last 5 years (n = 21), research (n = 24), Western Cape (n = 15) and focused on adherence clubs (n = 17), alternative pick-up-points (n = 14), home delivery (n = 5) and HIV (n = 17). The majority of alternative mechanisms were supported by a centralised dispensing and packaging system. New technology such as smart lockers and automated pharmacy dispensing units have been piloted. Patients benefited from these alternatives and had improved adherence. Available evidence suggests alternative mechanisms were cheaper and more beneficial than attending the facility to collect medication. CONCLUSION: A mix of options tailored to the local context and patient choice that can be adequately managed by the system would be ideal. More economic evaluations are required of the alternatives, particularly before going to scale and for newer technology.","output":"Alternative mechanisms for delivery of medication in South Africa: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ocular pain is a common complaint which forces the patient to seek immediate medical attention. It is the primeval first response of the body to any severe condition of the eye such as trauma, infections and inflammation. The pain can be due to conditions directly affecting the eye and ocular adnexa; or indirect which would manifest as referred pain from other organ structures such as the central nervous system. Paradoxically, there are several minor and non-sight threatening conditions, which also leads to ocular pain and does not merit urgent hospital visits. In this perspective, we intend to provide guidelines to the practising ophthalmologist for teleconsultation when a patient complains of pain with focus on how to differentiate the various diagnoses that can be managed over teleconsultation and those requiring emergency care in the clinic. These guidelines can decrease unnecessary hospital visits, which is the need of the hour in the pandemic era and also beyond. Patients who are under quarantine and those who are unable to travel would be benefitted, and at the same time, the burden of increased patient load in busy hospital systems can be reduced.","output":"Differential diagnosis of acute ocular pain: Teleophthalmology during COVID-19 pandemic - A perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Kidney biomarkers improve early and specific AKI detection and also poor outcomes in different clinical contexts. Kidney disease is an important risk factor for poor outcomes in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate association of early levels of kidney biomarkers with poor outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: This is a prospective study conducted at the Instituto Dr. Jose Frota Hospital, an important public reference hospital for COVID-19 in northeast Brazil. Medical records with clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory and outcomes were collected. The urinary NGAL, KIM-1, MCP-1 and nephrin were the kidney biomarkers quantified at hospital admission. ELISA assays were used for analysis and biomarkers urinary concentrations were adjusted for urinary creatinine. Data were expressed as mean standard deviation or median. RESULTS: A total of 69 patients collected urine and were included in this study. Male gender was predominant (65%) and mean age was 5619 years. Regarding outcomes, the group had 62% of death, 92% of ICU admission and 65% of invasive respiratory support in ICU. Urinary NGAL and MCP-1 were significantly elevated in patients that needed invasive respiratory support in comparison with non-invasive support: uNGAL (median=104 [IQR=74-153] vs 71 [31-79] ng/mg-Cr, p=0.013), and uMCP-1 (3055 [1127-5008] vs 1315 [574-2127] pg/mg-Cr, p=0.027). Urinary nephrin and KIM-1 was also elevated, however with no statistical significance. Moreover, all urinary biomarkers were higher in ICU admission group and death group, but with p>0.05. In ROC curve analysis for prediction of invasive respiratory support, uNGAL had AUC=0.696 (0.565-0.827),p=0.012 and cut-off=78 ng/mg-Cr; uMCP-1 had AUC=0.676 (0.539-0.813), p=0.023 and cut-off=1354 pg/mg-Cr. In survival analysis, patients with uNGAL >78 ng/mg-Cr had worse prognosis and died more quickly (19 vs 48 days, log-rank test; p=0.01). In patients with uMCP-1 >1354 pg/mg-Cr, they also died more quickly, but with no significance (25 vs 48 days, log-rank test; p=0.08). CONCLUSION: Urinary biomarkers NGAL and MCP-1 quantified at hospital admission were associated with poor outcomes, mostly with needed of invasive respiratory support in ICU.

Seemingly healthy imported camels are responsible for the ingress of serious diseases into Egypt. A striking example of this concerning public health globally is the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which causes case fatalities of over 34%. Here, we determined the seroepidemiological situation of the MERS-CoV in imported camels and their traders in Upper Egypt. METHODOLOGY: Sera of sixty-three dromedaries and twenty-eight camel traders were recruited (January 2015-December 2016). The age, gender, and sampling locality of each sampled camel and human were obtained. Semi-quantitative anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISAs which utilize the purified spike protein domain S1 antigen of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV S1) were used to detect specific IgG antibodies against the virus. RESULTS: The data showed that 58.73% of imported camels and 25% of traders had antibodies specific to MERS-CoV. Interestingly, like seroreactive camels, all seropositive humans were apparently healthy without any history of developing severe respiratory disease in the 14 days prior to sampling. Having specific antibodies among the examined camel sera was significantly different (P < 0.0001) in relation to various sampling localities, gender and age groups. In contrast, the seropositivity rate of MERS-CoV IgG in humans did not differ significantly by any of the studied factors. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides the first serological evidence of occupational exposure of humans to MERS-CoV in Africa. Additionally, it reports that imported camels could be implicated in introducing MERS-CoV into Egypt. Accordingly, application of strict control measures to camel importation is a priority.","output":"Seroprevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus in dromedaries and their traders in upper Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a new model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework to project mortality at both national and subnational levels based on sparse or missing data.

In this study, the authors aim to present the findings from the major clinical trials on three nonpharmacologic interventions-hypnosis, virtual/augmented reality, and yoga-as supplements to conventional pain regimens for burn management. METHODS: A computerized literature search was conducted of the PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases in April of 2020. The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. The protocol was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses, and it was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews of the National Institute for Health Research. RESULTS: The search yielded 254 articles from 1955 to 2020. Fifty-eight studies met the authors' inclusion criteria. Yoga reduced cognitive and somatic anxiety in burn survivors, and improved body image. Virtual reality is effective in pain reduction in both the pediatric and the adult burn population, and in faster burn wound reepithelialization. Hypnosis has similar results regarding reducing pain quality and anxiety in burn patients undergoing burn wound care and dressing changes but was not found to significantly accelerate the healing process. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpharmacologic interventions are not a substitute for conventional analgesics; however, they could help patients have better control over their pain, greater self-esteem, and less postburn traumatic experiences.

For network meta-analysis (NMA), the contribution of direct (and indirect) evidence is easily obtained from the diagonal elements of a hat matrix. It is, however, not fully clear how to generalize this to the percentage contribution of each study to a NMA estimate. METHODS: We define the importance of each study for a NMA estimate by the reduction of the estimates variance when adding the given study to the others. An equivalent interpretation is the relative loss in precision when the study is left out. Importances are values between 0 and 1. An importance of 1 means that the study is an essential link of the pathway in the network connecting one of the treatments with another. RESULTS: Importances can be defined for two-stage and one-stage NMA. These numbers in general do not add to one and thus cannot be interpreted as percentage contributions. After briefly discussing other available approaches, we question whether it is possible to obtain unique percentage contributions for NMA. CONCLUSIONS: Importances generalize the concept of weights in pairwise meta-analysis in a natural way. Moreover, they are uniquely defined, easily calculated, and have an intuitive interpretation.

It is important to recognize that this classification is not absolute as genetic variants in complement genes have been identified in patients with secondary TMA, and distinguishing complement/genetic-mediated TMA from secondary causes of TMA can be challenging and lead to potentially harmful delays in treatment. In this review, we focus on data supporting the involvement of complement in aHUS and in secondary forms of TMA associated with malignant hypertension, drugs, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy and infections. In aHUS, genetic variants in complement genes are found in up to 60% of patients, whereas in the secondary forms the finding of genetic defects is variable, ranging from almost 60% in TMA associated with malignant hypertension to less than 10% in drug-induced TMA.

To evaluate medical student perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic, an anonymous online survey was distributed to medical students, primarily in the Northeastern United States. In the sample of 232 students, there were significant differences between students in different class years when assessing moral obligations to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.002). A higher percentage of first and second year medical students (pre-clinical training, around 48%) felt that healthcare students are morally obligated to assist as compared to third and fourth year students (clinical training, 30.43% of third years and 23.19% of fourth years). In all class years, the majority said they would regret their decision if they had chosen not to study medicine (62.32% to 79.31%) and most students did not feel their motivation to become a physician had been decreased (84.78% to 87.50%).

However, for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), concerns have been raised regarding the oncologic safety (i.e., radical resection, lymph node retrieval, and survival) of MIDP, as compared to ODP. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial comparing MIDP and ODP in PDAC regarding oncological safety is warranted. We hypothesize that the microscopically radical resection (R0) rate is non-inferior for MIDP, as compared to ODP. METHODS/DESIGN DIPLOMA is an international randomized controlled, patient- and pathologist-blinded, non-inferiority trial performed in 38 pancreatic centers in Europe and the USA. A total of 258 patients with an indication for elective distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy because of proven or highly suspected PDAC of the pancreatic body or tail will be randomly allocated to MIDP (laparoscopic or robot-assisted) or ODP in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the microscopically radical resection margin (R0, distance tumor to pancreatic transection and posterior margin  1 mm), which is assessed using a standardized histopathology assessment protocol. The sample size is calculated with the following assumptions: 5% one-sided significance level (), 80% power (1-), expected R0 rate in the open group of 58%, expected R0 resection rate in the minimally invasive group of 67%, and a non-inferiority margin of 7%. Secondary outcomes include time to functional recovery, operative outcomes (e.g., blood loss, operative time, and conversion to open surgery), other histopathology findings (e.g., lymph node retrieval, perineural- and lymphovascular invasion), postoperative outcomes (e.g., clinically relevant complications, hospital stay, and administration of adjuvant treatment), time and site of disease recurrence, survival, quality of life, and costs. Follow-up will be performed at the outpatient clinic after 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postoperatively.

We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States). Methods Standardized survey responses were collected from 45,928 individuals between June 2020 and January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education level. Findings We document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67% (Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Interpretation Given high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and emphasize safety and efficacy.

However, little is known about the current status of breastfeeding practice, as well as the trends in breastfeeding practices during recent years. We examined global prevalence of the World Health Organization (WHO) feeding practices in 57 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and time trends since 2000 for 44 selected countries. METHODS: We included 57 eligible LMICs that had completed data on breastfeeding and complementary feeding in 2010C2018 from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for examining current feeding status. We further selected 44 LMICs that had two standard DHS surveys between 2000 and 2009 and 2010C2018 to examine time trends of feeding status. We calculated global, regional, and national weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for five breastfeeding indicators and two complementary feeding indicators. FINDINGS: In 57 LMICs during 2010C2018, global weighted prevalence was 51.9% for early initiation of breastfeeding, 45.7% for exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, 32.0% for exclusive breastfeeding at 4C5 months, 83.1% for continued breastfeeding at 1 year, 56.2% for continued breastfeeding at 2 years, 14.9% for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods under 6 months, and 63.1% for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6C8 months. Eastern Mediterranean (34.5%) and European regions (43.7%) (vs. South-East Asia/Western Pacific (55.2%)), and upper middle-income countries (38.4%) (vs. lower middle-income countries (47.4%)) had poorer performance of exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months. South-East Asia/Western Pacific regions (51.0%) (vs. other regions (68.3%-84.1%)) and low-income (66.4%) or lower middle-income countries (58.2%) (vs. upper middle-income countries (81.7%)) had lower prevalence of introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6C8 months. In 44 selected LMICs from 2000 to 2009 to 2010C2018, total weighted prevalence presented an increase of 10.1% for exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, but a 1.7% decrease for continued breastfeeding at 1 year. Over this period, the Eastern Mediterranean region had a 5.3% decrease of exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, and the European region had a 2.0% increase for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods under 6 months. The prevalence of introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6C8 months decreased in South-East Asia/Western Pacific region by 15.2%, and in lower middle-income countries by 24.4%.

RASi can theoretically antagonize the potential influence of angiotensin II (Ang II) on ACE2. However, while Ang II decreases the ACE2 levels in cultured cells, there is little evidence that supports this phenomenon in living animals. In this study, we tested whether Ang II or Ang II combined with its antagonist would alter the ACE2 and other molecules associated with the infection of SARS-CoV-2.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search and evaluation of new treatment modalities and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. METHODS: We included 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Denmark between April 3rd and July 9th 2020, at least 14 days after COVID-19 symptom recovery. The participants had experienced a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to severe. We collected plasma, serum and PBMC's for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response by Meso Scale analysis including other coronavirus strains, ACE2 competition, IgA ELISA, pseudovirus neutralization capacity, and dextramer flow cytometry analysis of CD8+ T cells. The immunological outcomes were compared amongst severity groups within the cohort, and 10 pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. FINDINGS: We report broad serological profiles within the cohort, detecting antibody binding to other human coronaviruses. 202(>99%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 193(95%) individuals. A significant positive correlation (r=0.7804) between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. Further, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 95 of 106(90%) HLA-A2+ individuals.

For droplet radii in the range 70 nm < R < 60 m, evaporation can be described in the stagnant-flow approximation and is diffusion-limited. Analytical equations are presented for the droplet evaporation rate, the time-dependent droplet size, and the sedimentation time, including evaporation cooling and solute osmotic-pressure effects. Evaporation makes the time for initially large droplets to sediment much longer and thus significantly increases the viral air load. Using recent estimates for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sputum and droplet production rates while speaking, a single infected person that constantly speaks without a mouth cover produces a total steady-state air load of more than 10(4) virions at a given time. In a midsize closed room, this leads to a viral inhalation frequency of at least 2.5 per minute. Low relative humidity, as encountered in airliners and inside buildings in the winter, accelerates evaporation and thus keeps initially larger droplets suspended in air. Typical air-exchange rates decrease the viral air load from droplets with an initial radius larger than 20 m only moderately.","output":"Mechanisms of Airborne Infection via Evaporating and Sedimenting Droplets Produced by Speaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, it is essential that most people respect the measures in place so as to keep the health crisis at bay.

Face-to-face teaching was replaced by online delivery. This presented challenges for nursing programmes due to the hands-on teaching requirements and clinical placements. Questions were raised around students' resilience and stress in the face of adversity. This study explored undergraduate nursing students' resilience, challenges experienced, and supports utilized during the pandemic. Convenience sampling recruited students from one nursing programme (n = 340). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) examined resilience scores through non-parametric analysis. Narrative responses were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. 121 surveys (40.3%) were completed. Most participants were from second year (n = 77, 63.6%). The difference in median resilience scores among employed participants was statistically significant (P = 0.029) and higher than the unemployed. The median scores of students working in nursing-related roles were higher than others. Median resilience score across all year levels was 70 (IQR = 62-80), in the lowest score range. Major themes identified were fear of the virus, isolation, and mental health problems. The coping strategies identified were developing daily routines, staying connected, and establishing self-help techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients' diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital's database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28-29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital.

The closure of outpatient addiction clinics, cessation of harm-reduction services, and lack of access to support groups have all been attributed to worsening outcomes for patients with OUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most concerningly, emerging evidence points to accelerated rates of overdose deaths. In Los Angeles, a city disproportionately affected by high rates of COVID-19, chronic housing insecurity, and substance use disorder, the Department of Public Health reported a 48% increase in accidental drug overdose deaths during the first five months of the pandemic. In March of 2020, a state of emergency was declared for COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders were issued. These events were associated with a sharp reduction in total ED visits. However, with the profound disruption in usual sources of care and support for people with substance use disorders, emergency departments (EDs) remained a critical access point for these patients. Methods: We examined all visits to public safety-net hospital EDs in Los Angeles County. We considered OUD-related ED visits as those which included any of the following: visits with a discharge diagnosis related to OUD, patients who received buprenorphine or naloxone while in the ED, and visits where a prescription for buprenorphine or naloxone was given on discharge. We performed a logistic regression to examine patient characteristics of opiate use disorder-related visits from April 2019-Feb 2020 compared with April 2020-Feb 2021. Results: Overall, there was a 22% increased odds of an ED visit being related to OUD when we compared pre- and post- COVID shutdown periods in Los Angeles. Visit acuity levels increased across all ESI scores. There was a statistically significant increase in the predicted probability of OUD visits for black and Hispanic patients of 17% and 25% respectively compared to pre-COVID levels. Patients were more likely to present for OUD-related encounters if they were publicly insured, uninsured, or brought in by ambulance. Admitted patients were four times more likely to have an OUD-related ED visit on presentation. Conclusions: Rates of OUD-related ED visits increased during COVID-related shutdowns. These increases were most pronounced among black and Hispanic patients and those with no insurance or publicly funded insurance plans. Patients admitted to the hospital had higher odds of OUD-related complaints. This reinforces the importance of the emergency department as a safety net resource for the most vulnerable patients suffering from OUD during the pandemic and highlights the opportunity to address these disparities with ED-based interventions.","output":"28EMF The Opioid Epidemic Meets the Coronavirus Pandemic: Rates and Patient Characteristics of Emergency Department Visits for Opiate Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Los Angeles County Public Hospital System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: health measures as the global activity limitation indicator (GALI) or self-rated health (SRH) allow to quantify and monitor the health of the population. The GALI is widely used in the European Union; however, evidence of its construct validity is still limited. We examine whether the GALI reflects disability in specific living contexts such as self-care, domestic life and work activity, whether it does so consistently across gender and age and its added value concerning SRH. METHODS: We used the subsample of adults aged 16-64 years (N = 15 934) from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain and analyzed the data with logistic regression models using the GALI and SRH as response variables. RESULTS: The GALI was strongly and significantly associated with the three measures of disability: self-care (OR = 22.8, 95% CI: 15.9-32.7), domestic life (OR = 16.3, 95% CI: 13.6-19.5) and work activity (e.g. impossibility to work: OR = 41.9, 95% CI: 30.3-57.8; prolonged sick leave: OR = 10.7, 95% CI: 9-12.7). There were significant interactions with age on all three disability measures and with the gender on one (domestic life), although they were small. SRH was also strongly associated with all three disability measures, but to a lesser extent than the GALI. CONCLUSIONS: The GALI reflects well and better than SRH, disability in self-care, domestic life and work activity.

With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. METHODS: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. RESULTS: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took &#8805;10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. CONCLUSION: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management.

OBJECTIVES To describe types and prevalence of occupational disruptions and exposure to COVID-19, and their impacts on mental health, moral distress, coping strategies, and help-seeking behaviours of Australian nurses. DESIGN A cross-sectional online anonymous survey distributed amongst Australian healthcare workers between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. METHODS Data was collected on demographics, workplace disruption, personal relationships, and mental health. Predictors of mental health impacts and coping strategies were identified through multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS 7845 complete responses were returned, of which 3082 (39.3%) were from nurses and 4763 (60.7%) were from all other professions ('other HCWs'). Occupational disruption was common, with nurses specifically reporting additional paid hours (p<0.001). Nurses were exposed to, and infected with, COVID-19 more frequently than other HCWs (p<0.001) and were more likely to report concerns around stigmatisation from the broader community (p<0.001). Symptoms of mental illness (anxiety, depression, PTSD and burnout) were significantly more prevalent in nurses than other HCWs, despite both groups scoring high on resilience. Common predictors of mental health symptoms included exposure to COVID-19 and worsening of personal relationships. Nurses reported a variety of coping strategies and were more likely than other HCWs to increase alcohol consumption. Engagement with formal support services was low for both groups. Personal and professional predictors for coping strategy use were identified. CONCLUSIONS Urgent action is needed to address staff shortages and burnout which have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

Dual-users are at increased risk of fragmented care and adverse outcomes and often do not receive necessary follow-up care addressing social determinants of health (SDOH). We developed a Veteran-informed social worker-led Advanced Care Coordination (ACC) program to decrease fragmented care and provide longitudinal care coordination addressing SDOH for dual-users accessing non-VA emergency departments (EDs) in two communities. METHODS: ACC had four core components: 1. Notification from non-VA ED providers of Veterans ED visit; 2. ACC social worker completed a comprehensive assessment with the Veteran to identify SDOH needs; 3. Clinical intervention addressing SDOH up to 90 days post-ED discharge; and 4. Warm hand-off to Veterans VA primary care team. Data was documented in our program database. We performed propensity matching between a control group and ACC participants between 4/10/2018 C 4/1/2020 (N- = 161). A joint survival model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique was employed for 30-day outcomes. We performed Difference-In-Difference analyses on number of ED visits, admissions, and primary care physician (PCP) visits 120-day pre/post discharge. RESULTS: When compared to a matched control group ACC had significantly lower risk of 30-day ED visits (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.61, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = (0.42, 0.92)) and a higher probability of PCP visits at 13C30 days post-ED visit (HR = 1.5, 95% CI = (1.01, 2.22)).

While a number of risk assessment methodologies and software tools are available, it is most often the case that one must, at least, integrate them into a holistic approach that combines several appropriate risk sources as input to risk mitigation tools. In addition, cyber risk assessment primarily investigates cyber risks as the consequence of vulnerabilities and threats that threaten assets of the investigated infrastructure. In fact, cyber risk assessment is decoupled from privacy impact assessment, which aims to detect privacy-specific threats and assess the degree of compliance with data protection legislation. Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is conducted in a proactive manner during the design phase of a system, combining processing activities and their inter-dependencies with assets, vulnerabilities, real-time threats and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that may occur during the dynamic life-cycle of systems. In this paper, we propose a cyber and privacy risk management toolkit, called AMBIENT (Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit) that addresses the above challenges by implementing and integrating three distinct software tools. AMBIENT not only assesses cyber and privacy risks in a thorough and automated manner but it also offers decision-support capabilities, to recommend optimal safeguards using the well-known repository of the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls. To the best of our knowledge, AMBIENT is the first toolkit in the academic literature that brings together the aforementioned capabilities. To demonstrate its use, we have created a case scenario based on information about cyber attacks we have received from a healthcare organisation, as a reference sector that faces critical cyber and privacy threats.","output":"Automated Cyber and Privacy Risk Management Toolkit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 presented a multitude of challenges for physicians nationwide. Standard of care treatment was tailored to protect patients from virus exposure, while delivering safe and adequate care. This article reviews the steps taken to treat and protect breast cancer patients during the pandemic and reentry approaches to resume care. RECENT FINDINGS: Breast cancer experts rapidly convened to develop treatment guidelines during the pandemic. These recommendations encompass screening approach, prioritization of breast cancer patients, educational modifications, research and data considerations, and a re-entry treatment approach as the pandemic evolved. Without prior experience with a pandemic of this magnitude, these guidelines were based on expert knowledge and previously established data. SUMMARY: This emergency forced physicians to operate in a more efficient and effective manner to deliver value-based patient care, and future evaluation of these adjustments will determine if overall patient outcomes were compromised.","output":"Lessons Learned: Management of Breast Cancer Patients throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early risk stratification is crucial in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Myocardial injury is associated with worse outcome. This study aimed to evaluate cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients and to assess their association with 30-day mortality in comparison to other biomarkers, risk factors and clinical severity scores. Methods: Prospective, single-center, cohort study in patients with PCR-confirmed, critical COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high sensitive troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on admission to ICU: a hs-cTnT  14 pg/mL and a NT-proBNP  450 pg/mL were considered as elevated. Transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation was performed within the first 48 hours of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Predictive markers for mortality were assessed by ROC analysis and cut-off values by the Youden Index. Results: A total of 100 patients were included. The median age was 63.5 years, the population was predominantly male (66%). At the time of ICU admission, 47% of patients had elevated hs-cTnT and 39% had elevated NT-proBNP. Left ventricular ejection fraction was below 50% in 19.1%. Elevated cardiac biomarkers (hs-cTnT P-value < 0.001, NT-proBNP P-value = 0.001) and impaired left ventricular function (P-value 0.011) were significantly associated with mortality, while other biomarkers (D-dimers, ferritin, C-reactive protein) and clinical scores (SOFA) did not differ significantly between survivors and non-survivors. An optimal cut-off value to predict increased risk for 30-day all-cause mortality was 16.5 pg/mL for hs-cTnT (OR 8.5, 95% CI: 2.9, 25.0) and 415.5 pg/ml for NT-proBNP (OR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 14.7). Conclusion: Myocardial injury in COVID-19 is common. Early detection of elevated hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP are predictive for 30-day mortality in patients with critical COVID-19. These markers outperform other routinely used biomarkers, as well as clinical indices of disease severity in ICU. The additive value of routine transthoracic echocardiography is disputable and should only be considered if it is likely to impact therapeutic management.","output":"The Prognostic Value of Cardiac Biomarkers and Echocardiography in Critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the first months of 2020, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly and soon reached a pandemic level. With the increasing number of hospitalizations, medical and nursing personnel resources were soon inadequate. As a consequence, medical volunteers became a key human resource and young medical residents in any specialty were hired on a voluntary basis to contribute to take care of patients with COVID-19. This study reports on the lived experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry who volunteered in Italian hotspot COVID-19-designated hospitals during the epidemic outbreak. METHODS: A phenomenological, qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions was used to obtain in-depth narratives of the experience of residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in North Italy COVID-19-designated hospitals. All residents (n = 8) participated in the study. Interviews were conducted by an expert researcher trained in qualitative methods. Data analysis was performed by independent coders. RESULTS: Five core themes could be identified from the interviews: acting as mediators on two fronts, facing the shock of COVID-19 reality, capitalizing from specialty education, growing as persons and professionals, and humanizing medical care. CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique in providing an in-depth understanding of the experience of young residents in child neuropsychiatry volunteering in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. The findings suggest that this experience may be highly beneficial for both the residents and the hospital quality of care.

RESULTS: Almost all students (99.7%) reported using SM for learning, most (90.9%) of them daily. The most preferred type of SM learning was Facebook. Most students thought that using SM for learning is convenient and useful. They suggested there should be 1 Facebook account for each subject, that every classmate could access to obtain knowledge from lecturers and to interact between students and lecturers. The logistic regression model showed that the more time students practiced following the advice on posted information, the more likely they were to achieve a GPA at distinction level or above (OR = 4.2; OR = 5.4, and OR = 9.4, respectively with times of practicing).

Hot spots are defined as concentrated areas with sharp increases in COVID19 cases. Hot spots place stress on existing healthcare resources, resulting in demand for resources potentially exceeding current capacity. This research will describe a value based resource allocation approach that seeks to coordinate demand, as defined by uncertain epidemiological forecasts, with the value of adding additional resources such as hospital beds. Value is framed as a function of the expected usage of a marginal resource (bed, ventilator, etc). Subject to certain constraints, allocation decisions are operationalized using a nonlinear programming model, allocating new hospital beds over time and across a number of geographical locations.

The effect of additives, other than the filler, but typical in industrial applications, such as an antioxidant and a common compatibilizer, was investigated. The drawing ratio, the filler, and the compatibilizer or the antioxidant content were selected as design variables, whereas the tensile strength and the onset decomposition temperature were set as response variables. Fibers with very high tensile strength (up to 806 MPa) were obtained. The results revealed that the maximization of both the tensile strength and the thermal stability was not feasible for composites with talc due to multiple interactions among the used additives (antioxidant, compatibilizer, and filler). Additionally, it was found that the addition of talc in the studied particle size improved the mechanical strength of fibers only if low drawing ratios were used. On the other hand, the optimization targeting maximization of both tensile strength and thermal stability was feasible in the case of SWCNT composite fibers.

Some have expressed concern that these may affect the cardiopulmonary system by increasing the work of breathing (Wb), altering pulmonary gas exchange and increasing dyspnea, especially during physical activity. These concerns have been derived largely from studies evaluating devices intentionally designed to severely affect respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. We review the literature on the effects of various facemasks and respirators on the respiratory system during physical activity using data from several models: cloth face coverings and surgical masks, N95 respirators, industrial respirators and applied high resistive or high deadspace respiratory loads. Overall, the available data suggest that although dyspnea may be increased and alter perceived effort with activity, the effects on Wb, blood gases and other physiological parameters imposed by facemasks during physical activity are small, often too small to be detected, even during very heavy exercise. There is no current evidence to support sex-based or age-based differences in the physiological responses to exercise while wearing a facemask. While the available data suggest that negative effects of using cloth or surgical facemasks during physical activity in healthy individuals are negligible and unlikely to impact exercise tolerance significantly, for some individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease, any added resistance and/or minor changes in blood gases may evoke considerably more dyspnea and, thus, affect exercise capacity.","output":"Facemasks and the Cardiorespiratory Response to Physical Activity in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Considering the rising menace of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is essential to explore the methods and resources that might predict the case numbers expected and identify the locations of outbreaks.

METHODS: The Google search terms used for the analysis were coronavirus, COVID, COVID 19, corona, and virus. GTs for these terms in Google Web, News, and YouTube, and the data on COVID-19 case numbers were obtained. Spearman correlation and lag correlation were used to determine the correlation between COVID-19 cases and the Google search terms.

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained.

Besides the mapping of cases and deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen an explosion of attempts to track policy responses. They have come from actors sometimes initially unfamiliar with public and global health. In this paper, we analyse seven of the most successful tracker initiatives that have sought to map governments? reactions to COVID-19 and reflect on our own. When not led by international organisations, the trackers primarily rely on networks of volunteer country expert contributors (who need to be incentivised in the medium term). The vertical crowdsourcing approach means that, despite good intentions, contributors have a relatively limited agency in shaping the trackers. Maps and timelines comparing countries are the most popular visualisations;they suggest that (some) policy solutions can be found abroad and rely on policy taxonomies established by the trackers? core teams. We contend that such taxonomies, which compete with each other, constitute attempts to frame the complex issue of which policies matter in responding to COVID-19. All the projects are large and complex and often without a well-defined intended audience. We hypothesise that the popularity (in terms of backlinks) of the most successful tracker arises from the fact that it sums up COVID-19 policies in one easily visualisable indicator. We suggest that the trackers are a more helpful emergency policy tool when they provide contextual information, keep policy details or refer to them (rather than only reduce them to categories), and suggest ways to link different elements?including the relationship between health or societal outcomes and policies.","output":"Visualising policy responses during health emergencies.

In this study, TGF-1-/-Runx2-/- and TGF-1+/-Runx2+/- mice were successfully generated to clarify the relationship between TGF-1 and RUNX2 during amelogenesis. Lower mineralization was observed in TGF-1-/-Runx2-/- and TGF-1+/-Runx2+/- mice than single gene deficient mice. Micro-computed tomography (CT) revealed a lower ratio of enamel to dentin density in TGF-1-/-Runx2-/- mice. Although CT elucidated a relatively constant enamel thickness, variation was identified by scanning electron microscopy, which revealed that TGF-1-/-Runx2-/- mice were more vulnerable to acid etching with lower degree of enamel mineralization. Furthermore, the double gene knock-out mice exhibited more serious enamel dysplasia than the single gene deficient mice. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed abnormalities in ameloblast morphology and arrangement in TGF-1-/-Runx2-/- mice, which was accompanied by the absence of atypical basal lamina (BL) and the ectopic of enamel matrix. Odontogenesis-associated phosphoprotein (ODAPH) has been identified as a component of an atypical BL. The protein and mRNA expression of ODAPH were down-regulated. In summary, TGF-1 and RUNX2 might synergistically regulate enamel mineralization through the downstream target gene Odaph.

Existing literature lacks information on whether municipalities have implemented cybersecurity policies, if such policies are applied in practice and what they encompass. A CAWI method was used to collect the required data. The results indicate that while most municipalities have a document defining their security policy, they do not always apply it in practice. There is still little awareness regarding countering cyberattacks. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on such issues as: integrating cybersecurity policies into local government management, the rising threat of cyber-attacks, consultations with security auditors, and cybersecurity management training.

Recent viral outbreaks have manifested the need of robust vaccine production platforms able to adapt to new challenges while achieving mass production capacity. For the rapid production of VLPs, the method of transient gene expression (TGE) have proved highly efficient. Based on a previous characterization of the HEK293 cell line upon transient transfection using multiplexed quantitative proteomics, molecular production bottlenecks and metabolic pathways likely to be optimized were identified. In this work, these molecular components and metabolic pathways have been explored and modulated via transient metabolic engineering using approaches like design of experiments (DoE) to fully exploit and optimize VLP production, transfection and budding efficiency. Upon overexpression of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) accessory proteins like NEDD4L and CIT, VLP production increased 3.3 and 2.9-fold respectively. Overexpression of glycosphingolipid precursor enzyme UGCG improved transfection efficiency by 17% and knocking-down the Gag-binding protein CNP improved 2.5-fold VLP specific productivity. Combining CNP inhibition and UGCG overexpression further improved budding efficiency by 37.3%. Modulating VLP production and accessory pathways like intracellular budding, demonstrated the potential of metabolic engineering to optimize and intensify the development of robust production platforms for future vaccines.

However, health-related information from the web has the potential to trigger anxiety and stress. The understanding of contributing factors for distress during health-related information search processes and which factors could be targeted for prevention is still limited. METHODS: Parents living in Austria with a child between 0 and 6 years were randomly assigned to search the web for current somatic health issues related to self- or child-symptoms. The task was performed on a desktop computer with a timeframe of 15 minutes. The stress level was assessed immediately before and after the search task with the State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STAI). Recruitment was terminated early due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic outbreak (sample size prior to COVID-19, N = 53). RESULTS: Multiple linear regression was used to predict parents' stress change during the search task based on health anxiety, attitude towards online health information, eHealth literacy, couple satisfaction and parental burden. Health anxiety, attitude towards online health information and eHealth literacy did not significantly contribute to predict parents' stress change (STAI state anxiety change), however couple satisfaction ( = -.393, t = -2.46, p = .018) and parental burden ( = -.388, t = -2.30, p = .026) did. Higher parents' baseline level of stress immediately before the search task was only associated with higher levels of parental burden ( = .882, t = 4.00, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate the importance of the relational level, rather than the individual level, in understanding stress during online health information seeking among parents. Future research should incorporate relational variables like parental burden and couple satisfaction into theoretical models and test their influence on online health distress in larger samples. KEY MESSAGES: Family and relational variables should be considered in future research investigating distress during online health information seeking for oneself or by proxy. Fostering parents' couple satisfaction and reducing parental burden may can contribute to lower stress levels after symptom-related online searches.","output":"Risk factors for distress during online health information seeking behavior in parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The percentage of elderly population in India has been increasing in recent years and so have been lifestyle-related conditions such as cardiovascular diseases In order to live an active and healthy life, it is important for elderly to manage their routine health and fitness activities such as exercising, following nutrition and diet etc This need has become pressing after the COVID-19 lockdowns Though there are many technology artefacts designed to motivate and help elderly people live a healthy lifestyle, adoption of such artefacts remains low for this population In this paper, we present findings from interviews with 15 elderly people related to their needs and preferences about health and fitness, and their attitudes and knowledge about using technology to support these Our main finding was that though there is an increase in technology usage by the elderly, much of it is restricted to communication and content consumption and not towards managing health and fitness After the interview, we demonstrated selected applications and devices to the participants in order to understand their perceptions on existing technology in the market in managing their health and fitness Based on participants' perceptions towards technology and their needs related to routine health and fitness, we highlight some design opportunities including smart trackers, wearable bands, localized food and recipe app, language-based personalization and setting up \\"tech clinics\\"to help elderly to manage their health and fitness ? 2020 ACM","output":"Design opportunities for supporting elderly in India in managing their health and fitness post-covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures and its associated factors among pregnant women in Ghana.

Problems of variable CD vaccine safety and efficacy persist, but CD vaccines have greatly reduced the prevalence of disease and cases in vaccinated dogs are now rare. Canine hepatitis (ICH, CAV-1 infection) also has been controlled well by vaccines for more than 35 years and it is now rare; the sporadic cases seen in the 1990s have usually occurred in unvaccinated dogs. CAV-2 vaccines should, therefore, continue to be given since they have proved to be safe and effective, and prevent hepatitis as well as adenoviral tracheobronchitis. Failure to vaccinate would likely result in increase in cases of ICH, a serious disease, but never as significant as distemper and CPV infection. \\"Are we vaccinating too often?\\" The question is complex, but the dominant opinion is \\"yes\\" (Smith, 1995). The question cannot be responded to unequivocally, however, since manufacturers employ different strains that vary in their immunizing capacity and, probably, duration of immunity. This question was frequent with distemper in the 1960s. At that time, many veterinarians tested batches of the vaccine they used by providing pre- and postvaccinal sera to competent diagnostic laboratories. That practice appeared to benefit veterinarians and dogs, as well as the quality of vaccines. Unfortunately, many owners and some veterinarians seem to hold the view that infectious diseases such as parvovirus infection can be controlled by frequent vaccination alone. The common practice of dog breeders of vaccinating their animals several times each year is senseless. Revaccination for distemper and parvovirus infection is suggested at 1 year of age, but recommendations regarding the frequency of most vaccinations given after that time are unclear. Since most distemper and CPV-2 vaccines probably provide immunity that endures several years, vaccination at 3- to 5-year intervals, after the first year, seems a reasonable practice until more data on duration of immunity become available. \\"Are too many kinds of vaccines being promoted for dogs?\\" Distemper and parvovirus vaccines are essential; canine adenovirus vaccines are recommended since the few cases brought to our attention in recent years have been in unvaccinated dogs. Vaccination against respiratory infections is recommended for most dogs, especially those in kennels, or if they are to be boarded. Need has not been clearly established for coronavirus vaccines; Lyme disease vaccines (see below) are useful in preventing illness in areas where the disease exists, but are unnecessary elsewhere since dogs respond rapidly to appropriate antibiotics; current Leptospira bacterins are without benefit since they contain serovars that fail to protect in most areas (noted below). Lyme disease (LD) was not considered here, but newer recombinant (OspA) vaccines are now available that appear to be safe and effective for at least 1 year and they have not caused vaccine-induced postvaccinal lameness, which has been documented with certain whole-cell Lyme disease bacterins. Lyme disease vaccines should be restricted to dogs in, or entering, endemic areas where infested ticks reside. More than 85% of LD cases occur in the mid-Atlantic and Northeastern States, about 10% in six Midwestern states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), and a smaller percentage in restricted areas of northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Leptospirosis also was not discussed here, but vaccines are commonly reported as a cause of anaphylaxis and current vaccines do not contain the serovars prevalent in most regions. The vast majority of cases diagnosed at the New York State Diagnostic Lab at Cornell are grippotyphosa and pomona serovars and there have been no recent cases caused by canicola or icterohemorrhagiae serovars.

They are a major contributing factor of disease in industrialized countries, and are responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and a direct annual financial loss of $6-7 billion in North America alone. They are an increasingly challenging health issue due to multidrug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci among others, along with an increasing number of susceptible patients. Over the last three decades, the risk of HCAIs has increased in the radiology department (RD) in part because of an increased number of patients visiting the department and an increase in the utilization of imaging modalities. In this review, we will discuss how patients and staff can be exposed to HCAIs in the RD, including contaminated inanimate surfaces, radiology equipment, and associated medical devices. As the role of medical imaging has extended from primarily diagnosis to include more interventions, the implementation and development of standardized infection minimization protocols and infection control procedures are vital in the RD, particularly in interventional radiology. With globalisation and the rapid movement of people regionally, nationally, and globally, there is greater risk of exposure to contagious diseases such as Ebola, especially if infected patients are undiagnosed when they travel. For effective infection control, advanced training and education of HCWs in the RD is essential. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of HCAIs as related to activities of the RD. We will discuss the following major topics including the variety of HCAIs commonly encountered, the role of the RD in HCAIs, transmission of infections to patients and HCWs in the RD, standard infection prevention measures, and the management of susceptible/infected patients in the RD. We shall also examine the role of, and the preparedness of, HCWs, including RD technologists and interventional radiologists, who may be exposed to undiagnosed, yet infected patients. We shall conclude with a brief discussion of the role of further research related to HCAIs. Learning Objectives After the completion of this review article, the readers will ? Understand the exposure and role of radiology department in health careCassociated infections, ? Know the causes/modes/transmission of infections in radiology department, ?

This study aims to investigate the potential functional roles of miR-543 in DN and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-543 and TSPAN8 in kidney tissues of mice with DN. Western blot (WB) was used to measure the protein levels. CCK8 assay was employed to evaluate the proliferation of HK2 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the functional interaction between miR-543 and TSpan8. RESULTS The downregulation of miR-543 and upregulation of TSPAN8 were observed in kidney tissues of mice with DN. miR-543 mimic significantly decreased cell proliferation and autophagy in high-glucose (HG)-induced HK2 cells, and promoted cell fibrosis. We further identified a putative binding site between miR-543 and TSPAN8, which was validated by Dual luciferase reporter assay. The treatment of miR-543 mimic and miR-543 inhibitor could reduce or increase TSPAN8 protein level respectively. We further showed that the overexpression of TSPAN8 could attenuate HG-induced cell injury by reducing fibrosis and increase autophagy. The effects of miR-543 mimic in proliferation, fibrosis, and autophagy were rescued by TSPAN8 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicate that miR-543 mediates high-glucose induced DN via targeting TSPAN8.

METHODS: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 420 symptomatic children and young adults with lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated between March 15 and June 16, 2020 at Childrens National Hospital in Washington DC. We identified and compared cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=324) and hospitalized (N=96) patients, including non-critically ill (N=64) and critically ill hospitalized (N=32) patients. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records RESULTS: Of 420 SARS-CoV-2-infected symptomatic patients, 23% required hospitalization, of which 67% were non-critically ill and 33% were critically ill. All age groups were represented in the symptomatic cohort, with a median age of 8.6 years. Patients > 15 years of age represented 44% of critical care admissions. Males and females were equally represented in all cohorts. Underlying medical conditions were present in 36%, but more common in hospitalized (59 %) and critically ill (66 %) patients. The most frequent underlying diagnosis overall was asthma (16 %), but also included neurologic (6 %), diabetes (3 %), obesity (3 %), cardiac (3 %), hematologic (3 %) and oncologic (1 %) conditions. The majority (66 %) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presented with respiratory symptoms with or without fever. Other symptoms were also present, including diarrhea/vomiting (21 %), myalgia (11 %), chest pain (8 %) and loss of sense of smell or taste (7%). Hospitalized patients required varying levels of respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, BiPAP, RAM cannula and HFNC. Additional presentations included diabetic hyperglycemia, sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis, vascular complications, and multisystem inflammation. Treatment included remdesivir, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab and other therapies. CONCLUSION: Although children/young adults have been less affected than elderly adults, the impact of SARS-CoV2 on this population has been significant in Washington DC and informs other regions anticipating their surge.

The overall theme of these reports was that electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but the power grid is still reliablemostly due to reduced economic activity. In this paper, we analyze electricity data until the end of May 2020, examining both electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid. We limit this study to three states in the U.S. California, Florida and New York. The results indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction, and there are noticeable differences among regions analyzed. The variables that can indicate stress on the grid (e.g., daily peak and trough of the hourly demand, demand ramp rate, demand forecast error, and net electricity interchange) also conveyed mixed messages: some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is correcting for weather as it can be challenging to accurately define it for large geographic regions. We provide a weather-correction method, apply it to a small city-wide area in North Central Florida, and discuss the implications of the estimated changes in demand.

Given the wide community spread of the disease, it can be difficult for radiologists to differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the oncological setting. Objective: This study was aimed at developing an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that could automatically detect COVID-19-related abnormalities from chest CT images and could serve as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19. In addition, we assessed the performance and accuracy of the algorithm in differentiating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 lung parenchyma pathologies. Materials and Methods: A total of 1581 chest CT images of individuals affected with COVID-19, individuals affected with non-COVID-19 pathologies, and healthy individuals were included in this study. All the digital images of COVID-19-positive cases were obtained from web databases available in the public domain. About 60% of the data were used for training and validation of the algorithm, and the remaining 40% were used as a test set. A single-stage deep learning architecture based on the RetinaNet framework was used as the AI model for image classification. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using various publicly available datasets comprising patients with COVID-19, patients with pneumonia, other lung diseases (underlying malignancies), and healthy individuals without any abnormalities. The specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were measured to estimate the effectiveness of our method. Results: The semantic and non-semantic features of the algorithm were analyzed. For the COVID-19 classification network, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.97), 0.995 (95% CI: 0.984-1.0), 0.972 (95% CI: 0.952-0.988), and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.945-0.986), respectively.

The nurses of emergency and fever outpatient (EFO) act as gatekeepers to the health care system in the public health response to COVID-19 epidemic. This study examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 upon EFO nurses in Chinese hospitals. Methods In midmonth of February, 2020, convenience sampling was used to recruit EFO nurses from hospitals in Jiangsu Province. Data were obtained by self-administered online questionnaires, which consisted of a general questionnaire, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale-14 and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. A total of 481 questionnaires were returned and 453 valid questionnaires were recovered. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the influence of socio-psychological and working condition factors on anxiety, stress and stress coping tendency. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the associations among anxiety, stress and coping tendency. Results Among the participants, 281(62.03%) had no anxiety symptoms, 154(34.00%) had mild anxiety, 16(3.53%) had moderate anxiety, and 2(0.44%) had severe anxiety. There were 146(32.23%) participants with scores greater than 25 in the PSS, indicating excessive stress. We found that 229(50.55%) participants were more likely to respond positively to stress, while 224(49.45%) were more likely to respond negatively. The models we used included gender, fear of infecting family members, regretting being a nurse, having children, confidence in fighting outbreak, rest time, professional attitudes, having attended infection prevention training, and number of night shifts;and they were all predictors of the mental health of EFO nurses.

METHODS: Clinical data from 22 cases of lumbar TB with abscess receiving treatments from July 2015 to January 2021 were analyzed. Some patients (n = 11) underwent pure surgery (control group) and the others (n = 11) received CT-guided catheterization drainage. The operation and hospitalization time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), visual analog scale (VAS), ASIA damage grade, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of both groups were compared. RESULTS: The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay of the observation group were significantly less than those of the control group (P < 0.05). As the differences in preoperative ESR, CRP, and VAS scores between both groups did not reach significance (P > 0.05), after treatments, the observation group had a lower level of ESR and CRP (P < 0.05); the postoperative VAS scores of the two groups decreased (P > 0.05). Before treatment, the control group comprised 2 cases of ASIA grade A, 1 case of B, 6 cases of C, and 2 cases of D with 3 patients having dyskinesia. After surgery, the motor function of the patients was improved, and there were 3 cases of ASIA D and 8 cases of E. Meanwhile, the preoperative observation group consisted of 9 cases of ASIA D and 2 cases of E. Due to CT-guided catheterization, all patients achieved clinical healing (ASIA E) when the lesions were significantly alleviated, and symptoms such as low back pain and lower extremity pain disappeared.

Ozone concentrations are highest in summer, driven by fast photochemical production of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) that can overcome the radical titration caused by high emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from fuel combustion. Ozone has been very low during winter haze (particulate) pollution episodes. However, the abrupt decrease of NOx emissions following the COVID-19 lockdown in January 2020 reveals a switch to fast ozone production during winter haze episodes with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations of 60 to 70 parts per billion. We reproduce this switch with the GEOS-Chem model, where the fast production of ozone is driven by HOx radicals from photolysis of formaldehyde, overcoming radical titration from the decreased NOx emissions. Formaldehyde is produced by oxidation of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which have very high emissions in the North China Plain. This remarkable switch to an ozone-producing regime in January-February following the lockdown illustrates a more general tendency from 2013 to 2019 of increasing winter-spring ozone in the North China Plain and increasing association of high ozone with winter haze events, as pollution control efforts have targeted NOx emissions (30% decrease) while VOC emissions have remained constant.

We estimated the prevalence of reported SRH service access and failed access, and calculated age-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for sexually-experienced (1 sexual partner/lifetime;n=3,065) and sexually-active (1 sexual partner/past year;n=2,752) participants aged 18C44 years.Results20.8% (95%CI:19.3%-22.3%) of sexually-experienced participants reported accessing 1 SRH service in the 4-months from lockdown. 9.7% (8.6%-10.8%) reported being unable to access a service they needed, though many of these participants (76.4%) also reported successful access. 14.8% (13.1%-16.6%) of sexually-experienced women reported accessing contraception services since lockdown, and this was more likely for younger women (OR, 18C24 vs. 35C44 years: 2.96 (1.95 C 4.49)). Among sexually-active participants, 4.8% (4.0%-5.7%) reported accessing STI-related services (STI/HIV testing and follow-up care) and this was higher in those aged 18C24 years (10.1%). Participants reporting any new condomless partner(s) since lockdown were more likely to report accessing STI-related services (aOR, men: 23.77 (11.55C48.92), women: 10.53 (3.94C28.15)) and, amongst men, to report a failed attempt (aOR 13.32 (5.39C32.93)). Among those reporting STI testing (n=106), 33.4% (24.1%-44.2%) did so online, 31.5% (22.0%-42.9%) by phone, 43.9% (33.4%-55.0%) in-person, and 14.8% (8.3%-25.2%) via video consultation.ConclusionOur findings are consistent with SRH services in Britain adapting rapidly in response to COVID-19 and prioritising access for those in need. However, a significant proportion of participants reported difficulty accessing care, suggesting that services may need to adapt further to address and prevent a backlog of need among some high-risk groups.","output":"O04.4 Measuring impacts of COVID-19 on sexual and reproductive health service use in Britain: findings from a large, quasi-representative survey (Natsal-COVID)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 can be especially dangerous in vulnerable populations such as those with cancer undergoing treatment.

Because of the time constraints associated with the development of vaccines and effective drugs, drug repurposing and other alternative treatment methods have been used to treat patients that have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have acquired COVID-19. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanism of action of repurposed drugs or alternative treatment medicines used to attenuate COVID-19 disease. The research articles or grey literature, including theses, government reports, and official news online, were identified from 4 databases and 1 search engine. The full content of a total of 160 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria was analyzed and information about 6 drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir, favipiravir, and chloroquine) and 4 traditional Chinese medicines (Shuang Huang Lian Kou Fu Ye, TCM combination of Bu Huan Jin Zheng Qi San and Da Yuan Yin, Xue Bi Jing Injection and Qing Fei Pai Du Tang) were extracted. All of the drug treatment options depend on the ability of the drug to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by binding to enzyme active sites, viral chain termination, or triggering of the molecular pathway, whereas traditional Chinese medicine has a pivotal role in triggering the inflammation pathway, such as the neuraminidase blocker, to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Risk factors that increase the likelihood of hospitalization or poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients, such as advanced age, nursing home residence, debilitation, diabetes and cardiopulmonary or other underlying systemic diseases, also predispose to AMR infections. Worry for AMR emergence is heightened since first-wave COVID-19 epicentres were also AMR epicentres. Disruptive direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 globally on economic systems, governance and public health expenditure and infrastructure may fuel AMR spread.

METHODS: Data were obtained from multiple open databases and genetic alteration, gene expression, survival association, functional enrichment, stemness, mutation association, immunity association, and drug therapy association of RAD51were analyzed. A prognostic model of RAD51 for overall glioma was constructed as an example application of RAD51 as a biomarker. RESULTS: RAD51 was overexpressed in 28 types of cancers and was associated with worse overall survival in 11 cancer types. RAD51 correlated genes were enriched in cell cycle terms. RAD51 was associated with cancer stemness, tumor mutational burden, and multiple immunomodulators in different cancer types. RAD51 expression was different across immune subtypes in 11 cancer types. RAD51 was closely associated with cancer immune microenvironments in some cancer types. Proliferating T cells was the cell type that expressed highest RAD51 across most of the cancer samples analyzed. RAD51 expression had an AUC of over 0.5 in 12 of the 23 ICB subcohorts. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion of 9 cancer types were different between RAD51 high and low groups. RAD51 expression showed negative correlations with the sensitivity of most drugs. A prognostic nomogram was constructed with a high confidence.

However, most of the surgical masks on the market are disposable that cannot be self-sterilized for reuse. Thus, when confronting the global public health crisis, a severe shortage of mask resource is inevitable. In this paper, a novel low-cost electrothermal mask with excellent self-sterilization performance and portability is reported to overcome this shortage. First, a flexible, ventilated, and conductive cloth tape is patterned and adhered to the surface of a filter layer made of melt-blown nonwoven fabrics (MNF), which functions as interdigital electrodes. Then, a graphene layer with premier electric and thermal conductivity is coated onto the MNF. Operating under a low voltage of 3 V, the graphene-modified MNF (mod-MNF) can quickly generate large amounts of heat to achieve a high temperature above 80 C, which can kill the majority of known viruses attached to the filter layer and the mask surface. Finally, the optimized graphene-modified masks based on the mod-MNF filter retain a relatively high particulate matter (PM) removal efficiency and a low-pressure drop. Moreover, the electrothermal masks can maintain almost the same PM removal efficiency over 10 times of electrifying, suggesting its outstanding reusability.","output":"Reusable Self-Sterilization Masks Based on Electrothermal Graphene Filters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: An important prognostic factor in any form of infection seems to be glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with COVID-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated. On the basis of admission glycemia >7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization. The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Thirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic. In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively. The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65  0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69  1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group. At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (P < 0.001). Even though all patients were on standard treatment for COVID-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization. In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with hyperglycemia and patients with diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes and with normoglycemia. Cox regression analysis evidenced that patients with hyperglycemia treated with insulin infusion had a lower risk of severe disease than patients without insulin infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin infusion may be an effective method for achieving glycemic targets and improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Outcomes in Patients With Hyperglycemia Affected by COVID-19: Can We Do More on Glycemic Control?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In HIV-1-infected individuals, transmitted/founder (TF) virus contributes to establish new infection and expands during the acute phase of infection, while chronic control (CC) virus emerges during the chronic phase of infection. TF viruses are more resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-)-mediated antiviral effects than CC virus, however, its virological relevance in infected individuals remains unclear. Here we perform an experimental-mathematical investigation and reveal that IFN- strongly inhibits cell-to-cell infection by CC virus but only weakly affects that by TF virus. Surprisingly, IFN- enhances cell-free infection of HIV-1, particularly that of CC virus, in a virus-cell density-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that LY6E, an IFN-stimulated gene, can contribute to the density-dependent enhancement of cell-free HIV-1 infection. Altogether, our findings suggest that the major difference between TF and CC viruses can be explained by their resistance to IFN--mediated inhibition of cell-to-cell infection and their sensitivity to IFN--mediated enhancement of cell-free infection.","output":"Antithetic effect of interferon- on cell-free and cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stories and storytelling provide meaning and build connections between individuals Using various narrative frameworks developed in the medical and career development disciplines, the author makes the case that narrative approaches can be applied to higher education and student affairs contexts The use and misuse of technology can serve as a barrier when it disrupts the interactions and objectives between educator and student An overview of narrative competenciesa collection of skills that educators can use with studentsis provided in an attempt to more fully listen and honor students voices Students can learn to develop authoring and re-authoring skills to highlight competencies they developed during times of crisis and transition Two students stories of how they negotiated a harrowing study abroad experience during the beginning of Covid-19 are shared The author highlights several examples of narrative-based curriculum and encourages student affairs educators to integrate narrative models into existing and new training programs","output":"Stories to Craft: Applying Narrative Competencies to Student Affairs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the clinical, virological and safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)--1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in COVID-19 inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multi-centre open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), add-on trial to Solidarity (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens, pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, which were stopped prematurely. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants (lopinavir/ritonavir, n=145; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN--1a, n=145; hydroxychloroquine, n=145; control, n=148), among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR, 54-71) and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease.

METHODS: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of 7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. RESULTS: During the 2015C2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or re-enrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. CONCLUSION: RSV had an attack rate of 10C13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection.

Although official lockdowns were typically short-term and allowed people to leave their homes for exercise and essential activities, some individuals did not leave their home for prolonged periods due to a range of factors including clinical vulnerability. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of such home confinement across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and its associated predictors and mental health outcomes. MethodsData were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25,390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months from March 2020 to July 2021. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. ResultsOur analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment policy/advice (32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (43.1%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of home confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The class with a high level of confinement had the highest number of depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of the follow-up independent of potential confounders.

Physical distancing interventions and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented reductions in many of the constraints on substance use and in critical evolutionarily salient sources of alternative reward, such as social interaction, physical activity, leisure activities and hobbies, and academic and occupational pursuits. Thus, behavioral economics suggests that the pandemic and necessary public health response have created a \\"perfect storm\\" for exacerbation of individual-level and population-level substance use problems and also points to multilevel intervention strategies. We summarize this perspective and research by highlighting 3 critical behavioral processes that will influence drug and alcohol consumption. First, the sudden absence of many effective constraints on substance use (work, school, community, or service obligations) will reduce the actual and perceived cost of use. Second, physical distancing measures will reduce the availability, and increase the cost, of many rewarding substance-free activities and commodities. Third, increased uncertainty around current and future events increases discounting of delayed rewards. These effects will be especially pernicious among populations with existing health disparities. Next, we outline interventions suggested by behavioral economics to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on substance use that are aimed at increasing perceived costs of use; increasing access to substance-free activities, including treatment; and lengthening the timeframe for behavioral allocation and altering environmental contexts to promote healthy choices.

METHOD: A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in this open uncontrolled prospective cohort study. Rapid lateral flow tests, detecting a combination of IgM and IgM against SARS-CoV-2), two different types of CLIA (Diasorin, Roche), RT-PCR tests and serum neutralization tests (SNTs) were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4  7.7 (Min = 30, Max = 64) days. Positive participants were re-tested with CLIA/SNT at a third time point after 188.0  12.8 days. RESULTS: Only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.82%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among positively tested participants in either test, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding 6 weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%). Based on the neutralization test as the true condition, the rapid antibody test performed better on serum than whole blood as 84.6% instead of 65.4% could be detected correctly. Concerning both CLIA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity = 88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity = 81.5%).

This study not only helped managers to realize the hazards of occupational health risks, but also encouraged employees to actively participate in safety construction and pay attention to their own health. In addition, we also put forward some targeted intervention measures to reduce the negative impact of perceived occupational health risks on job satisfaction.

Rotavirus was most commonly found in calves of 1 week of age or less (up to 22.2% in one group) but was not found in any calves later than 6 months of age. More than 80% of rotavirus-positive samples from diarrhoeic calves exhibited a titre of 128 or more (geometric mean 3454.5), whereas non-diarrhoeal calves had titres less than or equal to 128 (geometric mean=291.9), suggesting that rotavirus infection in calves in Bangladesh was mostly associated with diarrhoea.","output":"Rotavirus infection in calves in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthrax is a recurrent zoonosis in the Ukraine with outbreaks occurring repeatedly in certain areas. For determining whether several Bacillus anthracis genotypes are circulating in this region, four strains from various sources isolated from different regions of the Ukraine were investigated. By combining long- and short-read next-generation sequencing techniques, highly accurate genomes were reconstructed, enabling detailed in silico genotyping. Thus, the strains could be assigned to the Tsiankovskii subgroup of the TransEurAsia clade, which is commonly found in this region. Their high genetic similarity suggests that the four strains are members of the endemic population whose progenitor was once introduced in the Ukraine and bordering regions. This study provides information on B. anthracis strains from a region where there is little knowledge of the local population, thereby adding to the picture of global B. anthracis genotype distribution.

Since primary RVFV strains must be handled in BSL-3+ or BSL-4 facilities, a RVFV cellCcell fusion assay will facilitate the investigation of RVFV glycoprotein function under BSL-2 conditions. As for other members of the Bunyaviridae family, RVFV glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi, where the virus buds, and are not efficiently delivered to the cell surface. However, overexpression of RVFV glycoproteins using an alphavirus replicon vector resulted in the expression of the glycoproteins on the surface of multiple cell types. Brief treatment of RVFV glycoprotein expressing cells with mildly acidic media (pH 6.2 and below) resulted in rapid and efficient syncytia formation, which we quantified by -galactosidase -complementation. Fusion was observed with several cell types, suggesting that the receptor(s) for RVFV is widely expressed or that this acid-dependent virus does not require a specific receptor to mediate cellCcell fusion. Fusion occurred over a broad temperature range, as expected for a virus with both mosquito and mammalian hosts. In contrast to cell fusion mediated by the VSV-G glycoprotein, RVFV glycoprotein-dependent cell fusion could be prevented by treating target cells with trypsin, indicating that one or more proteins (or protein-associated carbohydrate) on the host cell surface are needed to support membrane fusion. The cellCcell fusion assay reported here will make it possible to study the membrane fusion activity of RVFV glycoproteins in a high-throughput format and to screen small molecule inhibitors for the ability to block virus-specific membrane fusion.","output":"Development and characterization of a Rift Valley fever virus cellCcell fusion assay using alphavirus replicon vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to empirically assess the effect of government decisions on market growth in response to social distancing initiatives, government reactions, economic support provision, and containment and health responses, to name a few. A panel dataset of daily stock market returns is analysed in this study, changes in COVID-19 cases, and government responses to 17 countries in the Pacific and South Asia from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. Findings indicate that social distancing policies have a significant negative effect on stock returns but a substantial positive impact on market growth when new cases' growth rate declines after accounting for country characteristics and systematic risk due to foreign factors. A direct negative effect is seen almost immediately, and a subsequently indirect positive effect is noted. As expected, policies regarding social distancing have an immediate negative impact, attributed mainly to the expected negative effect on economic activity. Subsequently, we see an indirect positive effect on market return because social distancing measures reduced the growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

DESIGN A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted. Six databases were searched from inception through March 2021: APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, Medline and PubMed. Only those studies referring to barriers and facilitators reported by CR participants were considered. Pilot and case report studies, non-peer-reviewed literature and studies published in a language other than English, Portuguese or Spanish were excluded. RESULTS Data were extracted and analysed on the basis of individual-, provider- and system/environmental-level factors. Of 2083 initial citations, sixteen studies were included, with nine being qualitative and seven observational in design. From these, ten multi-level barriers and seven multi-level facilitators were identified. Dietary recommendations included developing healthy eating habits, transitioning to vegetarian-rich diets and increasing fish oil and n-3 intake. Only one study reported on all of the nutrition education programme factors recommended by the Workgroup for Intervention Development and Evaluation Research. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to summarise specific barriers and facilitators to recommendation adherence among CR participants.

Next, by analyzing repeated cross-sectional weekly surveys of Asian Americans from July 2019 to May 2020 (n=12,907), we find that the group has leaned more towards the Democratic Party since Trump first made inflammatory remarks towards Asian Americans.

The meaning of \\"fever\\" varies depending on the cutoff temperature used, the type of thermometer, the time of the day, the site of measurements, and the person's gender and race. The absence of a universally accepted definition for fever has been especially problematic during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This investigation determined the extent to which fever is defined in COVID-19 publications, with special attention to those associated with pregnancy. RESULTS: Of 53 publications identified in which \\"fever\\" is reported as a manifestation of COVID-19 illness, none described the method used to measure patient's temperatures. Only 10 (19%) publications specified the minimum temperature used to define a fever with values that varied from a 37.3 C (99.1 F) to 38.1 C (100.6 F). CONCLUSIONS: There is a disturbing lack of precision in defining fever in COVID-19 publications. Given the many factors influencing temperature measurements in humans, there can never be a single, universally accepted temperature cut-off defining a fever. This clinical reality should not prevent precision in reporting fever. To achieve the precision and improve scientific and clinical communication, when fever is reported in clinical investigations, at a minimum the cut-off temperature used in determining the presence of fever, the anatomical site at which temperatures are taken, and the instrument used to measure temperatures should each be described.

We show the resilience of behavioral patterns with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively, while circadian rhythms tended to synchronize. In particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tended to restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is reduced by 1 h.

In the past there have been important works in physician recommendation. Our proposed work aims to be more inclusive and provide an automated hospital recommendation system to patients based on neural networks driven classification. We suggest a model that considers several unique parameters, including geographical location. To optimize its usefulness, we design a system that recommends hospitals for general consultation, specialty hospitals, and in view of the pandemic, hospitals recommended for treatment of COVID-19. In this work, we adopt Neural Networks and undertake a comparative analysis between several different available supervised algorithms to identify one best suited neural architecture that can work best in the applied fields. Based on our results from the analysis, we train the selected neural network with context relevant data. In the image of the recommendation system, we develop a website that uses the trained neural network on its backend and displays the recommendation results in a manner interpretable by the end user. We highlight the process of choosing the right neural model for the backend of the website. To facilitate the working of the website in real-time, we use real time databases hosted on Google Firebase and edge devices on hospital ends. Additionally, we suggest two hospital side data updation tools. These tools would ensure that hospitals can update the parameters which change quickly in the real world to their latest values so as to maintain the precision of the system.

These studies showed acceptable reliability for portions of the low back virtual exam. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted in 2 of the studies and showed general satisfaction (>80% would recommend). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the virtual spine examination may be comparable to the in-person physical examination for low back pain, though there is a significant void in the literature regarding the reliability of the physical examination as it pertains to specific surgical pathology of the spine.

SUMMARY This article summarizes the current research on ARDS biomarkers and provides insights into how they should be integrated as prognostic and predictive enrichment tools in future clinical trials.","output":"Biomarkers in acute respiratory distress syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern computer vision techniques applied to radiographic studies are presented as an alternative to assist the specialist in screening and diagnosing the respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), assisting in clinically severe cases, such as acute pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, organ failure, and death. This work proposes a screening method based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) based on deep learning techniques for the classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) exams. The proposed system called Computer-Aided Remote medical diagnostics System (CARMEDSys) applied to the diagnosis of COVID-19 consists of three main stages: 1) segmentation of the lung region in X-ray images, 2) deep extraction of attributes from the filtered pulmonary area and 3) Prediction patient status with machine learning assistance. The performance of CARMEDSys was evaluated considering twelve different deep neural networks, via the transfer of learning. Besides, the performance of this approach is evaluated against recent studies for the classification of healthy patients, with pneumonia, or with COVID-19. The evaluation methodology considered two different sets of radiographic images, reaching Sensitivity (99.97%), F1-Score (99.43%), and Accuracy (98.89%) promising to distinguish patients with pneumonia and COVID-19 combining DenseNet201 as attribute extractor with Support Vector Machine with radial basis function, exceeding up to 12.31 % sensitivity for prediction of COVID-19 recent related works. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Novel Web Platform for COVID-19 diagnosis using X-Ray exams and Deep Learning Techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past 20 years, dance has emerged as a safe, effective, and evidence-based community intervention that helps thousands of people living with Parkinson's disease around the globe maintain well-being and improve quality of life. From its initial emergence to the present, COVID-19 has posed fundamental challenges to people living with Parkinson's, forcing them to balance the need and desire to stay active and socially connected with the requirement to adhere to strict shelter-at-home orders. As cities and towns worldwide began shutting down in early 2020, people living with Parkinson's found themselves unable to access live dance activities that had provided consistent, reliable physical support; joyful cognitive stimulation; emotional connection; and social engagement. Government sanctioned closures and stay-at-home orders increased the potential for apathy, isolation, anxiety, and stress-factors that are already heightened in people with Parkinson's. COVID-19 also exacerbated disparities based on race, language, socioeconomic background, and age, inequities already present in the Parkinson's community and in Parkinson's-focused dance programming. In this article, the authors provide a description and analysis of ways one dance for Parkinson's program addressed multiples challenges through three key initiatives: online group classes in English and Spanish, telephone-based resources for people without internet access, and robust online training opportunities for teaching artists. The authors outline ways in which the pandemic has increased the inclusive nature of dance for Parkinson's programming and suggest that changes implemented during the pandemic will permanently alter program delivery for the better when it is safe to restore group classes in community settings.","output":"Dance as Lifeline: Transforming Means for Engagement and Connection in Times of Social Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Ausbildung ist geregelt durch die Weiterbildungskriterien der Gesellschaft fr P?diatrische Gastroenterologie und Ern?hrung (GPGE), die in Analogie zu denen des europ?ischen und nordamerikanischen Syllabus entwickelt und immer wieder aktualisiert wurden.

Since patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection present coagulation and immune system dysregulation, ischemic or haemorragic stroke is not uncommon, irrespective of respiratory distress. However, the occurrence of focal neurological deficits together with other symptoms like headache, cortical blindness, seizure and altered mental status should prompt the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Antithrombotic treatment, the alteration of endothelial function, and coagulopathy due to COVID-19 and PRES leading to the breakdown of bloodCbrain barrier may then contribute to the occurrence of a brain haemorrhage. METHODS: We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed bilateral occipital lobe haemorrhages suggestive of haemorrhagic PRES. We then reviewed the available literature about haemorrhagic evolution of PRES in COVID-19. RESULTS: We describe the clinical and radiological features of five COVID-19 patients who developed haemorrhagic PRES. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction resulting from the massive release of cytokines during the host immune response may be key factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related PRES. Antithrombotic therapy and the leakage of the bloodCbrain barrier can subsequently increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the lesioned brain tissue. A prompt diagnosis of PRES is mandatory, since the timely interruption/reversal of antithrombotic therapy may be a key determinant for a good prognosis.","output":"Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and brain haemorrhage as COVID-19 complication: a review of the available literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics like the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 can cause a significant strain on the healthcare system Healthcare organizations must be ready with their contingency plans for managing many patients with contagious infectious disease Ideally, every large hospital should have a facility that can function as a high-level isolation unit An isolation unit ensures that the healthcare staff and the hospital are equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks Unfortunately, such facilities do not exist in several hospitals, especially in resource-limited settings In such a scenario, healthcare setups need to convert their existing general structure into an infectious disease facility Herein, we describe our experience in transforming a general hospital into a functional infectious disease isolation unit","output":"Transforming a General Hospital to an Infectious Disease Hospital for COVID-19 Over 2 Weeks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 challenges world governments.

Higher BMI is also associated with higher incidences of treatment-related adverse events. This study assesses whether body mass index is associated with survival outcomes and adverse events in metastatic melanoma patients with systemic therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentric retrospective study, conducted from March 1, 2013 to April 29, 2019, enrolled adults with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma from the French multicentric prospective cohort-MelBase (NCT02828202). Patients with first-line chemotherapy and targeted and immune therapy were included. Underweight people and those with metastatic mucosal or ocular melanoma were excluded. Body mass index was categorized using the World Health Organization criteria. Co-primary outcomes included the association between body mass index and progression-free survival and overall survival, stratified by treatment type, sex and age. Secondary endpoints were the association of body mass index with overall response and treatment-related adverse events. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Totally, 1,214 patients were analyzed. Their median age was 66.0 years (range, 53-75). Male predominance was observed (n = 738 [61%]). Most patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (63%), followed by targeted therapy (32%), and had stage M1c disease (60.5%). Obese patients represented 22% of the cohort. The median follow-up duration was 13.5 months (range, 6.0-27.5). In the pooled analysis, no positive or negative association between body mass index and progression-free survival (p = 0.88)/overall survival (p = 0.25) was observed, regardless of treatment type, sex, and age. These results were nonsignificant in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The objective response rate, according to body mass index category, did not differ significantly regardless of age. Treatment-related adverse events were not associated with body mass index. CONCLUSION: The observed lack of an association between body mass index and survival demonstrates that body mass index is not a valuable marker of systemic treatment-related outcomes in metastatic melanoma. Future approaches might focus on the whole-body distribution.","output":"Relevance of body mass index as a predictor of systemic therapy outcomes in metastatic melanoma: analysis of the MelBase French cohort data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, people residing in continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) found themselves under strict instructions to self-isolate, imposed by the CCRC managements before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown.

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.

However, limited studies have investigated the effect of internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) on PMS. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ICBT can reduce symptom severity of women with PMS and improve their quality of life during the perimenstrual and late follicular phases of menstrual cycle. METHODS: The study included 92 university students aged 18C35 years who had moderate to severe PMS. The participants were allocated into two groups of 46 using block randomization. The intervention group underwent ICBT for two menstrual cycles, while the control group received no intervention. Before and after the intervention, all participants filled the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for two menstrual cycles and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction QuestionnaireShort Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) on days 1C2 and 11C13 of the menstrual cycle. Data were analyzed using univariate general linear models. RESULTS: Four students in the intervention group were lost to follow-up. Following the intervention, the mean score of total PMS symptoms was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (10.4 vs. 20.2, adjusted difference: ? 9.9 [95% CI ? 13.3 to ? 6.6]), and the score of perimenstrual quality of life was significantly higher (64.2 vs. 50.3, 14.1 [8.5 to 19.8]). However, there was no significant intergroup difference in the late follicular quality of life (68.3 vs. 67.3, 1.9 [? 4.4 to 8.1]).

METHODS: SGMSM, aged 18+, who reported sex with a man and methamphetamine use in the past 6 months were recruited to complete an online survey using online advertisements. Ordinal regression models examined predictors of greater perceived difficulty of getting help. Explanatory variables included participant characteristics (i.e., age, HIV status, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, region, income) and variables assessing patterns of methamphetamine use (i.e., frequency, % time methamphetamine is used alone and during sex; perceived need for help) and patterns of healthcare access (i.e., regular provider, past substance use service utilization). RESULTS: Of 376 participants, most were gay-identified (76.6%), white (72.3%), cisgender (93.6%), and had annual incomes of less than $60,000 CAD (68.9%). Greater perceived difficulty of getting help was associated with having lower income, sometimes using methamphetamine prior to or during sex, and greater perceived need for help.

METHODS We used responses (N = 1052) from a Web- and mail-based survey of a stratified random sample of HHAs included in CMS Home Health Compare in October 2019. We estimated national adoption rates for 27 possible QI activities related to organizational culture, health information technology, care process redesign, provider incentives, provider training, changes to staffing responsibilities, performance monitoring, and measure-specific QI initiatives and technical assistance. We used multivariate linear regression to examine the associations between HHA characteristics and QI adoption, and between QI adoption and CMS Home Health Quality of Patient Care Star Rating. RESULTS HHAs reported implementing an average of 16 QI activities (interquartile range 11-19 activities). Larger HHA size was associated with adopting 1.6 additional QI activities (p < 0.001). HHAs with higher proportions of disabled, black, or Hispanic patients adopted QI activities at similar or higher rates as other HHAs. Of the 27 QI activities, 23 were considered helpful by more than 80% of adopting HHAs. Compared with adopting 44% of QI activities (10th percentile among HHAs), adopting 89% of QI activities (90th percentile) was associated with a 0.4-star higher Star Rating (95% confidence interval 0.2-0.6). CONCLUSIONS HHAs report implementing a significant number of QI activities in response to CMS measurement programs; implementation of a greater number of activities is associated with better performance on publicly reported measures.

Here, we utilized dynamic structural equation modeling to explore patterns of body temperature change following an experimental respiratory virus challenge in an aggregated, archival dataset of human participants (N = 1,412). We also examined whether temperature dynamics during infection were related to symptom severity, as well as individual differences in biomarkers of inflammation and stress. We found that individuals meeting the criteria for infection exhibited higher but less stable body temperatures over time compared to those not meeting criteria of infection. While temperature parameters did not reliably predict symptom severity, higher levels of nasal proinflammatory cytokines were associated with lower, more consistent temperatures during the study period. Further, levels of salivary cortisol and urinary catecholamines measured at the beginning of the study appeared to have disparate effects on temperature change. In sum, this research highlights the utility of dynamic time series modeling as a framework for studying body temperature change and lends novel insights into how stress may interact with infection to influence patterns of thermoregulation.","output":"Dynamics of temperature change during experimental respiratory virus challenge: Relationships with symptoms, stress hormones, and inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research quantifies the various South African lockdown regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in terms of the basic reproduction number, $r_0$. It further calculates the levels of immunity required in order for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number ($r_0 = 1.93$) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-4 lockdown was found to be $1.69$. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally \`smarter' than the \`harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be $3.09$, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","output":"Quantification of the South African Lockdown Regimes, for the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, and the Levels of Immunity They Require to Work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to compare clinical characteristics and severity between adults with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-p) and influenza-related pneumonia (Flu-p).

Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. We analyze the performance of a screening strategy proposed in Tuscany (Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. Methods. We simulate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity=0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. Results. Assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11167.6 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Costs and false negatives increase with the prevalence. Conclusions. The analyzed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low.

The Post-Stroke Checklist facilitates the identification of health problems. The study aimed to use the Post-Stroke Checklist to identify the extent of health problems, and how they were addressed, in nursing home residents that experienced strokes in Sweden. We also investigated the feasibility of the Checklist in a nursing home context. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional explorative study. Twenty nursing homes in two regions of Sweden participated. We included residents that had experienced a stroke within approximately 3 years and the responsible staff members were approached. Questionnaires were completed during face-to-face meetings with staff members (n = 45) knowledgeable about the residents. Data collection included the Post-Stroke Checklist, Barthel Index, modified Rankin Scale, resident and staff characteristics, and a satisfaction-questionnaire completed by staff. RESULTS: At the included nursing homes 1061 residents, 22% (n = 239) had a history of stroke, and 6% (n = 65) had experienced strokes during the last 3.5 years. Forty-nine residents were included (41% men, median age, 86 years, range 59C97). Among the health problems identified with the Checklist, activities of daily living (82%) were most common, and spasticity (41%) and pain (29%) were least common. Residents had extensive care needs, with a median of six health problems per resident. The total number of health problems addressed by previous actions i.e., referrals, as suggested in the Checklist, was 124, when recalled by staff. The median Barthel index score was 35. Lack of follow-up after stroke (e.g., by using a checklist) was reported in 17/20 nursing homes. The staff were satisfied with the Post-Stroke Checklist. CONCLUSIONS: We found that more than 1/5 of residents had experienced a stroke; thus, the Post-Stroke Checklist was a useful tool in nursing homes. Half of the residents had more than six health problems, identified with the Post-Stroke Checklist. Extensive needs, combined with a lack of follow-up, indicated a risk of insufficient care. These findings suggested that nursing home routines could be improved with the Post-Stroke Checklist.

Literature data suggest that NRP-1 facilitates entry of the virus into the central nervous system through the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Moreover, published findings show that interfering with VEGF-A/NRP-1 using NRP-1 inhibitors may produce an analgesic effect. The review describes an association between NRP-1, SARS-CoV-2 and, inter alia, pathological changes in the retina. Based on the published findings, we suggest that NRP-1 is a very important mediator implicated in, inter alia, neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

On presentation, he was tachycardic to 121 beats per minute, tachypneic to 26 breaths per minute and saturating at 94% with 6L O2 NC. Labs showed a leukocytosis of 30.8 thousand/uL, lactic acidosis of 2.7. Respiratory multiplex and Covid-19 were negative. Chest radiograph revealed small left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation. Computed tomography scan of chest showed complete left lower lobe collapse due to BLVRS with well positioned endobronchial valves and moderate left pleural effusion. Ultrasound revealed evidence of septations consistent with complicated parapneumonic effusion. He underwent a pigtail chest tube placement. Fluid studies showed glucose level less than 5, LDH level of 1550. Patient was started on Unasyn and Azithromycin. Patient received tissue plasminogen activator and deoxyribonuclease therapy (TPA-DNase) per MIST II protocol. On Day 4, pleural fluid culture showed Streptococcus intermedius. He was monitored with serial Chest X-rays and bedside ultrasound which showed significant improvement. He underwent chest tube removal on 8th day of hospitalization. He was discharged with a total of 4-week course of Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. Dentist evaluation was emphasized. Patient is doing well on the follow up visit within a week after hospital discharge.

Our patient developed complicated parapneumonic effusion after left lower lobe BLVRS, that was successfully managed with chest tube placement, TPA-DNase per MIST II protocol and antibiotic therapy. In progressively worsening cases, uncertainty revolves around the possible need for removal of Zephyr valve and their candidacy for VATS decortication.

To overcome this, we use Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT), which enables the production of glycoconjugates in bacterial cells at considerably reduced costs, to generate a candidate glycan-based live vaccine intended to simultaneously protect against Campylobacter jejuni, avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and Clostridium perfringens. Campylobacter is the most common cause of food poisoning, whereas colibacillosis and necrotic enteritis are widespread and devastating infectious diseases in poultry. RESULTS: We demonstrate the functional transfer of C. jejuni protein glycosylation (pgl) locus into the genome of APEC 7122 serotype O78:H9. The integration caused mild attenuation of the 7122 strain following oral inoculation of chickens without impairing its ability to colonise the respiratory tract. We exploit the 7122 pgl integrant as bacterial vectors delivering a glycoprotein decorated with the C. jejuni heptasaccharide glycan antigen. To this end we engineered 7122 pgl to express glycosylated NetB toxoid from C. perfringens and tested its ability to reduce caecal colonisation of chickens by C. jejuni and protect against intra-air sac challenge with the homologous APEC strain. CONCLUSIONS: We generated a candidate glycan-based multivalent live vaccine with the potential to induce protection against key avian and zoonotic pathogens (C. jejuni, APEC, C. perfringens). The live vaccine failed to significantly reduce Campylobacter colonisation under the conditions tested but was protective against homologous APEC challenge. Nevertheless, we present a strategy towards the production of low-cost live-attenuated multivalent vaccine factories with the ability to express glycoconjugates in poultry.

Few of these companies have been able to take candidate drugs to market due to development costs not being met by funding opportunities, but those companies that have been able to challenge traditional big pharma in the marketplace. Most SMEs have instead supplied traditional pharma with pipeline candidate drugs, either by licensing them or by the large companies actually acquiring the whole of the SME which owns the intellectual property. Many other companies engage in providing traditional big pharma or other SMEs with technologies and services. Hundreds of such companies have arisen, many clustered around centres of academic excellence on the coasts of the USA, or in certain regions in Europe and Asia C such clustering of scientific prowess has changed the location of where even big pharma tends to perform its research. By 2006, a large proportion (but generally less than 50%) of new drugs could be track to an origin in an SME, trends indicate that the proportion will rise even though the common prediction that large pharma will abandon internal research in favour of in-licensing from SMEs remains far from reality.","output":"The Role of Small- or Medium-Sized Enterprises in Drug Discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During the initial COVID-19 pandemic, young United Kingdom (UK) kidney patients underwent lockdown and those with increased vulnerabilities socially isolated or 'shielded' at home. The experiences, information needs, decision- making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known. Objectives To understand the concerns and decision-making in CYA during the first lockdown, and perform subgroup analysis on shielded vs non-shielded patients Methods UK wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 among CYA aged 12-30, or parents of children aged <18 years with any degree of chronic kidney disease. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted. Results 118 CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs 40%), that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed: strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contract COVID-19, lost educational opportunities, socialisation, and career development, and frustration at public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14-21% CYA and 20 - 31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group. Conclusions This is the first study specifically surveying CYA with kidney conditions and their parents' experience of the COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown.

Although the growth of international trade flows relative to that of GDP has slowed down since the Great Recession, this paper finds little systematic evidence indicating that the world economy has already entered an era of de-globalisation. Instead, the observed slowdown in globalisation is a natural sequel to the unsustainable increase in globalisation experienced in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. I offer a description of the mechanisms leading to that earlier expansionary phase, together with a discussion of why these forces might have run out of steam, and of the extent to which they may be reversible. I conclude that the main challenge for the future of globalisation is institutional and political in nature rather than technological, although new technologies might aggravate the trends in inequality that have created the current political backlash against globalisation. Zooming in on the COVID-19 global pandemic, I similarly conclude that the current health crisis may further darken the future of globalisation if it aggravates policy tensions across countries.","output":"De-Globalisation?

Materials and MethodsWe extracted RT-PCR results, clinical history, and CXRs of all patients from a single institution between March and June 2020. 984 RT-PCR positive and 1043 RT-PCR negative radiographs were reviewed by 10 emergency radiologists from 4 academic centers. 100 cases were read by all radiologists and 1927 cases by 2 radiologists. Each radiologist chose the single best label per case: Normal, COVID-19, Other - Infectious, Other - Noninfectious, Non-diagnostic, and Endotracheal Tube. Cases labeled with endotracheal tube or non-diagnostic were excluded. Remaining cases were analyzed for label distribution, clinical history, and inter-reader agreement. Results1727 radiographs (732 RT-PCR positive, 995 RT-PCR negative) were included from 1,594 patients (51.2% male, 48.8% female, age 59 {+/-} 19 years). For 89 cases read by all readers, there was poor agreement for RT-PCR positive (Fleiss Score 0.36) and negative (Fleiss Score 0.46) exams.

Continuous infusion (CI) vancomycin may offer an advantage in CRRT. Limited studies exist comparing intermittent infusion (II) and CI vancomycin. The purpose of this study was to determine if CI vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT results in more frequent therapeutic concentrations compared to II vancomycin. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of critically ill adult patients receiving CI or II vancomycin while on CRRT between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2021. The primary outcome was frequency of therapeutic vancomycin concentration (15-25 mcg/mL) at 24  6 hours. Secondary outcomes included percentage of patients therapeutic at first concentration, percentage of patients with subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients were screened and 59 patients met inclusion criteria. Seventeen patients received CI vancomycin and 42 patients received II vancomycin. Baseline characteristics were similar with the exception of more COVID-19 patients, more frequent vasopressor therapy, a higher mean SOFA score, and higher BUN at CRRT initiation in the CI group. The total median loading dose was 1000 mg (IQR 1000-1750 mg) in the CI group and 2000 mg (IQR 1500-2000 mg) in the II group (p=0.003). The daily maintenance dose was 1250 mg (IQR 1250-1500 mg) in CI group and 1000 mg (IQR 1000-1000 mg) in the II group (p< 0.0001). Therapeutic concentration at 24  6 hours was achieved in 52.9% of CI patients compared to 47.6% of II patients (p=0.78). Subtherapeutic concentrations occurred less frequently in the CI group (11.8% vs 42.9%, p=0.03) whereas supratherapeutic concentrations occurred more frequently in the CI group (35.3% vs 2.4%, p=0.0016). ICU and hospital mortality were higher in the CI group (88.2% vs 52.4%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: CI vancomycin was associated with less subtherapeutic concentrations as compared to II vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT.

The objective of this study was to analyze phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in city of Ribeir?o Preto at the beginning of the pandemic and during the actual second wave. Twenty-nine nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive samples were sequenced by nanopore technology (18 obtained at the initial period of the pandemic and 11 during the second wave) and analyzed them phylogenetically. The performed analysis demonstrated that the majority of the strains obtained in the initial period of the pandemic in Ribeir?o Preto belonged mainly to the B1.1.33 lineage (61.1%), but B.1.1 (27.8%) and B.1.1.28 (11.1%) lineages were also identified. In contrast, the second wave strains were composed exclusively by the Brazilian variant of concern (VOC) P.1 (91%) and P.2 (9%) lineages. The obtained phylogenetic results were suggestive of successive SARS-CoV-2 lineage substitution in this Brazilian region by the P.1 VOC.

Their distinctive pathologies are based on specific interactions with cellular factors. In order to develop new antiviral treatments, it is of central importance to understand how viruses interact with their host and how infected cells react to the virus on a molecular level. Invading viruses are commonly sensed by components of the innate immune system, which is composed of a highly effective yet complex network of proteins that, in most cases, mediate efficient virus inhibition. Central to this process is the activity of interferons and other cytokines that coordinate the antiviral response. So far, numerous methods have been used to identify how viruses interact with cellular processes and revealed that the innate immune response is highly complex and involves interferon-stimulated genes and their binding partners as functional factors. Novel approaches and careful experimental design, combined with large-scale, high-throughput methods and cutting-edge analysis pipelines, have to be utilized to delineate the antiviral innate immune landscape at a global level.

However, control of acute infection is incomplete resulting in persistence of viral RNA in the central nervous system (CNS) associated with ongoing primary demyelination. A high prevalence of virus specific CD8 and CD4 T cells within the CNS correlates with ex vivo cytolytic activity and IFN- secretion, which are both required for virus reduction during the acute infection. Although most infected cell types are susceptible to perforin mediated clearance, IFN- is required for controlling infection of oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, by enhancing class I expression and inducing class II expression within resident CNS cells IFN- optimizes T cell receptor dependent functions. In addition to its direct anti viral activity, these multifactorial effects make IFN- more essential than perforin for viral control. CD4 T cells enhance CD8 T cell expansion, survival and effectiveness. Although both CD8 and CD4 T cells are retained within the CNS during persistence, they cannot control viral recrudescence in the absence of humoral immunity. Demyelination can be mediated by either CD8 or CD4 T cells; however, although a variety of effector molecules have been excluded, a dominant common denominator remains elusive.

Four main research topics were reviewed: SARS-CoV-2 infection: immunology and respiratory pathology; interrelationship of severe asthma endotypes and COVID-19 disease mechanisms; severe asthma epidemiology and COVID-19; and biologics for severe asthma in the context of COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 disease mechanisms start with upper respiratory cell infection, and afterwards several immunological facets are activated, contributing to disease severity, namely cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Although infrequent in the COVID-19 course some patients develop a cytokine storm that causes organ damage and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure. Regarding severe asthma endotypes, type2-high might have a protective role both in infection risk and disease course. There is conflicting data regarding the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 among severe asthma patients, with some studies reporting increased risk of infection and disease course, whereas others the other way round.

Such sampling may not always be feasible. A logistically easy approach is to collect a sample to test for infection at a regularly scheduled visit.

Patients underwent rescue therapeutic plasma exchange using the Spectra Optia(TM) Apheresis System (Terumo BCT Inc., USA), which operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2019 guidelines. A dose of 1.5 plasma volume was used for the first dose and then 1 plasma volume daily for a total of five doses. Plasma was replaced with Octaplas LG(?) (Octapharma AG, USA), which is an artificial fresh frozen plasma product that has undergone viral inactivation by prion reduction technology. We administered ARDS-net/prone positioning ventilation, empiric antiviral treatment, therapeutic anticoagulation, and intensive care unit supportive care. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia; elevated levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin; as well as low levels of ADAMTS-13 activity and antibody. Serology tests depicted positive IgM and IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin and anti-2-glycoprotein I antibodies). No side effects of therapeutic plasma exchange were recorded. After the completion of therapeutic plasma exchange, patients improved clinically and gradually recovered neurologically (after 27C32 days). To conclude, in life-threatening COVID-19, especially when immune dysregulation features such as antiphospholipid antibodies exist, therapeutic plasma exchange could be an effective rescue therapy.","output":"Life-threatening COVID-19 presenting as stroke with antiphospholipid antibodies and low ADAMTS-13 activity, and the role of therapeutic plasma exchange: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the time athletics facilities and activities reopen on your campus, your institution has no doubt taken steps to reduce the risk of COVID\\\\19 transmission.

An abnormal electrocardiogram is associated with poor outcome, and QT prolongation during the illness has been linked to pharmacological effects. This study sought to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 illness on the corrected QT interval (QTc). METHOD: For 293 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital via the emergency department for COVID-19 between 01/03/20 -18/05/20, demographic data, laboratory findings, admission electrocardiograph and clinical observations were compared in those who survived and those who died within 6 weeks. Hospital records were reviewed for prior electrocardiograms for comparison with those recorded on presentation with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients who died were older than survivors (82 vs 69.8 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have cancer (22.3% vs 13.1%, p = 0.034), dementia (25.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.034) and ischemic heart disease (27.8% vs 10.7%, p < 0.001). Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (244.6 mg/L vs 146.5 mg/L, p < 0.01), troponin (1982.4 ng/L vs 413.4 ng/L, p = 0.017), with a significantly longer QTc interval (461.1 ms vs 449.3 ms, p = 0.007). Pre-COVID electrocardiograms were located for 172 patients; the QTc recorded on presentation with COVID-19 was longer than the prior measurement in both groups, but was more prolonged in the deceased group (448.4 ms vs 472.9 ms, pre-COVID vs COVID, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed age, C-reactive protein and prolonged QTc of >455 ms (males) and >465 ms (females) (p = 0.028, HR 1.49 [1.04-2.13]), as predictors of mortality. QTc prolongation beyond these dichotomy limits was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.0027, HR 1.78 [1.2-2.6]).

Many self-report measurement scales are used to assess such risky behaviors. This study is aimed to understand the risky driving behaviors of young adults in Qatar and how such behaviors are associated with crash involvement. This was achieved through the usage of validated self-report measurement scales adopted for the Arabic context. A nationwide cross-sectional and exploratory study was conducted in Qatar from January to April 2021. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey was conducted online. Therefore, respondents were selected conveniently. Hence, the study adopted a non-probability sampling method in which convenience and snowball sampling were used. A total of 253 completed questionnaires were received, of which 57.3% were female, and 42.7% were male. Approximately 55.8% of these young drivers were involved in traffic accidents after obtaining their driving license. On average, most young drivers do have some risky driving behavior accompanied by a low tendency to violate traffic laws, and their driving style is not significantly controlled by their personality on the road. The older young drivers are more involved in traffic accidents than the younger drivers, i.e., around 1.5 times more likely. Moreover, a young male driver is 3.2 times less likely to be involved in traffic accidents than a female driver. In addition, males are only 0.309 times as likely as females to be involved in an accident and have approximately a 70% lower likelihood of having an accident versus females. The analysis is complemented with the association between young drivers demographic background and psychosocial-behavioral parameters (linking risky driving behavior, personality, and obligation effects on crash involvement).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We registered 5969 patients from April 2012 through September 2014, who started receiving alogliptin (group A) or other classes of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs; group B), and were followed for 3 years at 239 sites nationwide. Safety was the primary outcome. Symptomatic hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, skin disorders of non-extrinsic origin, severe infections, and cancer were collected as major adverse events (AEs). Efficacy assessment was the secondary outcome and included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and urinary albumin. RESULTS Of the registered, 5150 (group A: 3395 and group B: 1755) and 5096 (3358 and 1738) were included for safety and efficacy analysis, respectively. Group A patients mostly (>90%) continued to use alogliptin. In group B, biguanides were the primary agents, while DPP-4 inhibitors were added in up to ~36% of patients. The overall incidence of AEs was similar between the two groups (42.7% vs 42.2%). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the incidence of cancer was significantly higher in group A than in group B (7.4% vs 4.8%, p=0.040), while no significant incidence difference was observed in the individual cancer. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the imbalanced patient distribution (more elderly patients in group A than in group B), but not alogliptin usage per se, contributed to cancer development. The incidence of other major AE categories was with no between-group difference. Between-group difference was not detected, either, in the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. HbA1c and fasting glucose decreased significantly at the 0.5-year visit and nearly plateaued thereafter in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Alogliptin as a representative of DPP-4 inhibitors was safe and durably efficacious when used alone or with other OHAs for patients with type 2 diabetes in the real world setting.","output":"Long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 3-year prospective, controlled, observational study (J-BRAND Registry)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drive-through coronavirus disease 2019 screening can evaluate large numbers of patients while reducing healthcare exposures and personal protective equipment use.

However, there are limited data on how disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) alter SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine immunogenicity in patients with autoimmune diseases. Here we investigated the induction and stability of vaccine-specific antibodies, B cells, and T cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients on different DMTs in a prospective cohort study up to 6 months after homologous prime-boost mRNA vaccination. We analysed 103 MS patients of which 86 received anti-CD20-based B cell depletion (aCD20-BCD), fingolimod, interferon-{beta}, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide or natalizumab, and compared them to 17 untreated MS patients. In contrast to all other DMTs and untreated patients, treatment with aCD20-BCD or fingolimod significantly reduced anti-S1 IgG, serum neutralizing activity, and RBD- and S2-specific B cells. MS patients receiving fingolimod additionally lacked S1- and S2-reactive CD4+ T cell responses. The duration of fingolimod treatment, rather than peripheral blood B and T cell counts prior to vaccination, determined whether patients successfully developed humoral immune responses. Fingolimod blocks the ability of immune cells to recirculate and migrate within secondary lymphoid organs demonstrating that functional immune responses require not only immune cells themselves but also access of these cells to the site of inoculation and their unimpeded movement. The absence of humoral and T cell responses in fingolimod-treated MS patients suggests that these patients are at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections despite vaccination, which is highly relevant for clinical decision-making and adapted protective measures, particularly in light of additional recently approved S1P receptor antagonists for MS treatment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination fails to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses in multiple sclerosis patients receiving fingolimod"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study provides site characterization results using passive seismic techniques for the easternmost part of Shillong plateau of Northeastern India.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A web-hosted 21-item cross-sectional survey was distributed to 220 randomly selected patients with a routine appointment in one of the seven departments caring for NCDs in the study center. Descriptive analysis and inferential analyses were done. Paired samples T-test and Pearsons Chi-square test were used study associations. RESULTS: In-person consultations decreased by 1.94.47 visits per year, in 2020 vs 2019. Most participants reported fear of COVID-19 as the primary reason for this decline. Participants also reported that their consultation times had significantly decreased (OR=6.43, 95% CI=1.7C24.08, p=0.006). The decreased consultations time, difficulty in obtaining in-person appointments, along with the reduced physical examination during consultations have made participants more open to the idea of teleconsultations (OR=3.88, 95% CI=1.21C12.47, p=0.022). Eighty-five (38.63%) participants had already adopted telemedicine for their routine consultations during the pandemic. Whilst participants felt that telemedicine was an adequate surrogate for in-person consultations, a significant difficulty in obtaining medications was noted (OR=6, 95% CI=1.34C26.81, p=0.019). CONCLUSION: In-person consultations were decreased primarily due to the perception of significant risk of COVID-19 exposure in the present scenario. Telemedicine adoption in the private sector may be sustainable throughout the pandemic and beyond, if patients are offered to continue their routine consultations with their regular doctors and ensured medicine availability.

We examined whether re-basecalled data would improve the hybrid assembly, and, for a smaller cohort, compared long read (LR) assemblies in the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and mobile genetic elements. We included a cost analysis when comparing SR and LR instruments. We compared the R9 and R10 chemistries and reported not only a larger yield but increased read quality with R9 flow cells. There were often discrepancies with ARG presence/absence and/or variant detection in LR assemblies. Flye-based assemblies were generally efficient at detecting the presence of ARG on both the chromosome and plasmids. Raven performed more quickly but inconsistently recovered small plasmids, notably a 15-kb Col-like plasmid harboring bla(KPC). Canu assemblies were the most fragmented, with genome sizes larger than expected. LR assemblies failed to consistently determine multiple copies of the same ARG as identified by the Unicycler reference. Even with improvements to ONT chemistry and basecalling, long-read assemblies can lead to misinterpretation of data. If LR data are currently being relied upon, it is necessary to perform multiple assemblies, although this is resource (computing) intensive and not yet readily available/useable.","output":"Comparing Long-Read Assemblers to Explore the Potential of a Sustainable Low-Cost, Low-Infrastructure Approach to Sequence Antimicrobial Resistant Bacteria With Oxford Nanopore Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engagement in infection-preventing behaviors (e.g., mask wearing) has become crucial in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and health-related anxiety may be an important determinant of individual compliance with recommended guidelines.

According to recent studies volume should be adjusted in order to achieve complete coverage. However, hand size is a parameter that highly influences the hand coverage quality when using alcohol-based handrubs (ABHR). The purpose of this study was to establish a quantitative correlation between applied ABHR volume and achieved hand coverage. METHOD: ABHR based hand hygiene events were evaluated utilizing a digital health device, the Semmelweis hand hygiene system with respect to coverage achieved on the skin surface. Medical students and surgical residents (N = 356) were randomly selected and given predetermined ABHR volumes. Additionally, hand sizes were calculated using specialized software developed for this purpose. Drying time, ABHR volume awareness, as well spillage awareness were documented for each hand hygiene event. RESULTS: Hand coverage achieved during a hand hygiene event strongly depends on the applied ABHR volume. At a 1 ml dose, the uncovered hand area was approximately 7.10%, at 2 ml it decreased to 1.68%, and at 3 ml it further decreased to 1.02%. The achieved coverage is strongly correlated to hand size, nevertheless, a 3 ml applied volume proved sufficient for most hand hygiene events (84%). When applying a lower amount of ABHR (1.5 ml), even people with smaller hands failed to cover their entire hand surface. Furthermore, a 3 ml volume requires more than the guideline prescribed 20C30 s to dry. In addition, results suggest that drying time is not only affected by hand size, but perhaps other factors may be involved as well (e.g., skin temperature and degree of hydration). ABHR volumes of 3.5 ml or more were inefficient, as the disinfectant spilled while the additional rubbing time did not improve hand coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Hand sizes differ a lot among HCWs. After objectively measuring participants, the surface of the smallest hand was just over half compared to the largest hand (259 cm(2) and 498 cm(2), respectively). While a 3 ml ABHR volume is reasonable for medium-size hands, the need for an optimized volume of handrub for each individual is critical, as it offers several advantages. Not only it can ensure adequate hand hygiene quality, but also prevent unnecessary costs. Bluntly increasing the volume also increases spillage and therefore waste of disinfectant in the case of smaller hands. In addition, adherence could potentially decrease due to the required longer drying time, therefore, adjusting the dosage according to hand size may also increase the overall hand hygiene compliance.","output":"A large-scale investigation of alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) volume: hand coverage correlations utilizing an innovative quantitative evaluation system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study investigated the relationship between generalised trust and psychological well-being in college students, considering the social support obtained from their social networks via Twitter and face-to-face (FTF) interactions. Initially, the authors planned to collect data at the beginning of the first semester in 2019 for fine-tuning the model as a pilot study, and in 2020 for the main study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the data helped authors to analyse changes in young people's psychological situation before and during the pandemic in Japan. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducted a self-report survey targeting college students in the Kanto region in Japan. Data were collected from mid-May to the end of June 2019, as well as in early to mid-June 2020, with 304 and 584 responses, respectively. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modelling and a multiple regression analysis. Findings: The findings using the 2019 data set indicated that (a) students mostly used Twitter for information gathering and sharing of hobbies, and they received both informatics and emotional support from Twitter, and from FTF interactions;(b) there were direct positive effects of generalised trust and social skills on their psychological well-being;and (c) students with lower levels of generalised trust tended to interact with very intimate individuals using Twitter to obtain social support, which did not have any effects on their improvement of psychological well-being. From the 2020 data set, the authors also found that, like 2019, generalised trust and social skills had direct effects on the improvement of psychological well-being. Additionally, we observed that students spent more time using Twitter and received more emotional support from it, as most people tried not to meet other people in person due to the first State of Emergency in Japan. Similarly, the authors found that in 2019, only social support from very intimate partners via FTF communication had slightly significant effects on improving their psychological well-being, whereas in 2020, their expectation for social networks via FTF had decreased their levels of psychological well-being, but their social support from Twitter had slightly significant effects on their improvement of psychological well-being. One of the main reasons for this might be due to the challenge of meeting with others in person, and therefore, social support from Twitter partially played a role that traditionally was only beneficial through FTF communication. Originality/value: We understand that this is one of the few social psychological studies on social media that collected data both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, a meta-analysis was used to examine these hypotheses and the model. Findings The results showed these psychosocial factors indirectly influenced workers' safety performance by impacting on their occupational psychology condition (i.e. burnout and engagement). Work stress, role ambiguity, work-family conflict and interpersonal conflict were negatively related to safety performance by promoting burnout and affecting engagement.

The RBD domain is highly conserved and is also a potential target for blocking its interaction with human cell surface receptors. We extended our previously proposed tACE2 inhibitory peptide approach (that inhibits RBD and ACE2 interaction) to de novo design of shorter peptides. These peptides can selectively bind to RBD with much higher affinities than the cell surface receptors. Thus, these can block all the binding residues required for binding to cell surface receptors. We used selected amino acid regions (21C40 and 65C75) of ACE2 as scaffold for peptide design using EvoDesign. The method mutates the scaffold residues keeping C-backbone of the designed mutant fix, while favorable positioning of mutant R group results in increased binding affinity towards its partner protein. Our designed peptides Pep1 showed interactions with RBD covering almost all of its binding residues with significantly higher binding affinity (-13.2 kcal mol ? 1 ) than the wild type receptors.

CONCLUSION: COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory and imaging studies, and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

Although some evidence has indicated the prognostic values of thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia, there are conflicting results concerning the leukocyte and monocyte count. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective Double Centre study, we reviewed the results of WBC and monocyte counts of 1320 COVID-19 patients (243 of whom (18.4%) had severe disease) both on admission and within a 7-day follow-up. Results: We found that both the number of monocytes and the percentage of monocytosis were higher in the severe group;however, it was not statistically significant. On the other hand, we found that not only the mean number of WBCs was significantly higher in the severe cases also leukocytosis was a common finding in this group;indicating that an increased number of WBC may probably predict a poor prognosis. Also, the monocyte count was not affected by age;however, univariate analysis showed that the percentage of leukocytosis was significantly greater in the older group (>50) with an odds ratio of 1.71 (P: 0.003). Conclusion: Alteration of monocytes either on admission or within hospitalization would not provide valuable data about the prediction of COVID-19 prognosis.

Data was collected over 3 weeks with identical surveys involving four prompts for open-ended responses. Analysis involved sequential explanatory mixed methods where topic modeling, a machine learning technique, was used to identify 21 topics. As categories of experience, these topics were defined and further delineated into 52 dimensions by inductive coding with constant comparison. Reported strengths and positive implications tie predominantly to the topics of Time Management Across a Lab Activity and a Critique of Instruction. Consistent with other reports of teaching and learning during the pandemic, participants perceived Availability of the Teaching Assistant for Help as a positive implication. Perceptions of weakness were most associated with Having to Work Individually, the Hands On Experience, a Critique of Instruction, and Learning by Doing. Hands on Experience, which was interpreted as the lack thereof, was the only topic made up nearly entirely of weaknesses and negative implications. The topic of Learning by Doing was the topic of greatest occurrence, but was equally indicated as strengths, positive implication, weakness, and negative implication. Ramifications are drawn from the weaknesses indicated by students who identified as members of an underrepresented ethnic minority.

METHOD An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs. RESULTS A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor.

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established.

Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological (including plasma cytokines) features were assessed. Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response but higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels. NEFAs and PUFAs concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ventilator-free days. Among hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, COVID-19 is independently associated with higher NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) and lower apolipoprotein E and HDL concentrations.

Despite this, the vaccination rate in pregnant women is low in Italy. The COVID-19 pandemic has focused the attention of public opinion on communicable diseases, underlining the importance of primary prevention measures such as vaccination. We conducted a survey to investigate the behavior of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding maternal immunization to identify the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in order to overcome them. The new challenge is COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, and preliminary data show hesitancy towards it. Our analysis may be useful to improve immunization in the pregnant population, including through the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: A targeted survey was performed in Italy including 520 women who experienced in the first trimester of pregnancy, prior to the novel coronavirus spread, the 2019C2020 influenza vaccination campaign and the Tdap vaccine recommendation in the third trimester during the COVID pandemic. They represent a unique model to investigate if the new coronavirus outbreak might have changed attitudes towards vaccination in pregnancy in the same patients. Data were collected from a self-completed paper questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were calculated and percentages were compared using the chi-2 test or Fishers exact test. Results: We obtained data from 195 of the 520 women who gave birth during the inclusion period; 325 cases declined to participate in the survey. A total of 8.7% (17 cases) performed flu vaccination in the first trimester of pregnancy (pre-COVID era), 50.8% (99 cases) accepted Tdap immunization during their third trimester of gestation (COVID-19 pandemic) and 6.7% (13 cases) received both vaccines during pregnancy. For both the flu and Tdap shots, pregnant patients were more likely to accept the vaccines if they were recommended by a healthcare provider, whereas the main reason not to be vaccinated was the lack of such a recommendation. Conclusions: Our survey shows that the COVID-19 experience, which has raised awareness as to the role of vaccines in preventable diseases, may positively change attitudes toward immunization in pregnancy. Vaccination must be recommended to all pregnant women and organized during routine prenatal care as an important element for the prevention of communicable diseases. Vaccination hesitancy can be minimized through consistent recommendation to all pregnant women offered by obstetric staff during routine prenatal care. This approach is likely to be effective in terms of building trust in flu and Tdpa immunization among pregnant women, as well as to avoid unjustified hesitancy towards the more recent COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Flu and Tdap Maternal Immunization Hesitancy in Times of COVID-19: An Italian Survey on Multiethnic Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide, and new treatments are direly needed. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) has been proposed as a potential target to prevent and reverse NAFLD. NAD+ is an important redox factor for energy metabolism and is used as a substrate by a range of enzymes, including sirtuins (SIRT), which regulates histone acetylation, transcription factor activity and mitochondrial function. NAD+ is also a precursor for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is an important component of the antioxidant defense system. NAD+ precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are available as over-the-counter dietary supplements, and oral supplementation with these precursors increases hepatic NAD+ levels and prevent hepatic lipid accumulation in pre-clinical models of NAFLD. Moreover, NAD+ precursors were found to improve hepatic mitochondrial function and decrease oxidative stress in pre-clinical NAFLD models. NAD+ repletion also prevents NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as NAD+ precursor supplementation is associated with decreased hepatic stellate cell activation, and decreased fibrosis. However, initial clinical trials have only shown modest effects when NAD+ precursors were administrated to people with obesity. We review the available pre-clinical investigations of NAD+ supplementation for targeting NAFLD, and discuss how data from the first clinical trials can be reconciled with observations from preclinical research.

Hence, increasing its nutritional value can largely handle the malnutrition issues of the growing population. In the past few decades, different biofortification techniques including conventional breeding, transgenic approach, and agronomic biofortification have been largely employed for increasing the nutrient content in wheat grains. However, all of these techniques have their own drawbacks such as environmental hazards, long time requirement, reduced acceptability etc. Thus, nanobiofortification of wheat crop has gained interest as an efficient alternative strategy to achieve nutritional gains. However, there is still a long way forward to effectively utilize nanotechnology for wheat nutritional development. In this scenario, a review on the current advancement in wheat nanobiofortification is highly required so that the lacking points in this research area can be identified and accomplished. However, such a review article has been missing so far. This review describes the progress in the use of nanomaterials for wheat biofortification till date. It will help the scientific community to identify the lack in this research area and widely implement the nanotechnology to biofortify wheat crops. ABSTRACT: The deficiency of nutrients in food crops is a major issue affecting the health of human beings, mainly in underdeveloped areas. Despite the development in the methods of food fortification, several barriers such as lack of proper regulations and smaller public-private partnerships hinder its successful implementation in society. Consequently, genetic and agronomic biofortification has been suggested as the potential techniques for fortifying the nutrients in diets. However, the time-consuming nature and restricted available diversity in the targeted crop gene pool limit the benefits of genetic biofortification. In agronomic biofortification, organic fertilizers face the problem of prolonged duration of nutrients release and lesser content of minerals; while in inorganic fertilizers, the large-sized fertilizers (greater than 100 nm) suffer from volatilization and leaching losses. The application of nanotechnology in agriculture holds enormous potential to cope with these challenges. The utility of nanomaterials for wheat biofortification gains its importance by supplying the appropriate dose of fertilizer at the appropriate time diminishing the environmental concerns and smoothening the process of nutrient uptake and absorption. Wheat is a major crop whose nano-biofortification can largely handle the issue of malnutrition and nutrients deficiency in human beings. Though several research experiments have been conducted at small levels to see the effects of nano-biofortification on wheat plants, a review article providing an overview of such studies and summarizing the benefits and outcomes of wheat nano-biofortification is still lacking. Although a number of review articles are available on the role of nanotechnology in wheat crop, these are mostly focused on the role of nanoparticles in alleviating biotic and abiotic stress conditions in wheat. None of them focused on the prospects of nanotechnology for wheat biofortification. Hence, in this review for the first time, the current advancement in the employment of different nanotechnology-based approaches for wheat biofortification has been outlined. Different strategies including the supply of nano-based macro- and micronutrients that have shown promising results for wheat improvement have been discussed in detail. Understanding several aspects related to the safe usage of nanomaterials and their future perspectives may enhance their successful utilization in terms of economy and fulfillment of nutritional requirements following wheat nano-biofortification.","output":"Insight into the Prospects for Nanotechnology in Wheat Biofortification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is evolving from an abstract array of non-specific symptoms to an identifiable clinical entity of variable severity. Its frequency and persistence have implications for service delivery and workforce planning. AIMS: This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of symptoms consistent with PCS and the subjective degree of recovery in a cohort of healthcare workers, focusing on those who have returned to work. METHODS: A study population of 1176 was surveyed when attending for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody testing. Two sub-groups were identified: those with known (i.e. diagnosed on PCR testing) and assumed (i.e. antibody evidence of previous infection) SARs-CoV-2 infection, at least 12 weeks prior to the study. Each group was asked about their subjective degree of recovery and the nature of their persistent symptoms. Results were analysed via excel and SPSS. RESULTS: In total, 144 employees showed PCR evidence of previous infection, with 139 of these being infected at least 12 weeks prior to the study. Of these 139, only 19% (n = 26) reported feeling 100% recovered, and 71% reported persistent symptoms.

The identification of potential miRNA-targeted gene axes could act as targets for developing novel treatment strategies. Herein, it was assessed that miR-488 expression was markedly downregulated within pancreatic carcinoma. Higher expression of miR-488 was shown to be linked to better prognosis rates of pancreatic carcinoma as per online data. Within two pancreatic tumor cells, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1, miR-488 overexpression significantly suppressed malignant cytological behavior by inhibiting cell viability, enhancing cell apoptosis, and inducing cell cycle G2/M-phase arrest. Moreover, miR-488 overexpression also decreased the protein levels of cell cycle regulators, including cyclin A, cyclin B, CDK1, and CDK2. miR-488 directly targets ERBB2 (receptor tyrosine-protein kinase2) to suppress the expression of ERBB2 by targeting its 3'UTR. ERBB2 knockdown in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines suppressed, but miR-488 inhibition enhanced the cancer cell biological malignant behavior; the effects of miR-488 inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells were significantly reversed by ERBB2 knockdown. NF-B suppressed the expression of miR-488 transcriptionally via targeting its promoter region, consequentially repressing the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-488 upon pancreatic tumor cells. Thus, an NF-B/miR-488/ERBB2 axis modulating pancreatic cancer cell malignancy and tumor growth through cell cycle signaling was conclusively demonstrated.","output":"The NF-B/miR-488/ERBB2 axis modulates pancreatic cancer cell malignancy and tumor growth through cell cycle signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-COV-2 is a novel coronavirus which is the etiological agent of the COVID-19 infection The neurosurgical practice is not exempted from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Awake craniotomy in a COVID-19 positive patient pose a significant risk for theatre staff but intubation of a COVID-19 positive patient for surgery under general anesthesia also pose similar risk Method Federal Teaching Hospital Ido Ekiti is a tertiary hospital in suburban community in Southwest Nigeria with 300-bed capacity The hospital is a designated COVID-19 treatment centre A 69-year-old female patient was referred from a nearby COVID-19 treatment hospital on account of left parieto-occipital high grade glioma She had awake craniotomy and gross total tumor excision Result There was no need to convert to general anesthesia and she had immediate post-operative neurological improvement Repeat COVID-19 test on post-operative day 4 was negative and she was discharged home Thirty-day post-operative review confirmed progressive motor gain Conclusion Awake craniotomy in COVID-19 positive patient with appropriate use of necessary PPEs is achievable","output":"Awake craniotomy in a Covid-19 positive patient: The challenges and outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We explored potential predictive variables associated with outcomes using baseline clinical parameters of 500 hospitalised patients with COVID -19 in a single centre, UK.

Whether vitamin D3 supplementation reduces severe childhood asthma exacerbations is unclear. Objective: To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation improves the time to a severe exacerbation in children with asthma and low vitamin D levels. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Vitamin D to Prevent Severe Asthma Exacerbations (VDKA) Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin D3 supplementation to improve the time to severe exacerbations in high-risk children with asthma aged 6 to 16 years taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. Participants were recruited from 7 US centers. Enrollment started in February 2016, with a goal of 400 participants; the trial was terminated early (March 2019) due to futility, and follow-up ended in September 2019. Interventions: Participants were randomized to vitamin D3, 4000 IU/d (n = 96), or placebo (n = 96) for 48 weeks and maintained with fluticasone propionate, 176 g/d (6-11 years old), or 220 g/d (12-16 years old). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants in whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced halfway through the trial, and the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Results: Among 192 randomized participants (mean age, 9.8 years; 77 girls [40%]), 180 (93.8%) completed the trial. A total of 36 participants (37.5%) in the vitamin D3 group and 33 (34.4%) in the placebo group had 1 or more severe exacerbations. Compared with placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation did not significantly improve the time to a severe exacerbation: the mean time to exacerbation was 240 days in the vitamin D3 group vs 253 days in the placebo group (mean group difference, -13.1 days [95% CI, -42.6 to 16.4]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.85]; P = .63). Vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, likewise did not significantly improve the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants whose dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced, or the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Serious adverse events were similar in both groups (vitamin D3 group, n = 11; placebo group, n = 9). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels, vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. The findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in this group of patients.

Methods: In a crossover design, participants (17 men and 18 women) underwent a progressive square-wave test at four intensities (i. at 80% of the ventilatory anerobic threshold [80%VAT]; ii. at VAT; iii. at the respiratory compensation point [RCP]; iv. at exercise peak [Peak] to exhaustion), with or without a triple-layered cloth mask (Mask or No-Mask). Several physiological, metabolic and perceptual measures were analyzed. Results: Mask reduced inspiratory capacity at all exercise intensities vs. No-Mask (p<0.0001), irrespective of sex. Mask reduced respiratory frequency vs. No-Mask (p=0.001) at Peak (-8.3 breaths/min; CI: -5.8, -10.8), RCP (-6.9 breaths/min; CI: -4.6, -9.2) and VAT (-6.5 breaths/min; CI: -4.1, -8.8), but not at Baseline or at 80%VAT. Mask also reduced tidal volume (p<0.0001) at both RCP (-0.5L; CI: -0.3, -0.6) and Peak (-0.8L; CI: -0.6, -0.9), but not at Baseline, 80%VAT or VAT. Shallow breathing index was increased with Mask at Peak compared to No-Mask (11.3; CI: 7.5, 15.1), but not at any other intensities. Mask did not change heart rate, lactate, ratings of perceived exertion, blood pressure or oxygen saturation. Conclusions: Wearing a cloth facemask during exercise at moderate to heavy intensities is unlikely to incur significant respiratory or cardiovascular changes, irrespective of sex. These data can inform new exercise recommendations for health during the COVID-19 pandemic and debunk unfounded allegations of harmful effects of masks during exercise.

At our institute, patient-facing paediatric ENT appointments were replaced with telemedical consultations. METHOD We performed a prospective analysis of the outcomes following telephone consultations with parents and describe our experience of remote consulting during a pandemic, and the possibilities for future applications of telemedicine in paediatric ENT. RESULTS 215 patients were appropriately referred to the paediatric ENT clinic, 65% of these patients were deemed suitable for remote telephone consultation. Following a telephone call, 50% did not need further ENT clinic management, most commonly due to being listed for surgery (20%) or discharged (18%). The treating consultant assessed 81% of phone consultations as being effective. When given the choice, patients reported that 29% would choose a telephone consultation whilst 43% preferred a face to face consultation. CONCLUSION Our experience has shown that there are areas of paediatric ENT that can be streamlined effectively by substituting face to face consultations with telephone consultations. However, prospective evaluation of these remote contacts suggest that telephone consultations are not a panacea and cannot be indiscriminately applied to all. Instead, the strategies to take forwards into a post Covid19 practice are vetting of referrals, individualised treatment plans, and giving patients a choice.","output":"Telemedicine in paediatric otorhinolaryngology: Lessons learnt from remote encounters during the Covid19 pandemic and implications for future practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represented a stressful event. OBJECTIVES: The incidence of newly diagnosed Mnire's disease (MD) patients before and during COVID-19 at our Institution was calculated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The period 2018-2020 was considered. Incidence was calculated as number of annual first MD diagnoses divided by the number of annual first audiological evaluations. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were considered. Annual incidence of MD at our institution was 1.3% in 2018, 1.2% in 2019, and 3.2% in 2020, resulting in a significant increase during COVID-19 pandemic (2018 vs. 2020, p=.00001; 2019 vs. 2020, p=.00001).

This case-control study seeks to shed light on the true risk of autoimmune AEFIs associated with the COVID-19 vaccine through a case-control analysis of VAERS reports. Reports of autoimmune aetiology were matched with reports of non-autoimmune controls. Statistical analysis reveals that the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines with regard to autoimmune AEFIs is highly favourable. In particular, neuroautoimmune AEFIs have statistically significant reporting odds ratios below unity (Guillain-Barre syndrome: 0.35, multiple sclerosis: 0.70, transverse myelitis: 0.79), indicating a reduced association of reports of these conditions with the COVID-19 vaccine versus other vaccines. Only three autoimmune aetiologies exceed a ROR of 2.0 and thus present a potential signal. Of these, myasthenia gravis (ROR = 3.90, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 2.63-5.80) may be the result of epidemiological confounding factors not sufficiently controlled by matching, as the population most likely to develop myasthenia gravis was strongly prioritised in the COVID-19 vaccine's initial rollout. Immune thrombocytopaenia (ROR = 26.83, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 16.93-42.54) is a clear safety signal, confirming a large number of case reports and studies that indicate a risk of immune thrombocytopaenic events following the COVID- 19 vaccine. The lone strong safety signal of immune thrombocytopaenia notwithstanding, this study attests to the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine where autoimmune conditions are concerned. Through quantifying the risk of autoimmune disorders associated with COVID-19 vaccination, this study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the safety of such vaccines.","output":"A case-control study of autoimmune AEFIs following COVID-19 vaccination reported to VAERS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computers find application in virtually all aspect of human existence, especially in todays modern world. Although this comes with a lot of benefits, it also comes with a number of undesirable consequences. Chief among these consequences is the rising concerns for security of information and even loss of privacy. Steganography, an Information hiding technique could be a fitting solution to these security issues. This paper presents an improved Steganography technique for ensuring the security of the widely spread and used internet materials or information that are shared globally with risk of vulnerability of attack. In this current research work, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Steganography were combined together to achieve effective security in the proposed system. A given plain text or secret message is first converted to a cipher text using ECC. The resultant encrypted text is then hidden under a cover-image using DCT-based image steganography technique to produce a final output called stego-image. To the Human Visual System (HVS), the stego-image remains the same as the original cover image. This ensures that the hidden secret message gets delivered to the target recipient without any suspicion. Standard metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE), as well as average computation time, were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed steganography system. The results indicate better performance compared to the conventional steganography systems. Thus the proposed system is a 2-level steganography system effective for storing sensitive data and even for securely transferring information over an open/enterprise network.","output":"A Two-Layer Image-Steganography System for Covert Communication Over Enterprise Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus described, was initially associated with severe respiratory disease. However, outbreaks have more recently also been associated with nephropathogenesis. Topographically interrelated antigenic determinants of the nephropathogenic Gray strain of IBV were characterized using eleven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Four MAbs (IgG 2a) defined epitopes that were both conformation-independent and group specific, reacting with Gray, Arkansas (Ark), and Massachusetts 41 (Mass 41) strains. Seven MAbs (IgG 1) defined conformation-dependent epitopes that could differentiate the Gray from the Ark and Mass strains. The spike protein specificity of the MAbs was determined with the conformation-independent MAbs and one MAb that reacted only in non-denaturing western blot assays. Competitive binding studies using these MAbs suggested a high degree of functional dependency among the associated epitopes as might be expected with a protein of complex secondary and tertiary structure. At least two regions associated with complete protection of infected embryos were identified that consisted of both conformation-dependent and independent epitopes. However, a non-neutralizing MAb, which did not protect the embryo from gross lesions, did inhibit virus-induced lesions and replication in the kidneys. These MAbs should be valuable tools in studying IBV pathogenesis.","output":"Epitopes on the spike protein of a nephropathogenic strain of infectious bronchitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human choline dehydrogenase (CHD) is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria primarily in liver and kidney and catalyzes the oxidation of choline to glycine betaine. Its physiological role is to regulate the concentrations of choline and glycine betaine in the blood and cells. Choline is important for regulation of gene expression, the biosynthesis of lipoproteins and membrane phospholipids and for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine; glycine betaine plays important roles as a primary intracellular osmoprotectant and as methyl donor for the biosynthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a required step for the synthesis of the ubiquitous methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. Recently, CHD has generated considerable medical attention due to its association with various human pathologies, including male infertility, homocysteinuria, breast cancer and metabolic syndrome.

In this paper, we propose a new solving technique that allows Sketch to handle large integer values while retaining its integer encoding. Our technique uses a result from number theory, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, to rewrite program sketches to only track the remainders of certain variable values with respect to several prime numbers. We prove that our transformation is sound and the encoding of the resulting programs are exponentially more succinct than existing Sketch encodings.

However, the current development in Swedish primary care is to blend digital solutions with traditional solutions. This paper addresses this development by examining the normalization of embedding and integrating a digital health care platform into everyday care routines in a primary care clinic. The digital health care platform enables both synchronous (video calls) and asynchronous (chat) communication, as well as self-registration of patient data using automated questions and forms requiring the patients input. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the work that health care professionals (HCPs) have to undertake to implement and sustain a digital health care platform as part of their everyday work practice. METHODS: HCPs were observed and interviewed to assess their individual and collective engagement and the mechanisms involved in the implementation of the digital platform and its effects on everyday work routines. The normalization process theory (NPT) was used to frame the data analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified several themes related to the four NPT constructs: coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring. The use of these constructs enabled the analysis to identify ways of supporting implementation. For example, it showed the benefits of having implementation champions and scheduling work hours for HCPs to use the platform. The analysis also revealed a theme of materiality that deviated from the NPT constructs, as NPT gives ontological priority to human actors and social structures. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health care platform implementation is a complex process. Our findings provide insights into how individual and collective actions can be supported to embed and integrate a digital platform into everyday care routines. Primary health care organizations need to involve HCPs throughout the implementation process by reorganizing work and providing frequent feedback loops. HCPs are more likely to engage with and commit to changing practices if they perceive the digital platform to be beneficial compared with the current practice. However, they also need resources (eg, time, training, and continuous support) to put the platform into practice. Patient engagement and appraisal are important elements in implementation. Unless patients are willing to use the platform, there is no motivation for HCPs to embed the digital platform into everyday care practice.","output":"Embedding and Integrating a Digital Patient Management Platform Into Everyday Primary Care Routines: Qualitative Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Diachasmimorpha longicaudata entomopoxvirus (DlEPV) is the first symbiotic EPV described from a parasitic wasp. The DlEPV is introduced into the tephritid fruit fly larval host along with the wasp egg at oviposition. We sequenced a shotgun genomic library of the DlEPV DNA and analyzed and compared the predicted protein sequences of eight ORFs with those of selected poxviruses and other organisms. BlastP searches showed that five of these are homologous to poxvirus putative proteins such as metalloprotease, a putative membrane protein, late transcription factor-3, virion surface protein, and poly (A) polymerase (PAP) regulatory small subunit. Three of these are similar to those of other organisms such as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) of Arabidopsis thaliana, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) of Caenorhabditis briggsae and lambda phage integrase ([Formula: see text]-Int) of Enterococcus faecium. Transcription motifs for early (TGA,A/T,XXXXA) or late (TAAATG, TAAT, or TAAAT) gene expression conserved in poxviruses were identified with those ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments of five ORFs and 20 poxvirus homologous sequences and of a concatenate of multiple alignments suggested that DlEPV probably diverged from the ancestral node between the fowlpox virus and the genus B, lepidopteran and orthopteran EPVs, to which Amsacta moorei and Melanoplus sanguinipes EPV, respectively, belong. The DlEPV putative GGT, eIF4A, and [Formula: see text]-Int contained many conserved domains that typified these proteins.

However, they have not issued any guidelines for the safe establishment and operation of an HMB. This gap contributes to the demand for gathering experiences from HMB networks, especially those from lower-middle income countries. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the characteristics of donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients during the first four years of operation in the first HMB in Vietnam. Methods: Data about the donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients were extracted from the web-based electronic monitoring system of the HMB from 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2021. Results: In the first four years of operation there were 433 donors who donated 7642 L of milk (66% from the community) with an increased trend in the amount of donated milk, donation duration, and average amount of milk donated by a donor. Approximately 98% of the donated milk was pasteurized, and 82% passed both pre- and post-pasteurization tests. Although the pass rate tended to increase with time, a few dips occurred. Of 16,235 newborns who received pasteurized donor milk, two thirds were in the postnatal wards. The main reason for the prescription of pasteurized donor milk was insufficient mothers own milk in the first few days after birth.

While many recognized pathophysiological mechanisms are involved, their exact causal relationships remain opaque. A better understanding is needed for predicting their progression, targeting therapeutic approaches, and improving patient outcomes. While many mathematical causal models describe COVID-19 epidemiology, none have been developed for its pathophysiology. The virus's rapid and extensive spread and therapeutic responses made this particularly difficult. Initially, no large patient datasets were publicly available, and their data remains limited. The medical literature was flooded with unfiltered, technical and sometimes conflicting pre-review reports. Clinicians in many countries had little time for academic consultations, and in-person meetings were unsafe. Methods and Findings In early 2020, we began a major project to develop causal models of the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease's clinical manifestations. We used Bayesian network (BN) models, because they provide both powerful tools for calculation and clear maps of probabilistic causal influence between semantically meaningful variables, as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Hence, they can incorporate expert opinion and numerical data, and produce explainable results. Dynamic causal BNs, which represent successive \\"time slices\\" of the system, can capture feedback loops and long-term disease progression. To obtain the likely causal structures, we used extensive elicitation of expert opinion in structured online sessions. Centered in Australia, with its exceptionally low COVID-19 burden, we managed to obtain many consultation hours. Groups of clinical and other subject matter specialists, all independent volunteers, were enlisted to filter, interpret and discuss the literature and develop a current consensus. We aimed to capture the experts' understanding, so we encouraged discussion and inclusion of theoretically salient latent (i.e., unobservable) variables, documented supporting literature while noting controversies, and allowed experts to propose mechanisms by extrapolation from other diseases. Intermediary experts with some combined expertise facilitated the exchange of knowledge to BN modelers and vice versa. Our method was iterative and incremental: we systematically refined and checked the group output with one-on-one follow-up meetings with the original and new experts to validate previous results. In total, 35 experts contributed 126 face-to-face hours, and could review our products. Conclusions Our method demonstrates and describes an improved procedure for developing BNs via expert elicitation, which can be implemented rapidly by other teams modeling emergent complex phenomena. The results presented are two key models, for the initial infection of the respiratory tract and the possible progression to complications, as causal DAGs and BNs with corresponding verbal descriptions, dictionaries and sources. These are the first published causal models of COVID-19 pathophysiology, with three anticipated applications: (i) making expert knowledge freely available in a readily understandable and updatable form; (ii) guiding design and analysis of observational and clinical studies, by identifying potential mediators, confounders, and modifiers of treatment effects; (iii) developing and validating parameterized automated tools for causal reasoning and decision support, in clinical and policy settings.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether fellowship video conference interviews (VCIs) are an acceptable alternative to in-person interviews from both the applicant and program perspectives. METHODS: Applicants and faculty from a single academic institution with five OBGYN subspecialty fellowship programs were invited to complete surveys regarding their experience using VCIs during the 2020 interview season. Survey responses used a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Comparative analyses between faculty and applicants responses to survey questions were performed with two-tailed Students t-tests. RESULTS: 45 faculty members and 131 applicants received the survey. Response rate for faculty members and applicants was 95.6% (n = 43) and 46.6% (n = 61), respectively. Faculty and applicants agreed that the VCIs allowed them to accurately represent themselves (83.7% vs. 88.6%, p = 0.48). Most applicants (62.3%, n = 38) reported a fundamental understanding of the fellowships culture. The majority of applicants (77.1%, n = 47) and faculty (72.1%, n = 31) agreed that they were able to develop connections during the virtual interview (p = 0.77). Faculty and applicants stated that VCIs assisted them in determining whether the candidate or program, respectively, was a good fit (83.7% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The VCI fellowship recruitment process allowed OBGYN fellowship applicants and programs to accurately represent themselves compared to in-person interviews. Most applicants and faculty were able to develop relationships over the virtual platform. Although not explicitly assessed, it is possible that the virtual interviews can achieve a suitable match between applicant and program across all OBGYN subspecialty fellowships. The VCI process may be a long-term resolution to minimize both the financial burden and time commitment presented by traditional in-person interviews.

The model also considers age-specific vaccine coverage data, vaccine efficacy against different clinical endpoints, waning of immunity, different antiviral therapies, and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

AOM is characterized by tympanic membrane swelling or otorrhea and is accompanied by signs or symptoms of ear infection. In COM, there is a tympanic membrane perforation and purulent discharge. The most common pathogens that cause AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with COM. Innate and adaptive immune responses provide protection against OM. However, pathogens employ a wide arsenal of weapons to evade potent immune responses and these mechanisms likely contribute to AOM and COM.

ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Cytokine storm syndrome (CTS) is a serious complication of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whIth STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in two cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1254 vs. 925microg/L; p=0.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; p = 0.007).

Since the virus emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, several new mutations have been described. The World Health Organization has developed a working name for these emerging variants according to their impact on the worldwide population. In this context a high alert has been paid to variants of concern (VOC) due to their high infectiousness and transmissibility patterns. The most recent VOC, Omicron (B.1.1.529), has become dominant in the shortest time ever and has placed Europe under an overwhelming and unprecedented number of new cases. This variant has numerous mutations in regions that are associated with higher transmissibility, stronger viral binding, affinity and antibody escape. Moreover, the mutations and deletions present in the spike protein suggest that the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 specific attachment inhibitors may not be the best option for Omicron therapy. Omicron is the dominant variant circulating worldwide and, at the end of February 2022, it was responsible for nearly all sequences reported to GISAID. Omicron is made up of several sublineages, where the most common are BA.1 and BA.2 (or Nextstrain clade 21K and 21L, respectively). At a global level, it is possible to say that the proportion of BA.2 has been increasing relative to BA.1 and in some countries it has been replacing it at high rates. In order to better assess the Omicron effectiveness on antibody escape, spread and infectious ability it is of the highest relevance to maintain a worldwide tight surveillance. Even though this variant has been associated with a lower death rate, it is important to highlight that the number of people becoming infected is concerning and that further unpredictable mutations may emerge as the number of infected people rises.","output":"Omicron C The new SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 challenge?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed multiple restrictions on healthcare services. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the pandemic on Allergy & Immunology (A&I) services in the UK. METHODS: National survey of all A&I services registered with the Royal College of Physicians and/or British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The survey covered staffing, facilities, personal protective equipment, appointments & patient review, investigations, treatments and research activity. Weeks commencing 03 Feb'20 (pre-COVID), 06 April'20 and 08'May'20 were used as reference points for the dataset. RESULTS: 99 services participated. There was a reduction in nursing, medical, administrative and allied health professional staff during pandemic; 86% and 92% of A&I services continued to accept non-urgent and urgent referrals respectively during the pandemic. There were changes in immunoglobulin (Ig) dose and infusion regimen in 67% and 14% of adult and pediatric services respectively; 30% discontinued immunoglobulin replacement in some patients. There was a significant (all variables, p&#8804;0.0001) reduction in the following: face-to-face consultations (increase in telephone consultations), initiation of venom immunotherapy, sublingual and subcutaneous injection immunotherapy, anesthetic allergy testing and hospital procedures (food challenges, immunoglobulin and omalizumab, administration); and a significant increase (p&#8804;0.0001) in home therapy for immunoglobulin and omalizumab. Adverse clinical outcomes were reported, but none were serious. CONCLUSION: The pandemic had significant impact on A&I services leading to multiple unplanned pragmatic amendments in service delivery.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 to June 23, 2020 using a multi-pronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey questions included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1,297 Asian American respondents, only 3% were tested, and 49% stated that they could not find a place to get tested. Three-quarters of respondents reported feeling stressed, and about 23% reported feeling depressed. About 6% of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32% had lost their regular jobs and 23% had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70% of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their homes to go to public places (e.g., grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans reported lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (e.g., not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the COVID-19 impact on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally- and linguistically-appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services.

In spite of lack of solid evidence, certain federal governments had recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), chloroquine, and azithromycin as prophylactic medications either for contacts or for healthcare providers in particular. The objective of this study is to assess the issues related to intake of prophylactic medications in view of COVID-19 and the proportion and pattern of side effects. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using mixed methods approach among healthcare workers in Puducherry, India. RESULTS: HCQ was the prophylactic drug taken by all the participants (n = 26). Of the 26, 15.4% had a baseline ECG, 26.9% took HCQ based on the recommended Day 1 dose of 800 mg and 61.5% of the participants had the drug provided by the hospital where they work. Reasons for taking prophylaxis were sense of vulnerability (due to co-morbidities, lack of PPE kits) and peer practice. However, the participants did not recommend prophylactic medication to others due to lack of evidence, death claims related to prophylactic drugs in media, hospitals not taking responsibility of baseline monitoring and need for long follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The data on assessment of HCQ prophylaxis indicates only minor side-effects, though limited by sample size. Evidence-based recommendations on prophylactic drugs for COVID-19, effective risk communication, peer education and support, accountability, ease of baseline, and follow-up investigations were the need of the hour to improve intake and adherence to prophylactic regime for COVID-19.","output":"Prophylactic Medications Taken by Healthcare Workers for COVID-19; A Mixed Methods Study from South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a large increase in mortality and morbidity associated with respiratory diseases.

The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May, 2020. GBMSM were recruited through advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 518 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes three in self-reported measures of sexual behavior: number of sex partners, number of anal sex partners and number of anal sex partners not protected by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or condoms. Approximately two-thirds of the sample reported that they believed it was possible to contract COVID-19 through sex, with anal sex reported as the least risky sex act. Men did not generally feel it was important to reduce their number of sex partners during COVID-19, but reported a moderate willingness to have sex during COVID-19. For the period between February and April-May 20,202, participants reported a mean increase of 2.3 sex partners during COVID-19, a mean increase of 2.1 anal sex partners (range - 40 to 70), but a very small increase in the number of unprotected anal sex partners. Increases in sexual behavior during COVID-19 were associated with increases in substance use during the same period. High levels of sexual activity continue to be reported during the COVID-19 lockdown period and these high levels of sexual activity are often paralleled by increases in substance use and binge drinking.

The media play a major role shaping these responses. When dealing with a PHEIC, the authorities communication strategies are embedded in a multilevel governance and a highly hierarchal system, which adds another layer of complexity. Carrying out more real-world research is crucial to generate evidence relating to the psychosocial and behavioral aspects involved during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is shaped by authorities and media discourses. Interdisciplinary research and international collaborations could contribute to improve our understanding and management of risk information.

METHODS: We enrolled all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection admitted to Tongji Hospital from February 1 to February 29, 2020. Data of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The characteristics of liver function and its relation with the severity and prognosis of disease were described. RESULTS: Of 105 SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infected patients, elevated levels of liver test were seen in several patients at admission, including elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (22, 20.95%), aspartate aminotransferase (29, 27.62%), total bilirubin (7, 6.67%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (7, 6.67%), and alkaline phosphatase (1, 0.95%). The values of the indices mentioned above increased substantially during hospitalization (all P < .05). Fourteen (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. Most of them (10, 71.43%) recovered after 8 (range 6-21) days. Notably, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure. The proportion of severe COVID-19 was higher in patients with liver injury (P = .042). Complications including ACLF, acute cardiac injury and shock happened more frequently in patients with liver injury (all P < .05). The mortality was higher in individuals with liver injury (28.57% vs 3.30%, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Liver injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and chronic HBV co-infection was associated with severity and poor prognosis of disease.

Gait motor disorder is one of the critical manifestations of PD, and automated assessment of gait is vital to realize automated assessment of PD patients. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream spatial-temporal attention graph convolutional network (2s-ST-AGCN) for video assessment of PD gait motor disorder. Specifically, the skeleton sequence of human body is extracted from videos to construct spatial-temporal graphs of joints and bones, and a two-stream spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is then built to simultaneously model the static spatial information and dynamic temporal variations. The multi-scale spatial-temporal attention-aware mechanism is also designed to effectively extract the discriminative spatial-temporal features. The deep supervision strategy is then embedded to minimize classification errors, thereby guiding the weight update process of the hidden layer to promote significant discriminative features. Besides, two model-driven terms are integrated into this deep learning framework to strengthen multi-scale similarity in the deep supervision and realize sparsification of discriminative features. Extensive experiments on the clinical video dataset show that the proposed model exhibits good performance with an accuracy of 65.66% and an acceptable accuracy of 98.90%, which is much better than that of the existing sensor- and vision-based methods for Parkinsonian gait assessment.

Although it is not the case, the distribution of prices in the contemporary city is a big deal for policy-makers and urban planners as well. Especially in metropolitan areas, where polarization of services is needed, the high complexity of urban scenarios makes the prediction of price variation due to change in the morphology or in the offer of services (for example in transportation and accessibility) very unreliable, despite of the success of policy and planning actions is strictly related to its control. This paper, moving in this perspective, points out some evidences on the relationships between the quali-quantitative structure of the city and the fluctuation of real estate prices with reference to house market, under the idea of investigating what is the role of urban railway stations. As a matter of fact, railway stations are nodes of the transport network as well places of the urban environment whose big impact on accessibility in the city and the corresponding contribution in the definition of property values is very intuitive. The findings on the effects of railway stations on property values are mixed, since they vary on magnitude and direction. This paper focuses on the comparison of the impact of urban railway stations on the residential estate property values as well on the structure of the city in itself, grasped in terms of configurational state. To this aim, the paper proposes a case study, evaluating how the correlation among configurational indexes and residential values distribution varies with and without the presence of the railway system. The main findings of the work make to arise a marginal or negative impact of the railway system, so as to promote the idea that other factors dominates the change in local property values around railway stations.

Intergenerational coresidence and interdependence among family members, both prevalent in Brazil, likely increase social and physical contact and thus potential infection. METHODS: Using nationally representative data from the COVID-19 module of the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domiclios), collected between July and November of 2020, we examined the association between living arrangements and exposure to and testing for COVID-19 among 63,816 Brazilians aged 60 years and older. We examine whether living arrangements influence self-reported COVID-19 symptoms as an indicator of subjective health assessment, testing as an indicator of health care service use, and a positive COVID-19 test result as an objective indicator of exposure to the disease. RESULTS: Living arrangements shape older adults vulnerabilities to COVID-19 exposure and testing. Specifically, those living alone were more likely to report having symptoms and having had a test for COVID-19. However, older adults in multigenerational and skipped generation households were more likely than solo-dwellers to test positive for COVID-19. Those with symptoms were more likely to test, regardless of their living arrangement. Among older adults without symptoms, those living alone had a higher probability of testing than those living in multigenerational or skipped-generation households. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that coresidence with younger family members puts older adults health at risk in the context of COVID-19.

Growing populations of precarious migrants (including undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and refugees) in the UK and Europe are considered to be under-immunised groups and may be excluded from health systems, yet little is known about their views on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, which are essential to identify key solutions and action points to strengthen vaccine roll-out. Methods We did an in-depth semi-structured qualitative interview study of recently arrived migrants (foreign-born, >18 years old; <10 years in the UK) to the UK with precarious immigration status between September 2020 and March 2021, seeking their input into strategies to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine delivery and uptake. We used the Three Cs model (confidence, complacency and convenience) to explore COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, barriers and access. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach. Data collection continued until data saturation was reached, and no novel concepts were arising. The study was approved by the University of London ethics committee (REC 2020.00630). Results We approached 20 migrant support groups nationwide, recruiting 32 migrants (mean age 37.1 years; 21 [66%] female; mean time in the UK 5.6 years [SD 3.7 years]), including refugees (n = 3), asylum seekers (n = 19), undocumented migrants (n = 8) and migrants with limited leave to remain (n = 2) from 15 different countries (5 WHO regions). 23 (72%) of 32 migrants reported being hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and communicated concerns over vaccine content, side-effects, lack of accessible information in an appropriate language, lack of trust in the health system and low perceived need. Participants reported a range of barriers to accessing the COVID-19 vaccine and expressed concerns that their communities would be excluded from or de-prioritised in the roll-out. Undocumented migrants described fears over being charged and facing immigration checks if they present for a vaccine. All participants (n = 10) interviewed after recent government announcements that COVID-19 vaccines can be accessed without facing immigration checks remained unaware of this. Participants stated that convenience of access would be a key factor in their decision around whether to accept a vaccine and proposed alternative access points to primary care services (for example, walk-in centres in trusted places such as foodbanks, community centres and charities), alongside promoting registration with primary care for all, and working closely with communities to produce accessible information on COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions Precarious migrants may be hesitant about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine and face multiple and unique barriers to access, requiring simple but innovative solutions to ensure equitable access and uptake. Vaccine hesitancy and low awareness around entitlement and relevant access points could be easily addressed with clear, accessible, and tailored information campaigns, co-produced and delivered by trusted sources within marginalised migrant communities. These findings have immediate relevance to the COVID-19 vaccination initiatives in the UK and in other European and high-income countries with diverse migrant populations.","output":"Strategies and action points to ensure equitable uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations: A national qualitative interview study to explore the views of undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a need to provide protective equipment to the medical facilities whose supplies were threatened to be depleted Just like many countries in Europe, Montenegro responded to the need for medical equipment by using the advantages of 3D printers while establishing a state network of production hubs, ensuring closed connectivity, communication, and the mutual fulfilment of personal protective equipment (PPE) demands whenever and wherever required With the second wave of the pandemic, Montenegro rose to second place in the world with the number of coronavirus cases, which also led to an increasing number of infected medical staff Since fever is a frequent symptom of SA+RS-CoV2 infection, a type of innovative 3D-printed thermo-sensored medical gear has been designed and tested in hospital conditions This medical gear shaped like a bracelet, which changes color in the presence of high human body temperatures, proves to be efficient and easy to use for medical staff as well as patients","output":"Design of 3D Printing Thermo-Sensored Medical Gear in Detecting COVID-19 Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article deals with distance education, which as a teaching method had to be suddenly introduced in schools and higher education institutions as a result of the global pandemic situation The paper captures the second wave of Polands pandemic situation in relation to global circumstances and the methods of conducting distance learning used across the globe The purpose of this study was to investigate first-year students expectations about the education shift to distance learning GETAMEL, which is the adapted General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-Learning, was used in the study The study analyzed the influence of Experience, Subjective Norms, Enjoyment, Computer Anxiety, and Self-Efficacy on students expectations in the context of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic To test the research model presented during the research, The Partial Least Squares method of Structural Equation Modeling was used An online survey was created to conduct the research, which collected data from 670 Polish first-year undergraduate students The acquired data were analyzed using the SmartPLS 3 software The results of the research indicated that the most important factors that influence the feelings of students and can convince them to change from teaching in the classroom to teaching in the distance learning model are the feeling of pleasure in this form of education and a sense of self-efficacy The results of this study may be of particular interest to education practitioners, including teachers, and a starting point for further research on e-learning models, including, in particular, the understanding of students expectations regarding distance learning","output":"COVID-19 and Higher Education: First-Year Students Expectations toward Distance Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modeling and forecasting of tourism data have received attention in the past decades.

Prior research has made opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people's movements. However, when the directive was imposed, higher religiosity resulted in less adherence to shelter-in-place directives.

Most current serological evaluation of CP relies on examination of total immunoglobulin or IgG\\\\specific anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibody levels. However, IgA antibodies, which also circulate and are secreted along the respiratory mucosa, represent a relatively uncharacterized component of CP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Residual samples from patients and CP donors were assessed for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibody titers against the receptor\\\\binding domain responsible for viral entry. Symptom onset was obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Increased IgA anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibody levels correlated with clinical improvement and viral clearance in an infant with COVID\\\\19, prompting a broader examination of IgA levels among CP donors and hospitalized patients. Significant heterogeneity in IgA levels was observed among CP donors, which correlated weakly with IgG levels or the results of a commonly employed serological test. Unlike IgG and IgM, IgA levels were also more likely to be variable in hospitalized patients and this variability persisted in some patients >14 days following symptom onset. IgA levels were also less likely to be sustained than IgG levels following subsequent CP donation. CONCLUSIONS: IgA levels can be very heterogenous among CP donors and hospitalized patients and do not necessarily correlate with commonly employed testing platforms.

Previously established measures were largely limited in their ability to detect subtle cognitive declines in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, particularly due to weak psychometric properties (including practice effects and ceiling effects) and requirement of in-person visits that impacted ascertainment. RECENT FINDINGS We present novel cognitive measures that were designed to exhibit reduced practice effects and stronger correlations with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. In addition, we summarized some recent efforts in developing remote testing measures protocols that are aimed to overcome the limitations and inconvenience of in-person testing, and digital phenotyping, which analyses subtle forms of digital behaviour indicative of cognitive phenotypes. We discuss each measure's prognostic accuracy and potential utility in Alzheimer's disease research while also commenting on their limitations. We also describe our study, the Development of Novel Measures for Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Trials (NoMAD), that employed a parallel group design in which novel measures and established measures are compared in a clinical trials armature.

Even though host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections are beginning to be unravelled, effective clearance of virus will depend on both humoral and cellular immunity. Additionally, the presence of Spike (S)-glycoprotein reactive CD4+ T-cells in the majority of convalescent patients is consistent with its significant role in stimulating B and CD8+ T-cells. The search for immunodominant epitopes relies on experimental evaluation of peptides representing the epitopes from overlapping peptide libraries which can be costly and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in B- and T-cell epitope predictions by bioinformatic analysis have led to epitope identifications. Assessing which peptide epitope can induce potent neutralizing antibodies and robust T-cell responses is a prerequisite for the selection of effective epitopes to be incorporated in peptide-based vaccines. This review discusses the roles of B- and T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infections and experimental validations for the selection of B-, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes which could lead to the construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine.

These techniques have been improved upon over time for increased analytical capacity, and some have been mobilized for the rapid characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as its variants, facilitating the development of highly effective vaccines within 1 year of the initially reported outbreak.

Primarily, they do not examine the efficiency, which means they do not analyze the relationship between the involved inputs and the relevant outputs generated in the innovation system. The study aims to measure the efficiency and productivity of the European state's innovation system based on the data from the international ranking of economies' innovation. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, the changes in the efficiency and productivity of the innovation system coming from European states were measured using the DEA and Malmquist index methods, based on data from the European Innovation Scoreboard international ranking innovation in economies. The maximizing of economic benefits was assumed in its impact on employment and sales in a given state. The non-radial SBM model, Super SBM, and Malmquist index based on SBM were used for the research. 27 European states were subjected to the analysis in the period from 2012 to 2019. Findings: The research results indicate that the average level of efficiency in the surveyed period fluctuated around 70%. Higher results of efficiency were achieved more frequently by states that joined the EU after 2004. The increase in the productivity of individual states was caused most frequently by an increase in their efficiency (catch-up effect) and less frequently by shifting the efficiency frontier (frontier effect).

While most solutions have dealt with these aspects separately, their combination would greatly benefit the continuous monitoring of public spaces and help trigger effective countermeasures. This work presents milliTRACE-IR, a joint mmWave radar and infrared imaging sensing system performing unobtrusive and privacy preserving human body temperature screening and contact tracing in indoor spaces. milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mmWave radars and infrared thermal cameras. It achieves fully automated measurement of distancing and body temperature, by jointly tracking the subjects's faces in the thermal camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system. Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars. When entering a new room, a subject is re-identified among several other individuals by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final re-identification tool. Experimental results, obtained from a real implementation of milliTRACE-IR, demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in distance/trajectory estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring (max. errors of 0.5{\\\\deg}C).

Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with 'common cold' coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.","output":"Phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evaluation of infectious disease processes on radiologic images is an important and challenging task in medical image analysis.

METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour.

BASV-G displayed broad tissue and species tropism in vitro, and BASV-G-mediated membrane fusion was pH dependent. The conformational changes induced in BASV-G by acidification were fully reversible and did not lead to inactivation of the viral fusion protein. Our data combined with comparative sequence similarity analyses suggest that BASV-G shares structural and functional features with other rhabdovirus glycoproteins and falls into the group of class III viral fusion proteins. However, activation of BASV-G-driven fusion required a lower pH and higher temperatures than did VSV-G-mediated fusion. Moreover, in contrast to VSV-G, mature BASV-G in VSV pseudotypes consists of a mixture of high-mannose and complex glycans that enables it to bind to certain C-type lectins, thereby enhancing its attachment to target cells. Taken together, the results presented in this study will facilitate future investigations of BASV-G-mediated cell entry and its inhibition in the absence of an infectious cell culture assay for BASV and at lower biosafety levels.

Cross-sectional studies have been conducted to evaluate distress in healthcare practitioners (HCPs), but there is limited evidence with regards to the impact of continuing pandemic waves on levels of distress in HCPs. We previously studied psychological distress in HCPs during the start of the pandemic (period 1, when cases were infrequent and the country was in lockdown), and demonstrated that HCPs were experiencing considerable stress, despite the country reporting low caseloads at the time. In this study, we sought to utilize the same methodology to reexamine levels of distress as COVID-19 peaked in the country and HCPs began managing large numbers of COVID-19 cases (period 2). METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey utilizing a tool previously used during period 1 was completed by HCPs working in various settings. Demographic, professional and psychological factors such as distress, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion, and fear were assessed; and coping strategies also were measured. Items in the tool were assessed for reliability and validity. A multivariable regression was used to identify factors that continued to impact distress during period 2. RESULTS: Samples in both periods (n = 937, n = 876, respectively) were relatively comparable in demographic characteristics, but in period 2, a greater proportion of nurses and healthcare practitioners reported working in general hospitals. During the pandemic peak (period 2), 49.0% of HCPs reported high levels of distress (compared to 32% in period 1); anxiety and depression scores were approximately 21% higher in period 2; and 50.6% reported fatigue (compared to 34.3% in period 1). Variables significantly associated with greater distress in period 2 included experiencing burnout, experiencing sleep disturbances, being fatigued, having fatalistic fears, and having fears related to workload. Conversely, being male, reporting satisfaction at work, and using positive coping practices were associated with a significantly lower odds of being in distress.

However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. have become less of a burden regarding transmission via pork in many countries, but now game animals are becoming a concern; anisakiasis is becoming a global problem as the world develops a taste for sushi, and similarly for opisthorchiasis, which is increasingly being associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the emergence of these foodborne parasites provides an incentive for increased efforts being made toward control.

The problems caused by this rapid transition are combined with the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic, leading to numerous problems and difficulties in the teaching and learning processes. The recentness of these issues and developments requires detailed investigation as to how they affect distance learning. This study aims to investigate the role of psycho\\\\demographic variables in the motivation and attendance of higher education students in distance education within the context of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic. In this descriptive study, we collected data from 1494 Turkish university students via an online survey. Quantitative data were analysed using correlation analysis, t test, one\\\\way ANOVA, multiple linear regression analysis, and structural equation modelling. Stress, anxiety, depression and intolerance of uncertainty were correlated negatively with distance learning motivation and frequency of distance learning attendance. While students who attended distance learning only synchronously joined the courses more frequently, the motivation of those who joined the courses sometimes synchronously and sometimes asynchronously was higher. The strength of the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and distance learning motivation was significantly increased via anxiety and depression. Findings highlight the need for analysis of psycho\\\\demographic variables while designing and implementing distance education programmes. Psychological variables including stress, anxiety and depression are related to motivation and attendance during distance education. While using both synchronous and asynchronous distance learning enhances motivation, synchronous learning increases attendance.

An agile project contains planned processes as well as iterations. In global competitive areas, achieving agility in outsourcing processes enables the companies to cope with changes and dynamic issues. This paper introduces an integrated cognitive map-based intuitionistic fuzzy multiple criteria decision aid to rank agile outsourcing provider alternatives and then determine the best performing one. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are employed for dealing with uncertain and vague data along with the loss of information that may be occurred in numerical operations with fuzzy numbers. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map tool is used to weight the evaluation criteria that are interrelated with each other with causal links. The most appropriate agile outsourcing provider alternative is identified via intuitionistic fuzzy complex proportional assessment technique, which aims to obtain a solution relative to the ideal solution. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy decision aid, a case study is conducted in Turkish white goods industry. As a comparative study, a scenario analysis is provided to understand the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on agile provider evaluation/selection decision. According to the results obtained from the scenario analysis, it is worth noting that home office procedures are appropriate for maintaining agility in outsourcing processes of project management.","output":"A novel integrated intuitionistic fuzzy decision aid for agile outsourcing provider selection: a COVID-19 pandemic-based scenario analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of complications as a result of COVID-19 infection are emerging since the virus became a pandemic Although not fully understood, reports show that the COVID-19 virus has shown acute pericardial involvement resulting from this infection It can cause a wide range of manifestations from minimal effusion to large effusion with tamponade;however, there is little or no data on an indolent course of COVID-19 infection and its resulting manifestations Here we describe a patient who had minimal disease symptoms for weeks, resulting in sizeable pericardial effusion formation","output":"Subacute COVID-19 Infection Presenting as Indolent Large Pericardial Effusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the growth of addiction medicine randomized controlled trials (RCTs), scholars have begun examining participants' study experiences, highlighting facilitators and barriers to enrollment.

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale (>20 000 tests per day) standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There is so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since quarantine. Methods: Based on the suspected case data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and the daily testing data of Huo-Yan Laboratory, the impact of detection capabilities on the realization of \\"clearing\\" and \\"clearing the day\\" of supected cases was simulated by establishing a novel non-linear and competitive compartments differential model. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increase by 47% to 33 700, the corresponding cost of quarantine would be doubled, the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \\"daily settlement\\" (all newly discovered suspected cases are diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing result) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could start to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44%, and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10 500 tests was achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, \\"daily settlement\\" for all suspected cases could be achieved. Conclusions: Large-scale, standardized clinical testing platform, with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing, and immunoprotein assessment capabilities, need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost of the quarantine. Such infrastructure, for both common times and emergencies, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases.","output":"[The role of large-scale testing platform in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic: an empirical study based on a novel numerical model]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began its journey around the world.

It was declared as a global pandemic by WHO on 12th March 2020.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable infection and India due to its geographical location is vulnerable to a worst outbreak. India is suddenly increasing its hike in number of positive cases including number of healthcare professionals (HCPs) also acquired infection. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge and perception among health care workers in Delhi NCR, a vulnerable region, regarding COVID-19. Method: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey instrument to obtain responses from health care workers in Delhi NCR region. A 45-item survey instrument was developed using course materials available on WHO's website on emerging COVID-19. The survey covered health care workers socio demographic profile, awareness, information sources, and knowledge and perceptions related to COVID-19. Result: The study findings suggest that the level of knowledge was good among health care workers and overall a positive perception was found about COVID 19.

We measured IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes, demographic information, and laboratory characteristics. We found that 2.0%-8.5% of persons did not seroconvert 3-6 weeks after infection. Persons who seroconverted were older, were more likely to have concurrent conditions, and had higher levels of inflammatory markers. Non-White persons had higher antibody concentrations than those who identified as White; these concentrations did not decline during follow-up.

The aim of our study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control knowledge and attitudes of frontline health workers in four provinces of South Africa as well as explore some elements of health worker and health facility infection prevention and control practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was utilised. The study population comprised both clinical and non-clinical staff working in casualty departments, outpatient departments, and entrance points of health facilities. A structured self-administered questionnaire was developed using the World Health Organization guidance as the basis for the knowledge questions. COVID-19 protocols were observed during data collection. RESULTS: A total of 286 health workers from 47 health facilities at different levels of care participated in the survey. The mean score on the 10 knowledge items was 6.3 (SD = 1.6). Approximately two-thirds of participants (67.4%) answered six or more questions correctly while less than a quarter of all participants (24.1%) managed to score eight or more. A knowledge score of 8 or more was significantly associated with occupational category (being either a medical doctor or nurse), age (< 40 years) and level of hospital (tertiary level). Only half of participants (50.7%) felt adequately prepared to deal with patients with COVD-19 at the time of the survey. The health workers displaying attitudes that would put themselves or others at risk were in the minority. Only 55.6% of participants had received infection prevention and control training. Some participants indicated they did not have access to medical masks (11.8%) and gloves (9.9%) in their departments. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes of participants reflected a willingness to engage in appropriate SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control practices as well as a commitment to be involved in COVID-19 patient care. Ensuring adequate infection prevention and control training for all staff and universal access to appropriate PPE were identified as key areas that needed to be addressed.

Covid-19 required the urgency of a new psychological intervention model to better address the crisis and ensure a direct support response to the people involved in the pandemic. The present study aimed to detect the symptoms and reactions of the population with respect to the event. The survey was carried out by describing the clinical symptoms that emerged from the triage card used by SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna (Italy), connoting the criteria of emergency psychology. METHODS: A retrospective quantitative study was conducted on 288 psychological triage cards. RESULTS: only 11% of users who ask for support say they are positive while 85% report not having contracted the virus. Of the total, 40.9% call for psychological support in the management of anxiety symptoms, a need also reported by 55% of the subsample who declared previous psychological problems. In reaction to the pandemic event, 51.1% of the total refers to coping resources and availability for help. DISCUSSIONS: the need for support of the population to manage symptoms highlights the need for early interventions, also to facilitate that slice of the population that does not have effective individual coping strategies and resources available to help. CONCLUSIONS: it can be deduced that interventions during these types of emergencies must be timely and aimed not only at those affected but also at the general population.

One of their major tasks is to monitor infected persons. For instance, the direct contacts of infectious persons at group meetings have to be traced and potentially quarantined. Such quarantine requirements may be revoked, when all contact persons obtain a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result. However, contact tracing and testing is time-consuming, costly and not always feasible. In this work, we present a statistical model for the probability that no transmission of COVID-19 occurred given an arbitrary number of negative test results among contact persons. Hereby, the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test are taken into account. We employ a parametric Bayesian model which combines an adaptable Beta-Binomial prior and two likelihood components in a novel fashion. This is illustrated for group events in German school classes. The first evaluation on a real-world dataset showed that our approach can support important quarantine decisions with the goal to achieve a better balance between necessary containment of the pandemic and preservation of social and economic life.

Despite abundant studies on behavioral and neurobiological changes induced by post-weaning SI, the characterization of its imaging correlates, such as resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), is critically lacking. In addition, the effects of resocialization after isolation remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of 1) SI on cortical functional connectivity and 2) subsequent resocialization on behavior and functional connectivity. METHODS Behavioral tests were conducted to validate the post-weaning SI mouse model, which is isolated during the juvenile period. Wide-field optical mapping was performed to observe both neuronal and hemodynamic signals in the cortex under anesthesia. Using seed-based and graph theoretical analyses, RSFC was analyzed. The SI mice were resocialized and the array of behavior and imaging tests was conducted. RESULTS Behaviorally, SI mice showed elevated anxiety, social preference, and aggression. RSFC analyses using the seed-based approach revealed decreased cortical functional connectivity in SI mice, especially in the frontal region. Graph network analyses demonstrated significant reduction in network segregation measures. After resocialization, mice exhibited recovered anxiogenic and aggressive behavior, but the RSFC data did not show significant changes. CONCLUSIONS We observed an overall decrease in functional connectivity in SI mice. Moreover, resocialization restored the disruptions in behavioral patterns but functional connectivity was not recovered. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that, despite the recovering tendencies of behavior in resocialized mice, similar changes in RSFC were not observed.

Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.","output":"Capability, opportunity, and motivation to enact hygienic practices in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in molecular testing and microfluidic technologies have opened new avenues for rapid detection of animal viruses. We used a centrifugal microfluidic disk (CMFD) to detect 6 important swine viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory swine virus-North American genotype, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, and porcine parvovirus. Through integrating the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and microfluidic chip technology, the CMFD could be successfully performed at 62 in 60 min. The detection limit of the CMFD was 3.2  102 copies per reaction, close to the sensitivity of tube-type LAMP turbidity methods (1  102 copies per reaction). In addition, the CMFD was highly specific in detecting the targeted viruses with no cross-reaction with other viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine rotavirus. The coincidence rate of CMFD and conventional PCR was ~94%; the CMFD was more sensitive than conventional PCR for detecting mixed viral infections. The positive detection rate of 6 viruses in clinical samples by CMFD was 44.0% (102 of 232), whereas PCR was 40.1% (93 of 232). Thirty-six clinical samples were determined to be coinfected with 2 or more viruses. CMFD can be used for rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of 6 swine viruses, offering a reliable assay for monitoring these pathogens, especially for detecting viruses in widespread mixed-infection clinical samples.","output":"Multiplex detection of six swine viruses on an integrated centrifugal disk using loop-mediated isothermal amplification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antiviral drug development for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is occurring at an unprecedented pace, yet there are still limited therapeutic options for treating this disease.

Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Sixteen synergistic and eight antagonistic combinations were identified; among 16 synergistic cases, combinations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug nitazoxanide with remdesivir, amodiaquine, or umifenovir were most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell model. However, the combination of remdesivir and lysosomotropic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, demonstrated strong antagonism.

In chickens, synthetic ssRNA analog, resiquimod, has been shown to elicit antiviral response against infectious bursal disease virus infection. The objective of this study was to determine the innate host responses activated by the pre-hatch in ovo administration of resiquimod against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection in chickens post-hatch. RESULTS: First, we observed that in ovo treatment of resiquimod at embryo day (ED) 18 increases macrophage recruitment in respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues of chicken day 1 post-hatch in addition to interleukin (IL)-1 in lungs. Second, we observed that in ovo treatment of resiquimod reduces ILTV cloacal shedding at 7 days post-infection (dpi) when challenged at day 1 post-hatch coinciding with higher macrophage recruitment. In vitro, we found that resiquimod enhances production of nitric oxide (NO) and IL-1 and not type 1 interferon (IFN) activity in avian macrophages. Although, the antiviral response against ILTV is associated with the enhanced innate immune response, it is not dependent on any of the innate immune mediators observed as has been shown in vitro using avian macrophage. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the mechanisms of antiviral response mediated by resiquimod, particularly against ILTV infection in chicken.","output":"Single stranded (ss)RNA-mediated antiviral response against infectious laryngotracheitis virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Understanding the knowledge, attitude, and practices of persons with disabilities about COVID-19 are essential for taking targeted prevention and control measures. This study aimed to explore the level of knowledge, attitude, and practices related to COVID-19 in persons with disabilities and identify obstacles and facilitators of promoting their knowledge, attitude, and practices. Instrument & Methods A mixed qualitative-quantitative study was conducted on 1067 Persons with disabilities in Iran in 2020. The researchers collected descriptive data using an online researcher-made questionnaire that included demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practices sections which its participants were selected randomly from all Persons with disabilities in Iran.

Our objective was to systematically review the studies reporting the time of onset of selected skin lesions with respect to the reported onset of the COVID-19 core symptoms. METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published before 21 January 2021 was performed on MEDLINE via PubMed database using a predefined strategy to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Out of 354 references, 87 were selected, reporting a total of 895 patients with skin lesions associated with COVID-19. The most frequent pattern was exanthema (n = 430, 48%), followed by vascular (n = 299, 33%), urticarial (n = 105, 12%) and others (n = 66, 7%). Skin lesions occurred more frequently in the first 4 weeks from the COVID-19 onset (n = 831, 92%), whereas prodromal or late lesions were rarer (n = 69, 8%). The urticarial and exanthema patterns were more frequent in the first 2 weeks. About the vascular pattern some differences were noted among its subtypes. Livedoid lesions occurred mainly in the first 2 weeks, while chilblain-like lesions between weeks 2 and 4. Purpuric/petechial lesions were equally distributed during the first 4 weeks. Several skin manifestations did not fall into the pattern classification, including erythema multiforme, generalized pruritus, Kawasaki disease and others.

For this, serum or plasma samples (n = 146) collected from 79 COVID-19 patients were used. Indirect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific IgA, IgG, and IgG subtype specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed. Antibody titers between severe and nonsevere patients were compared at different times postonset of clinical symptoms. Titers in ELISA were compared to neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Over 75% patients were positive for IgA/IgG antibodies in the first week. The ELISA titers did not differ during the first week; however, severe disease exhibited raised titers thereafter. Nab titers correlated with the ELISA titers in mild presentation but not in severe disease. IgA and IgG1 antibodies correlated stronger with Nabs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of stress on nurses burnout and to identify the mediating effects of secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction among clinical nurses in South Korea. METHODS: A quantitative, cross-sectional study evaluated the survey data from 10,305 female registered hospital nurses who participated in the Korea Nurses Health Study (KNHS) Module 5. The survey included a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life version 5 (ProQOL 5). Bootstrap analyses (using the PROCESS macro) were employed to evaluate the mediating effect between variables. RESULTS: Stress was significantly associated with burnout and mediated by secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction ((indirect 1) = 0.185, Bootstrap confidence interval (BS CI) [0.175, 0.194]; (indirect 2) = 0.226, BS CI [0.212, 0.241], respectively). In addition, the magnitude of the indirect effects of compassion satisfaction was significantly greater than the magnitude of the indirect effects of secondary traumatic stress ((indirect 1)-(indirect 2) = ? 0.042, BS CI [? 0.058, ? 0.026]). The findings of this study indicate that the positive aspect (compassion satisfaction) of work experiences can offset the negative aspects (secondary traumatic stress), consequently reducing burnout level.

Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.","output":"Structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles degrades with temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research was to assess the psychological effects of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on mental health nurses.

METHODS: To achieve the study objectives, we analyzed the publics information-seeking behaviors on Google and news media coverage on COVID-19. We collected data on COVID-19 news coverage and Google search queries from eight countries (ie, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) between January 1 and April 29, 2020. We depicted the characteristics of the COVID-19 news coverage trends over time, as well as the search query trends for the topics of COVID-19Crelated diseases, treatments and medical resources, symptoms and signs, and public measures. The search query trends provided the relative search volume (RSV) as an indicator to represent the popularity of a specific search term in a specific geographic area over time. Also, time-lag correlation analysis was used to further explore the relationship between search terms trends and the number of new daily cases, as well as the relationship between search terms trends and news coverage. RESULTS: Across all search trends in eight countries, almost all search peaks appeared between March and April 2020, and declined in April 2020. Regarding COVID-19Crelated diseases, in most countries, the RSV of the term coronavirus increased earlier than that of covid-19; however, around April 2020, the search volume of the term covid-19 surpassed that of coronavirus. Regarding the topic treatments and medical resources, the most and least searched terms were mask and ventilator, respectively. Regarding the topic symptoms and signs, fever and cough were the most searched terms. The RSV for the term lockdown was significantly higher than that for social distancing under the topic public health measures. In addition, when combining search trends with news coverage, there were three main patterns: (1) the pattern for Singapore, (2) the pattern for the United States, and (3) the pattern for the other countries. In the time-lag correlation analysis between the RSV for the topic treatments and medical resources and the number of new daily cases, the RSV for all countries except Singapore was positively correlated with new daily cases, with a maximum correlation of 0.8 for the United States. In addition, in the time-lag correlation analysis between the overall RSV for the topic diseases and the number of daily news items, the overall RSV was positively correlated with the number of daily news items, the maximum correlation coefficient was more than 0.8, and the search behavior occurred 0 to 17 days earlier than the news coverage.

Diagnostic criteria for ON are lacking and the psychopathology of ON is still a matter of debate in the clinical and scientific community. Our aim was to better understand the Italian clinical and scientific communitys opinion about ON. METHODS: Anonymous online survey for Italian healthcare professionals, implemented with the REDCap platform and spread through a multicenter collaboration. Information was gathered about socio-demographic, educational and occupational features, as well as about experience in the diagnosis and treatment of EDs. The main part of the survey focused on ON and its features, classification and sociocultural correlates. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 343 participants. Most responders (68.2%) considered ON as a variant of Eating Disorders (EDs), and 58.6% a possible prodromal phase or evolution of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Most participants (68.5%) thought the next DSM should include a specific diagnostic category for ON, preferably in the EDs macro-category (82.1%). Moreover, 77.3% of responders thought that ON deserves more attention on behalf of researchers and clinicians, and that its treatment should be similar to that for EDs (60.9%). Participants thinking that ON should have its own diagnostic category in the next DSM edition had greater odds of being younger (p = 0.004) and of considering ON a prodromic phase of another ED, such as AN (p = 0.039). DISCUSSION: Our survey suggests that the scientific community still seems split between those who consider ON as a separate disorder and those who do not. More research is still needed to better understand the construct of ON and its relationship with EDs; disadvantages and advantages of giving ON its own diagnosis should be balanced.

However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems, and no empirical study has tested the mechanisms between them. METHODS: We conducted a survey in 31 provinces of China during 3C13 March 2020 to test the effect of the exposure level on mental health problems. Our sample comprised 2987 participants who reported their perceived threat, coping efficacy, mental health problems and other demographic variables. Multiple mediators path analysis was used in the data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the level of exposure to COVID-19 in China was negatively associated with mental health problems, which confirmed the Psychological Typhoon Eye effect. Further analyses indicated that both perceived threat and coping efficacy partially mediated the relationship between them. However, coping efficacy explained the Psychological Typhoon Eye effect. Perceived threat mediated the positive relationship between exposure level and mental health problems. CONCLUSION: This study detected the psychological typhoon eye effect and demonstrated the mediating role of coping efficacy and perceived threat between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems. Our findings suggest that policy makers and psychological workers should provide enough psychological services to low-risk areas as the high-risk areas. An important means of alleviating mental health problems is to improve coping efficacy.","output":"The psychological typhoon eye effect during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: the role of coping efficacy and perceived threat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest an article by Karanasos et al. titled \\"Impact of smoking status on disease severity and mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis\\".1 It is inferred that there is an adverse impact of smoking on disease severity and mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which is more pronounced in younger patients without diabetes.

Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S. health care system. CDC* and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)? recommended that health care systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in health care settings. By May 2020, national syndromic surveillance data found that emergency department (ED) visits had declined 42% during the early months of the pandemic (1). This report describes trends in ED visits for three acute life-threatening health conditions (myocardial infarction [MI, also known as heart attack], stroke, and hyperglycemic crisis), immediately before and after declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. These conditions represent acute events that always necessitate immediate emergency care, even during a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 10 weeks following the emergency declaration (March 15-May 23, 2020), ED visits declined 23% for MI, 20% for stroke, and 10% for hyperglycemic crisis, compared with the preceding 10-week period (January 5-March 14, 2020). EDs play a critical role in diagnosing and treating life-threatening conditions that might result in serious disability or death. Persons experiencing signs or symptoms of serious illness, such as severe chest pain, sudden or partial loss of motor function, altered mental state, signs of extreme hyperglycemia, or other life-threatening issues, should seek immediate emergency care, regardless of the pandemic. Clear, frequent, highly visible communication from public health and health care professionals is needed to reinforce the importance of timely care for medical emergencies and to assure the public that EDs are implementing infection prevention and control guidelines that help ensure the safety of their patients and health care personnel.","output":"Potential Indirect Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Use of Emergency Departments for Acute Life-Threatening Conditions - United States, January-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PET/CT imaging is the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. However, especially in healthcare systems with limited resources, costly PET/CT images are often not readily available. Conventional machine learning models either process CT or PET/CT images but not both. Models designed for PET/CT images are hence restricted by the number of PET images, such that they are unable to additionally leverage CT-only data. In this work, we apply the concept of visual soft attention to efficiently learn a model for lung cancer segmentation from only a small fraction of PET/CT scans and a larger pool of CT-only scans. We show that our model is capable of jointly processing PET/CT as well as CT-only images, which performs on par with the respective baselines whether or not PET images are available at test time. We then demonstrate that the model learns efficiently from only a few PET/CT scans in a setting where mostly CT-only data is available, unlike conventional models.

Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown.

Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID 19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians. Methods In this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID 19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID 19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions. Findings Younger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5,58, 95% CI 4,97-6,25; p < 0,0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21,09, 13,64-32,6; p < 0,0001) and obesity (aOR 21,7, 95% CI not calculated; p < 0,0001), resulted in outstanding death risk. Age over 60, particularly over 90 (28,91, 24,5-34,11; p < 0,001), usage of invasive ventilatory support (16,23, 14,05-18,75; p < 0,001), admission to intensive care units (3,14, 2,82-3,48; p < 0,001), multiple respiratory symptoms (3,24, 2,79-3,75; p < 0,0001), black ethnicity (1,78, 1,52-2,07; p < 0,05), and diagnosis previous to hospitalization (1,32, 1,19-1,47; p < 0,05) were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, with roughly one third less death risk, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days. Interpretation We found evidence for increased COVID 19 risk in two distinct groups: younger patients with prevalent comorbidities, especially in brown ethnicity, and patients with black ethnicity. We speculate that the pro-inflammatory synergism of COVID 19 and comorbidities, promoting an overproduction of cytokines, is partially the cause of higher mortality in this young group. Brazilian black and brown are underprivileged populations, with structural social inequality, limited healthcare access and, thus, remarkable disease vulnerability. Our study supplies essential data to patient stratification upon admission, optimizing hospital management, and to guide public policy determinations, including group prioritization for COVID 19 vaccination in Brazil.","output":"Prevalent comorbidities among young and underprivileged: Death portrait of COVID-19 among 235 555 hospitalized patients in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ten lines of transgenic mice secreting transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) neutralizing recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rMAbs) into the milk were generated. The rMAb light- and heavy-chain genes were assembled by fusing the genes encoding the variable modules of the murine MAb 6A.C3, which binds an interspecies conserved coronavirus epitope essential for virus infectivity, and a constant module from a porcine myeloma with the immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype. The chimeric antibody led to dimer formation in the presence of J chain. The neutralization specific activity of the recombinant antibody produced in transiently or stably transformed cells was 50-fold higher than that of a monomeric rMAb with the IgG1 isotype and an identical binding site. This rMAb had titers of up to 10(4) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and neutralized virus infectivity up to 10(4)-fold. Of 23 transgenic mice, 17 integrated both light and heavy chains, and at least 10 of them transmitted both genes to the progeny, leading to 100% of animals secreting functional TGEV neutralizing antibody during lactation. Selected mice produced milk with TGEV-specific antibody titers higher than 10(6) as determined by RIA, neutralized virus infectivity by 10(6)-fold, and produced up to 6 mg of antibody per ml. Antibody expression levels were transgene copy number independent and integration site dependent. Comicroinjection of the genomic beta-lactoglobulin gene with rMAb light- and heavy-chain genes led to the generation of transgenic mice carrying the three transgenes. The highest antibody titers were produced by transgenic mice that had integrated the antibody and beta-lactoglobulin genes, although the number of transgenic animals generated does not allow a definitive conclusion on the enhancing effect of beta-lactoglobulin cointegration. This approach may lead to the generation of transgenic animals providing lactogenic immunity to their progeny against enteric pathogens.","output":"Transgenic mice secreting coronavirus neutralizing antibodies into the milk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study evaluates the performance of the antigen-based anterior nasal screening programme implemented in all Austrian schools to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections.

In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation.

This paper constructs a time delay reaction-diffusion model that is closer to the actual spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including relapse, time delay, home quarantine and temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment that affect the spread of COVID-19. These factors increase the number of equations and the coupling between equations in the system, making it difficult to apply the methods commonly used to discuss global dynamics, such as the Lyapunov function method. Therefore, we use the global exponential attractor theory in the infinite-dimensional dynamic system to study the spreading trend of the COVID-9 epidemic with relapse, time delay, home quarantine in a temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment. Using our latest results of global exponential attractor theory, the global asymptotic stability and the persistence of the COVID-19 epidemic are discussed. We find that due to the influence of relapse in the in temporal-spatial heterogeneity environment, the principal eigenvalue [Formula: see text] can describe the spread of the epidemic more accurately than the usual basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. That is, the non-constant disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] and the COVID-19 epidemic is persisting uniformly when [Formula: see text]. Combine with the latest official data of the COVID-19 and the prevention and control strategies of different countries, some numerical simulations on the stability and global exponential attractiveness of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and the USA are given. The simulation results fully reflect the impact of the temporal-spatial heterogeneous environment, relapse, time delay and home quarantine strategies on the spread of the epidemic, revealing the significant differences in epidemic prevention strategies and control effects between the East and the West. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the current epidemic prevention and control.","output":"Dynamic analysis of a delayed COVID-19 epidemic with home quarantine in temporal-spatial heterogeneous via global exponential attractor method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. RESULT: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score  8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0C7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2C0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0C2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6C3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3C3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3C8.5). CONCLUSION: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","output":"Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The entire world is currently facing a devastating crisis due to growing coronavirus pandemic, which was declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 Management of cancer patients at this time is an overwhelming task This study highlights our experience in the management of patients of gynecological malignancies over a period of 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: Patients of confirmed gynecological malignancies who visited our outpatient clinic and those who received radiotherapy/chemotherapy in March and April 2020 were included for analysis Guidelines issued by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, National Health Service, MD Anderson Cancer Centre and those by young oncologists in Italy were followed with minor modifications while managing the logistics and health worker safety Results: A total of 160 patients were treated in our department during this time period In total, 44 4% of patients on treatment had associated comorbidities that imposed an additional risk One hundred twenty-three patients continued treatment with their initial plan of radiotherapy or chemotherapy New patients were prioritized based on the severity of clinical symptoms and whether the expected outcome would significantly affect their survival and quality of life Patients were monitored for the development of treatment-related toxicities and COVID-19-related symptoms Conclusions: All oncology personnel need to identify the correct balance between risks and benefit and then proceed with further management Thus, it is essential to cautiously select patients for treatment, minimizing the risk of exposure but adequately addressing the underlying disease","output":"Rationalizing Treatment for Gynecological Cancers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life-changing progress has been made over the past 30 years in the treatment of HIV infection.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the impact on contamination characteristics before and after the second partial lockdown in France to adapt public health restrictions to further prevent pandemic surges. METHODS: Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020. RESULTS: As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues.

Our objective was to determine whether suicide mortality rates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series study using data from January 2019 through December 2020 from 2 large integrated health care systems. The population at risk included all patients or individuals enrolled in a health plan at HealthPartners in Minnesota or Henry Ford Health System in Michigan. The primary outcome was change in suicide mortality rates, expressed as annualized crude rates of suicide death per 100,000 people in 10 months following the start of the pandemic in March 2020 compared with the 14 months prior. RESULTS: There were 6,434,675 people at risk in the sample, with 55% women and a diverse sample across ages, race/ethnicity, and insurance type. From January 2019 through February 2020, there was a slow increase in the suicide mortality rate, with rates then decreasing by 0.45 per 100,000 people per month from March 2020 through December 2020 (SE=0.19, P=0.03).

METHODS: The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively.

We report the effect of intravenous alteplase on long-term survival after ischaemic stroke of participants in the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). METHODS In IST-3, done at 156 hospitals in 12 countries (Australia, Europe, and the UK), participants (aged >18 years) were randomly assigned with a telephone voice-activated or web-based system in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with intravenous 09 mg/kg alteplase plus standard care or standard care alone within 6 h of ischaemic stroke. We followed up participants in the UK and Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway) for survival up to 3 years after randomisation using data from national registries and compared survival in the two groups with proportional hazards survival analysis, adjusting for key prognostic variables. IST-3 is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN25765518. FINDINGS Between May 5, 2000, and July 27, 2011, 3035 participants were enrolled in IST-3. Of these, 1948 (64%) of 3035 participants were scheduled for analysis of 3 year survival, and 1946 (>99%) of these were included in the analysis (967 [50%] in the alteplase plus standard care group and 979 [50%] in the standard care alone group). By 3 years after randomisation, 453 (47%) of 967 participants in the alteplase plus standard care group and 494 (50%) of 979 in the standard care alone group had died (risk difference 36% [95% CI -08 to 81]). Participants allocated to alteplase had a significantly higher hazard of death during the first 7 days (99 [10%] of 967 died in the alteplase plus standard care group vs 65 [7%] of 979 in the standard care alone group; hazard ratio 152 [95% CI 111-208]; p=0004) and a significantly lower hazard of death between 8 days and 3 years (354 [41%] of 868 vs 429 [47%] of 914; 078 [068-090]; p=0007). INTERPRETATION Alteplase treatment within 6 h after ischaemic stroke was associated with a small, non-significant reduction in risk of death at 3 years, but among individuals who survived the acute phase, treatment was associated with a significant increase in long-term survival. These results are reassuring for clinicians who have expressed concerns about the effect of alteplase on survival.

Structural characterization of P2G3 Fab in complex with the Omicron Spike demonstrates unique binding properties to both down and up spike trimer conformations at an epitope that partially overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD), yet is distinct from those bound by all other characterized mAbs. This distinct epitope and angle of attack allows P2G3 to overcome all the Omicron mutations abolishing or impairing neutralization by other anti-SARS-COV-2 mAbs, and P2G3 accordingly confers complete prophylactic protection in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron monkey challenge model. Finally, although we could isolate in vitro SARS-CoV2 mutants escaping neutralization by P2G3 or by P5C3, a previously described broadly active Class 1 mAb, we found these viruses to be lowly infectious and their key mutations extremely rare in the wild, and we could demonstrate that P2G3/P5C3 efficiently cross-neutralized one anothers escapees.

TNBC is associated with a dismal prognosis and an insufficient response to chemotherapies. Previously, menin was shown to play a proliferative role in ER-positive breast cancer; however, the functions of menin in TNBC remain unknown.

Super-resolution (SR), in the past few years, has produced remarkable results using deep learning methods. The ability of deep learning methods to learn the non-linear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to their corresponding high-resolution (HR) images leads to compelling results for SR in diverse areas of research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based image super-resolution architecture in Tchebichef transform domain. This is achieved by integrating a transform layer into the proposed architecture through a customized Tchebichef convolutional layer ($TCL$). The role of TCL is to convert the LR image from the spatial domain to the orthogonal transform domain using Tchebichef basis functions. The inversion of the aforementioned transformation is achieved using another layer known as the Inverse Tchebichef convolutional Layer (ITCL), which converts back the LR images from the transform domain to the spatial domain. It has been observed that using the Tchebichef transform domain for the task of SR takes the advantage of high and low-frequency representation of images that makes the task of super-resolution simplified. We, further, introduce transfer learning approach to enhance the quality of Covid based medical images. It is shown that our architecture enhances the quality of X-ray and CT images of COVID-19, providing a better image quality that helps in clinical diagnosis.

RESULTS: As compared with the background aerosol concentrations, coblation and electrocautery showed statistically significant increases in airborne aerosols (Tukey-adjusted P value <.040), while microdebrider and drilling at 30,000 rpm did not (.870 < Tukey-adjusted P value < .930). We identified viral DNA in samples from coblation and drilling procedures, although we did not identify viable viruses in aerosol samples from any of the 4 procedures. CONCLUSION: Coblation and electrocautery procedures generate >100-fold increases in aerosol concentrations over background; only coblation and drilling produce aerosolized viral DNA. The high concentration of aerosols from coblation and electrocautery suggests the need for appropriate safeguards against particle exposure to health care workers. The presence of viral DNA from drilling and coblation procedures warrants the need for appropriate protection against droplet and aerosol exposure.","output":"Airborne Aerosolized Mouse Cytomegalovirus From Common Otolaryngology Procedures: Implications for COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate student, parent/carer and secondary school staff attitudes towards school COVID-19 mitigation measures Methods Recruitment used school communication, community organisations and snowball sampling in South West England Audio recorded online or phone individual/group semi-structured interviews were conducted in July-Septtember 2020 and lasted 30-60 min Interviews focused on views towards social distancing, hand hygiene and testing Framework analysis was performed on interview notes/transcripts Results Participants were 15 staff, 20 parents and 17 students (11-16 years) from 14 diverse schools Concerns about COVID-19 risk at school, especially to vulnerable individuals, were outweighed by perceived risks of missed learning Some staff felt guilt around being a potential a  spreader' by teaching multiple classes Findings highlighted a wide variety of school COVID-19 mitigation measures being deployed due to ambiguous government guidance Participants generally saw mitigation measures as an acceptable and pragmatic solution to the perceived impossibility of social distancing in crowded schools, although anticipated challenges changing habitual behaviour Participants supported school COVID-19 testing but identified the need to consider data security and stigma around COVID-19 diagnosis Staff were concerned about unintended consequences of risk-reduction strategies on student behaviour, learning and pastoral care, particularly for those with Special Educational Needs or mental health issues who may find the measures especially challenging, and resultant widening inequalities Conclusion Families and staff supported COVID-19 mitigation measures in schools and would welcome the roll out school COVID-19 testing Clear messaging and engendering collective responsibility are important for compliance and success of COVID-19 mitigation measures However, schools and policy-makers should consider unintended consequences of measures, providing extra support for vulnerable students and those with additional needs, and consider ways to avoid widening educational and health inequalities Findings demonstrate the acceptability of school COVID-19 infection control measures is likely to be influenced by the balance of risks and benefits to students ?

We evaluate the influence of timing between ADT and RT on outcomes in patients with HR-PC using a large national cancer database. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data for patients with clinical T1-T4 N0, M0, National Cancer Comprehensive Network HR-PC who were treated with definitive external RT (60 Gy) and ADT starting either before or within 14 days after RT start were extracted from the National Cancer Database (2004-2015). Patients were grouped on the basis of ADT initiation: (1) >11 weeks before RT, (2) 8 to 11weeks before RT, and (3) <8 weeks before RT. Kaplan-Meier, propensity score matching, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards were performed to evaluate overall survival (OS). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 68.9 months, 37,606 patients with HR-PC were eligible for analysis: 13,346 (35.5%) with >11 weeks of neoadjuvant ADT, 11,456 (30.5%) with 8 to 11 weeks of neoadjuvant ADT; and 12,804 (34%) patients with <8 weeks of neoadjuvant ADT. The unadjusted 10-year OS rates for >11 weeks, 8 to 11 weeks, and <8 weeks neoadjuvant ADT groups were 49.9%, 51.2%, and 46.9%, respectively (P = .002). On multivariable and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses, there was a significant OS advantage for patients in the 8 to 11 weeks neoadjuvant ADT group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.95; P < .001) but not the >11 weeks group. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant ADT initiation 8 to 11 weeks before RT is associated with significantly improved OS compared with shorter neoadjuvant ADT duration. Although prospective validation is warranted, this analysis is the largest retrospective study suggesting an influence of timing between ADT and RT initiation in HR-PC.","output":"Influence of Timing Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and External Beam Radiation Therapy in Patients With Localized, High-Risk Prostate Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE SUMMARY: Herein we describe an unusual metastatic pattern and paraneoplastic manifestation of a bronchial carcinoma in a cat.

To combat COVID-19, researcher communities continuously develop and implement rapid diagnoses, safe and effective vaccinations and other alternative therapeutic procedures. However, synthetic drug-related side effects and high costs have piqued scientists interest in natural product-based therapies and medicines. In this regard, antiviral substances derived from natural resources and some medicines have seen a boom in popularity. For instance, algae are a rich source of compounds such as lectins and sulfated polysaccharides, which have potent antiviral and immunity-boosting properties. Moreover, Algae-derived compounds or metabolites can be used as antibodies and vaccine raw materials against COVID-19. Furthermore, some algal species can boost immunity, reduce viral activity in humans and be recommended for usage as a COVID-19 preventative measure.

In the United States, there have been 8.3 million cases and nearly 222,000 deaths as of October 21, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath of this pandemic. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the United States during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected from English-speaking adults from early April to early June 2020 using an online survey. The final convenience sample included 1083 US residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and well-being measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19Cspecific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19Cspecific concerns, and mental health and well-being outcomes. RESULTS: Approximately 50% (536/1076) of the US sample was aged 45 years. Most of the sample was White (1013/1054, 96%), non-Hispanic (985/1058, 93%), and female (884/1073, 82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (295/1034, 29%), anxiety (342/1007, 34%), and stress (773/1058, 73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR 0.78, P<.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR 0.72, P<.001); in addition, they had lower stress scores (C0.15 points, SE 0.01, P<.001) and increased well-being scores (1.86 points, SE 0.22, P<.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a 0.51-point increase in stress (SE 0.17, P=.02), and a 3.9-point decrease in well-being scores (SE 1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID-19. Individuals who had partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid and individuals with no coverage were 1.97 and 4.48 times more likely to report moderate or severe anxiety, respectively (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P<.05), and significantly negatively related to well-being (both P<.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially those who are underinsured, uninsured, or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.","output":"Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess the psychological status of college students in China during the COVID-19 outbreak, and offer some theoretical evidence for psychological intervention of college students.

The therapy proved ineffective with long QT and deadly cardiac arrhythmia risks, illustrating challenges to determine the new safety profile of repurposed drugs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate proarrhythmic effects and mechanism of HCQ and AZM (combined and alone) with high doses of HCQ as in the COVID-19 clinical trials. METHODS: Proarrhythmic effects of HCQ and AZM are quantified using optical mapping with voltage-sensitive dyes in ex vivo Langendorff-perfused guinea pig (GP) hearts and with numerical simulations of a GP Luo-Rudy and a human OHara-Virag-Varro-Rudy models, for Epi, Endo, and M cells, in cell and tissue, incorporating the drugs effect on cell membrane ionic currents. RESULTS: Experimentally, HCQ alone and combined with AZM leads to long QT intervals by prolonging the action potential duration and increased spatial dispersion of action potential (AP) repolarization across the heart, leading to proarrhythmic discordant alternans. AZM alone had a lesser arrhythmic effect with less triangulation of the AP shape. Mathematical cardiac models fail to reproduce most of the arrhythmic effects observed experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: During public health crises, the risks and benefits of new and repurposed drugs could be better assessed with alternative experimental and computational approaches to identify proarrhythmic mechanisms. Optical mapping is an effective framework suitable to investigate the drugs adverse effects on cardiac cell membrane ionic channels at the cellular level and arrhythmia mechanisms at the tissue and whole-organ level.","output":"Quantifying arrhythmic long QT effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with whole-heart optical mapping and simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 menstimulus tatanan dunia baru dan percepatan revolusi Industri 4.0.

It started in December 2019 and has, so far, led to more than 149, 470,968 cases, 3,152,121 deaths, and 127,133,013 survivors recovered by 28 April 2021. COVID-19 has a high morbidity, and mortality of 2%, on average, whereas most people are treated after a period of time. Some people who recover from COVID-19 are left with 20 to 30% decreased lung function. In this context, exercise focused on skeletal muscle with minimal lung involvement could potentially play an important role. Regular exercise protects against diseases associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. This long-term effect of exercise may be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory response elicited by an acute bout of exercise, which is partly mediated by muscle-derived myokines. The isometric training system seems to have this feature, because this system is involved with the skeletal muscle as the target tissue.

STUDY DESIGN The clinical data of 2,056 patients (2,473 hernias) who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center between January 2001 and December 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The operation priority was used to divide the patients into 7 groups for analysis of the learning curve. RESULTS There were 1,005 transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repairs (TAPP), 1,458 total extraperitoneal repairs (TEP), and 10 intraperitoneal onlay mesh repairs performed on 874, 1,175, and 7 patients, respectively. Median follow-up period was 60 months. The operation time and postoperative hospital stay for TEP were considerably shorter than those for TAPP. The complication rate for TEP, especially seroma, was considerably lower. Transabdominal preperitoneal patch plastic repair was performed in 81.4% of the recurrent inguinal hernias. Seven patients underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and 3 others underwent unilateral intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair and TAPP on the opposite. Most of patients with grade I and II hernias underwent TEP. The learning curve has demonstrated that more obstacles occurred in the earlier phase of the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair training, supported by findings such as fewer cases performed annually, longer operation time, and higher incidence of complications and recurrence. These findings have improved as experience is accumulated through more operations. In addition, the ratios of TEP to TAPP and mesh nonfixation to fixation also evolved throughout the course of the study.

Peer reviewed data is sparse comparing glycemic control and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with vs. without DM2, and thus we sought to address this gap. Methods: We selected patients at least 18 years old who expired or were discharged between March 16, 2020 through September 15, 2020. Principal analysis compared glycemic patterns among patients with DM2 vs. non-DM2. Median, coefficient of variation (CV), maximum and minimum glucose parameters were computed to characterize longitudinal glycemic patterns. Logistic regression modeling identified significant (p&amp;lt;.05) associations between composite outcome vs. glycemic parameters and putative risks for progression to severe COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified cut points for glycemic parameters. Cox regression models were employed to control for significant confounders. Continuous data summarized as median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Discrete data were compared with Pearsons chi-square test. Two-tailed p&amp;lt;.05 was significant.

Stents placed across the transverse and sigmoid sinuses often cover the vein of Labb (VOL), a major anastomotic vein draining the cerebral hemisphere. The patency of the VOL after stenting and its clinical implications are poorly understood. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing venous sinus stenting. Pre- and post-stent angiography were compared to assess changes in VOL patency, clinical and radiographic outcomes. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 56 patients. The stent covered the VOL in 92.9% of cases. Thirty-two cases with VOL coverage had evaluable angiograms immediately after stent placement. Among these, VOL filled normally in 75.0%, exhibited diminished caliber with normal transit time in 3.1%, filled sluggishly in 18.8%, and was occluded in 3.1%. Follow-up was assessed in patients with at least 3 months' angiographic follow-up (46 patients, mean 7.2 months). Of these, normal filling was seen in 71.7%, diminished caliber in 26.1%, and sluggish filling in 2.2% of cases. Neither stent coverage of the VOL nor its patency immediately after stenting or at follow-up correlated with stent-adjacent stenosis. There were no neurological sequelae from coverage of the VOL or alteration of its drainage pattern. CONCLUSIONS In the majority of venous stenting cases involving the transverse and sigmoid sinuses, the VOL remains widely patent. Complete VOL occlusion rarely occurs after stenting and may not result in clinical sequelae.

School of Dental Medicine (UNLV SDM) recently acquired 36 Von Hagens plastinated head and neck specimens to be used in the first semester ?Head and Neck Anatomy and Neuroscience? course. The 2020-entry class was the first cohort of students to supplement their digital-based anatomy curriculum with human specimens. From a student perspective, there was trepidation regarding the change and workload addition as previous cohorts did not use this educational approach yet successfully passed their board exams, were accepted into residency programs and found quality employment. Positive reports did document that the ability to conceptualize the three-dimensional anatomy was greatly enhanced. Previous cohorts informally reported that this addition would have enhanced their learning and retention. From a faculty perspective, considerations related to COVID social-distancing requirements, lecture hall availability and encouraging student preparedness were clear challenges. A regular frustration arose as plastination hinders an instructor's ability to follow structures and reflect more muscle or bone to demonstrate deeper anatomy. UNLV SDM is awaiting re-accreditation, which was delayed due to COVID, prior to executing a curriculum reorganization. Currently, first year students have a 26-credit semester with heavy workload, even in the smaller, modular courses. This creates major constraints on the students? ability to master the content for assessments and retain the content for the NBDE board exam and clinical practice. Instructors modified structures lists, lecture topics for discussion and lab expectation continually throughout the semester to help students make the experience as meaningful as possible. This is a unique curricular reorganization as the contact hours for anatomy remain the same but the workload increases;many graduate-level health profession programs are decreasing workload and contact hours in anatomy.","output":"Utilizing Plastinated Head and Neck Dissections for Doctorate of Dental Medicine (DMD) Anatomy Laboratories in a Curriculum Approaching Reorganization: The Guinea Pig Cohort's Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To fight against COVID-19, many policymakers are wavering on stricter public health interventions. Examining the different strategies both in and out of Chinas Hubei province, which contained the epidemic in late February 2020, could yield valuable guidance for the management of future pandemics. This study assessed the response process and estimated the time-varying effects of the Hubei control strategy. Analysis of these strategies provides insights for the design and implementation of future policy interventions. METHODS: We retrospectively compared the spread and control of COVID-19 between Chinas Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and non-Hubei areas using data that includes case reports, human mobility, and public health interventions from 1 January to 29 February 2020. Static and dynamic risk assessment models were developed to statistically investigate the effects of the Hubei control strategy on the virus case growth after adjusting importation risk and policy response timing with the non-Hubei strategy as a control. RESULTS: The analysis detected much higher but differential importation risk in Hubei. The response timing largely coincided with the importation risk in non-Hubei areas, but Hubei areas showed an opposite pattern. Rather than a specific intervention assessment, a comprehensive comparison showed that the Hubei control strategy implemented severe interventions characterized by unprecedentedly strict and monitored self-quarantine at home, while the non-Hubei strategy included physical distancing measures to reduce contact among individuals within or between populations. In contrast with the non-Hubei control strategy, the Hubei strategy showed a much higher, non-linear and gradually diminishing protective effect with at least 3 times fewer cases. CONCLUSIONS: A risk-based control strategy was crucial to the design of an effective response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our study demonstrates that the stricter Hubei strategy achieves a stronger controlling effect compared to other strategies. These findings highlight the health benefits and policy impacts of precise and differentiated strategies informed by constant monitoring of outbreak risk.

Prescribed IVTM play an essential role in the treatment of illness, management of chronic conditions and in maintaining health and wellbeing. The intravenous (IV) route is the administration of concentrated medications (diluted or undiluted) directly into peripherally or centrally inserted vascular access devices. Medication safety is a key priority and best practice standards are required to guide the safe preparation and administration of IVTM. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines. Our search will include studies concerned with the preparation and/or administration of IVTM via peripheral or central vascular access devices. We will be guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in this review. Literature will include all trial designs, national/international guidelines, and expert consensus opinion made available in English from 2009 to present day. Conclusions: We will synthesise the evidence concerning safe and effective preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines to inform the development of a national guideline for healthcare professionals in Ireland. The availability of up-to-date, contemporaneous evidence-based practice standards will ensure quality and safety for service-users.

In many applications, however, data are inherently fragmented. Such a decentralized nature of these databases presents the biggest challenge for collaboration: sending all decentralized datasets to a central server raises serious privacy concerns. Although there has been a joint effort in tackling such a critical issue by proposing privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks, such as federated learning, most state-of-the-art frameworks are built still in a centralized way, in which a central client is needed for collecting and distributing model information (instead of data itself) from every other client, leading to high communication pressure and high vulnerability when there exists a failure at or attack on the central client. Here we propose a principled decentralized federated learning algorithm (DeceFL), which does not require a central client and relies only on local information transmission between clients and their neighbors, representing a fully decentralized learning framework. It has been further proven that every client reaches the global minimum with zero performance gap and achieves the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ (where $T$ is the number of iterations in gradient descent) as centralized federated learning when the loss function is smooth and strongly convex. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been applied to a number of applications to illustrate its effectiveness for both convex and nonconvex loss functions, demonstrating its applicability to a wide range of real-world medical and industrial applications.","output":"DeceFL: A Principled Decentralized Federated Learning Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created an unprecedented public health emergency.

Moreover, a pandemic is a situation that requires strong government interventions, and we further examined whether employees' trust in the government would play a moderating role in explaining the effects of commitment HRM. With a multilevel framework, we measured commitment HRM via an analysis of big data provided online prior to the pandemic and matched the information to employees' responses collected from a survey after the outbreak of the pandemic. With data from 1010 employees and 52 companies, we found that employees in organizations with a higher utilization of commitment HRM showed less threat appraisals. Moreover, those experiencing fewer threat appraisals showed more commitment to their organizations. In addition, we found that the negative link between a company's commitment HRM and its employees' threat appraisals was pronounced when they had a lower level of trust in the government.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 18and March 27, 2020 were evaluated. Clinical features, laboratory data, complications and outcomes were compared between females and males. Risk factors for mortality in the whole population, females and males were determined respectively. RESULTS: There were 1667 (50.38%) females among the3309 patients included in this study. The mortality rate was only 5.9% in females but 12.7% in males. Compared with males, more females had no initial symptoms (11.1% vs 8.3%, p=0.008). Complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, cardiac injury and coagulation disorder were less common in females; critical illness was also significant less common in females (31.1% vs 39.4%, p<0.0001). Significantly fewer female patients received antibiotics treatment (p=0.001), antiviral therapy (p=0.025) glucocorticoids treatment (p<0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.0001) and had Intensive Care Unit admission (p<0.0001).

We aim to investigate predictors of the development of OI in the patients with AAD. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data of AAD in hypertensive patients from July 2012 to March 2020. The patients included in this study were divided into OI (+) group (oxygenation index200) and OI (?) group (oxygenation index> 200). Both groups were compared according to demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings. Characteristics of hypertension in the patients with AAD were described. Predictors for the development of OI were assessed. And cutoff values were determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were included in this study and the incidence of OI was 32.2%. In OI (+) group, patients had significantly higher peak body temperature (37.85  0.60 vs 37.64  0.44 C, P = .005), higher levels of CRP (42.70  28.27 vs 13.90  18.70 mg/L, P = .000) and procalcitonin (1.07  3.92 vs 0.31  0.77g/L, P = .027), and lower levels of albumin (34.21  5.65 vs 37.73  4.70 g/L, P = .000). Spearmans rank correlation test showed that the minimum oxygenation index was positively correlated with albumin, and was negatively correlated with the peak body temperature, serum CRP, procalcitonin, BNP and troponin. The stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independently associated with development of OI. An optimal cutoff value for CRP for predicting OI was 9.20 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 61.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The peak body temperature, serum CRP and albumin were independent predictors of OI development in the patients with AAD.

The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I2) measure. RESULTS: In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769; 95% CI :0.563-1.050; p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078; 95% CI: 0.908-1.279; p= 0.392).

Here we report on the experience of a cohort of patients treated with radiotherapy who opted for fully remote providers. Materials/Methods At the time of new visit consultation scheduling, patients were offered fully remote management if availability of onsite providers was limited. Additionally, after initial consultation with the treating oncologist, if patients expressed preference for treatment at a regional facility different from the oncologist's primary site, they were offered treatment at the preferred site with fully remote on-treatment visits, without transfer of care to an onsite provider. Potentially harmful patient safety events and near-misses were prospectively collected with an in-house quality improvement reporting system. Patient satisfaction surveys assessing several domains of the patient experience (including appointment logistics, patient-physician communication, and overall impressions) were distributed to patients before, during and after treatment. Results From 10/2020 to 2/2021, a total of 192 patients treated to 208 sites opted for fully remote management. 50% were male, 50% female. 61% of patients had metastatic disease. Sites treated included prostate (10%), breast (7%), thoracic (7%), head and neck (2%), gastrointestinal (25%), and other sites including bone, soft tissue and brain (49%). There were 46 minor (no harm or near-miss) patient safety events reported, of which 85% were unrelated to patient condition or physician communication and included events associated with treatment planning, orders, prescriptions and delivery. Minor events related to patient condition and patient scheduling/communication comprised 9% and 6% of events, respectively. There was 1 temporary harm event of patient decompensation in the department requiring activation of emergency services. The safety event rate per patient was similar between this cohort and non-remotely managed patients treated during the same period. The telemedicine survey response rate was 32%.

Identification of effective antiviral agents to combat the novel coronavirus is urgently needed. Citrus fruit peel or wild citrus are rich in flavonoids, and clinically documented for roles in relief of cough and promotion of digestive health. Therefore, citrus fruits are assumed to possess antivirus activities or enhance the host immunity. A previous study found that hesperetin could act as a high potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. We determined six flavonoid compounds content in three citrus species by using LCCMS technique. The content of naringin and naringenin was at higher levels in pummelo. Hesperetin and hesperidin were highly accumulated in mandarin and sweet orange. The subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that naringin could inhibit the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines (COX-2, iNOS, IL-1 and IL-6) induced by LPS in Raw macrophage cell line, and may restrain cytokine through inhibiting HMGB1 expression in a mouse model. The results revealed that naringin may have a potential application for preventing cytokine storm.

Therefore, they have a high risk of falls, which leads to severe health and psychological consequences and can induce fear of falling. Rehabilitation programs using exergames to prevent falls are being increasingly studied. Medimoov is a movement-based patient-personalized exergame for rehabilitation in older adults. A preliminary study showed that its use may influence functional ability and motivation. Most existing studies that evaluate the use of exergames do not involve an appropriate control group and do not focus on patient-personalized exergames. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of Medimoov on risk of falls and fear of falling in older adults compared with standard psychomotor rehabilitation. METHODS: This is a serial, comparative, randomized controlled group study. Both groups (n=25 in each) will receive psychomotor rehabilitation care. However, the methods of delivery will be different; one group will be exposed to the Medimoov exergame platform, and the other only to traditional means of psychomotor rehabilitation. The selection criteria will be (1) age of 65 years or older, (2) ability to answer a questionnaire, (3) ability to stand in a bipedal position for at least 1 minute, (4) score of 13 or greater on the Short Fall Efficacy Scale, and (5) stable medical condition. An evaluation will be made prior to starting the intervention, after 4 weeks of intervention, and at the end of the intervention (after 8 weeks), and it will focus on (1) risk of falls, (2) fear of falling, and (3) cognitive evaluations. Physical activity outside the session will also be assessed by actimetry. The outcome assessment will be performed according to intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: The protocol (2019-11-22) has been approved by the Comit de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest ICUniversit de Rouen (2019-A00395-52), which is part of the French national ethical committee. The study received funding in February 2020. As of October 2020 (submission date), and due to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 10 participants out of 50 had been enrolled in the study. The projected date for the end of the data collection is December 2021. Data analyses have not been started yet, and publication of the results is expected for Spring 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of psychomotor rehabilitation using the Medimoov exergame platform on the risk and fear of falls will be evaluated. This pilot study will be the basis for larger trials.

Methods: This was a case-control study in seven EDs in Hong Kong from 20 January to 29 February 2020. Thirty-seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were age- and gender-matched to 111 controls. We compared the groups with univariate analysis and calculated the odds ratio (OR) of having COVID-19 for each characteristic that was significantly different between the groups with adjustment for age and presumed location of acquiring the infection. Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and reported symptoms between the groups. A positive contact history within 14 days (adjusted OR 37.61, 95% CI 10.86-130.19), bilateral chest radiograph shadow (adjusted OR 13.19, 95% CI 4.66-37.35), having prior medical consultation (adjusted OR 7.43, 95% 2.89 -19.09), a lower white blood cell count (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.51), and a lower platelet count (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.12) were associated with a higher odds of COVID-19 separately. A higher neutrophil count was associated with a lower odds of COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91).

DESIGN Qualitative descriptive study using data from a survey of bereaved family members of Veterans administered from March-June 2020. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. SETTING VA medical centers with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases during the study period. PARTICIPANTS Next-of-kin of 328 Veterans who died in one of 37 VA medical centers' acute care, intensive care, nursing home, or hospice units. MEASUREMENTS Open-ended survey questions (response rate = 37%) about family member's perceptions of: 1) communication with the healthcare team about the patient, 2) communication with the patient, and 3) use of remote communication technologies. RESULTS Bereaved family members identified contextual factors perceived to impact communication quality including: allowing family at the bedside when death is imminent, fears that the patient died alone, and overall perceptions of VA care. Characteristics of perceived high-quality communication included staff availability for remote communication and being kept informed of the patient's condition and plan of care. Low-quality communication with staff was perceived to result from limited access to staff, insufficient updates regarding the patient's condition, and when the family member was not consulted about care decision-making. Communication quality with the patient was facilitated or impeded by the availability and use of video-enabled remote technologies. CONCLUSION Communication between patients, families, and healthcare teams at the end of life remains critically important during times of limited in-person visitation. Families report that low-quality communication causes profound distress that can affect the quality of dying and bereavement.

She had a concomitant metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.46, HCO3- 40 mmol/L, pCO2 54.6 mmHg). A history of significant Quick-Eze use (a calcium carbonate based antacid) for abdominal discomfort, for 2 weeks prior to presentation, suggested a diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome (MAS). Further investigations did not demonstrate malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism. Following management with i.v. fluid rehydration and a single dose of i.v. bisphosphonate, she developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia requiring oral and parenteral calcium replacement.

This study proposes a potential vaccine construct targeting mucor and rhizopus species responsible for mucormycosis infections, providing immunoprotection to immunocompromised patients. The vaccine construct, with an antigenicity score of 0.75 covering, on average, 92C98% of the world population, was designed using an immunoinformatics approach. Molecular interactions with major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-I), Toll-like receptors-2 (TLR2), and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), with scores of ?896.0, ?948.4, and ?925.0, respectively, demonstrated its potential to bind with the human immune receptors. It elicited a strong predicted innate and adaptive immune response in the form of helper T (Th) cells, cytotoxic T (TC) cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. The vaccine cloned in the pBR322 vector showed positive amplification, further solidifying its stability and potential. The proposed construct holds a promising approach as the first step towards an antimucormycosis vaccine and may contribute to minimizing postdiagnostic burdens and failures.","output":"A Vaccine Construction against COVID-19-Associated Mucormycosis Contrived with Immunoinformatics-Based Scavenging of Potential Mucoralean Epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative damages in hepatocytes may be caused by epilepsy and/or anticonvulsant drugs. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by recurrent seizures, which may increase the content of reactive oxygen species. Organic and conventional grape juices are rich in polyphenols, compounds with important antioxidant activity. It is hypothesized that organic and conventional purple grape juices may have protective effect against oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a standard convulsant drug) in the liver and serum of Wistar rats. Animals (n = 16 in each group) received, by gavage, saline, organic grape juice or conventional grape juice (10 L/g of body weight) for 17 days. Subsequently, half of the rats in each group received PTZ (60 mg/kg). After 30 minutes, the animals were euthanized by decapitation. Liver and blood samples were isolated to evaluate oxidative parameters (lipid and protein oxidation, nitric oxide metabolite content, antioxidant defenses, and protein sulfhydryl content). The results of this study showed that although organic juice contains higher polyphenol content than conventional juice, both juices conferred protection against lipid and protein oxidative damage and limited the increase in PTZ-induced nitric oxide metabolite content in the liver and serum. In addition, both juices inhibited the PTZ-induced reduction in enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and sulfhydryl protein content in the liver and serum. In summary, both organic and conventional grape juices were able to reduce oxidative damage induced by PTZ in the liver and serum of Wistar rats.","output":"Purple grape juices prevent pentylenetetrazol-induced oxidative damage in the liver and serum of Wistar rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Outbreak of Coronatirus (COVID-19) came to the world in early December 2019 The early cases of conronavirus were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China Till May 18, 2020, 198 countries hate been affected by this life-threatening disease The most common and known traits of COVID-19 are tiredness, fever, and dry cough In this paper, we hate discussed the Predictive data mining approach for COVID-19 predictions In Predictive data mining, a model is developed and trained using supervised framing and then it predicts the behavior of provided data Predictive data mining is a renowned technique known to many health organizations for the classification and prediction of diseases such as Heart disease and various types of cancers etc There are several factors for comparing the model's accuracy, scalability, and interpretability This predictive model is compared to the basics of its accuracy In this proposed approach, are have used WEKA as it provides a vast collection of many machine learning algorithms The main objective of this paper is to forecast the possible future incidence of corona cases in Pakistan This study concludes that the number of corona cases will increase swiftly If the government take proactive steps and strictly implement precautionary measures, then Pakistan may be able to overcome this pandemic","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Incidence Using Data Mining Techniques: A case study of Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influence of human genetics on the natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may be diminished in endemic areas because infection at a young age predisposes to chronic HBV infection. The present study aimed to address this issue through the determination of the influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of myxovirus resistence-1 (MxA) -88 G/T and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874 A/T on the natural history of HBV infection in endemic regions. One hundred adult patients with self-limiting HBV infection (positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc) and 340 adult patients with persistent HBV infection were recruited from southern China, an endemic area with an HBsAg carrier rate of 17.8%. SNPs of MxA -88 G/T and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874 A/T were typed using a protocol based on competitively differentiated polymerase chain reaction. A highly significant difference in the distribution of MxA -88 G/T was observed between those with persistent and self-limiting HBV infections. The latter displayed a lower frequency of the GG genotype (41.0% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.036) and a higher frequency of the TT genotype (16.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.000), compared to patients with persistent infection. These differences were not gender- or age-specific. However, a significant distribution difference of IFN-gamma +874 A/T was not observed.

Reports of recent outbreaks of a SARS-like disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have raised serious concerns of a possible reemergence of SARS-CoV, either by laboratory escape or the presence of a natural reservoir. Therefore, the development of effective and safe SARS vaccines is still needed. Based on our previous studies, we believe that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is the most important target for developing a SARS vaccine. In particular, RBD of S protein contains the critical neutralizing domain (CND), which is able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against divergent SARS-CoV strains. Furthermore, a RBD-based subunit vaccine is expected to be safer than other vaccines that may induce Th2-type immunopathology. This review will discuss key advances in the development of RBD-based SARS vaccines and the possibility of using a similar strategy to develop vaccines against MERS-CoV.","output":"Receptor-binding domain as a target for developing SARS vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autophagy is directed by numerous distinct autophagy-related (Atg) proteins.

While epidemiological factors have been well studied, the influence of a proximal humeral fracture on morbidity, mortality and associated costs has not yet been adequately analysed. METHOD On a basis of 4.1 million insurance holders of the German public health insurance (GKV), patients with (study population, SP) and without (comparison group, VG) a proximal humeral fracture (pHF) were compared with regard to comorbidity, rehospitalisation, mortality, drug and aid needs as well as number of physician contacts. Study period was between 2012 and 2016. RESULTS 6068 patients of the SP met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (age 69.4  14.3 years; male : female = 28.2% : 71.8%). 4781 patients (78.8%) received surgical, 1287 patients (21.2%) conservative treatment of the pHF. Rehospitalisations and visits to the general practitioner occurred more frequently in the SP vs. VG (p < 0.01). Contacts with specialists after pHF varied according to specialty, as did newly occurring diseases. Typical specialities for preventive examinations were significantly less common (gynaecology p < 0.01, pathology p < 0.01, dermatology p < 0.01). According to pHF, the costs of SP for drugs (2490.76  1395.51  vs. 2167.86  1314.43 ; p = 0.04), medical therapies (867.01  238.67  vs. 393.26  217.55 ; p < 0.01) and aids (821.02  415.73  vs. 513.52  368.76 ; p < 0.01) were significantly above the VG. The two-year survival after pHF is lower in the SP than in the VG (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION The results show increased morbidity and mortality as well as medical costs after a proximal humeral fracture. Preventive examinations and treatments are rarer. In the future, care concepts for patients with proximal humeral fractures should not only be optimised with regard to functional scores and reduced complication rates, but also with regard to quality of life and preservation of general health.","output":"Health Care for Inpatients with a Proximal Humeral Fracture - an Analysis of Health Insurance Data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Third COVID-19 vaccine doses are broadly recommended, but immunogenicity data remain limited, particularly in older adults. METHODS: We measured circulating antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain, ACE2 displacement, and virus neutralization against ancestral and Omicron (BA.1) strains from pre-vaccine up to one month following the third dose, in 151 adults aged 24-98 years who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. RESULTS: Following two vaccine doses, humoral immunity was weaker, less functional and less durable in older adults, where a higher number of chronic health conditions was a key correlate of weaker responses and poorer durability. One month after the third dose, antibody concentrations and function exceeded post-second-dose levels, and responses in older adults were comparable in magnitude to those in younger adults at this time. Humoral responses against Omicron were universally weaker than against the ancestral strain after both the second and third doses. Nevertheless, after three doses, anti-Omicron responses in older adults reached equivalence to those in younger adults. One month after three vaccine doses, the number of chronic health conditions, but not age, was the strongest consistent correlate of weaker humoral responses.

complications of acute coronary syndrome. Clopidogrel plus acetylsalicylic acid combination is the most commonly used dual antiplatelet therapy recommended by international guidelines and in Chinese clinical practice. Poor adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy or premature interruption of dual antiplatelet therapy is an important contributor to cardiovascular mortality and lethal cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid fixed-dose combination enhances adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy. Herein, we aimed to evaluate bioequivalence of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel in fixed-dose combination compared with simultaneous administration of their individual formulations in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. METHODS: This was a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-sequence, three-period, two-treatment, crossover study with a washout period of 10 days conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive Co-Plavix? (test formulation- fixed-dose combination of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) once and reference formulations (coadministration of individual formulations of 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel) twice during the study period. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed for acetylsalicylic acid, its metabolite salicylic acid, clopidogrel, and its metabolite SR26334. As acetylsalicylic acid shows high intrasubject variability, the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) approach was implemented for acetylsalicylic acid analysis, while bioequivalence of clopidogrel was assessed using the average bioequivalence method. Point ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC, AUClast, and Cmax for acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomized and 170 subjects were treated with test or reference formulation; 164 subjects completed the study. Regarding acetylsalicylic acid exposure, as reference within-subject standard deviation (SDW) was at least 0.294 for acetylsalicylic acid Cmax, AUClast, and AUC, the RSABE analysis method was used to assess bioequivalence for all three parameters. The point estimates were within the 0.80-1.25 range (1.19, 1.09, and 1.04, respectively), and upper one-sided 95% CIs of scaled average bioequivalence metric were at most 0 (- 0.30, - 0.14, and - 0.10, respectively). Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated with acetylsalicylic acid. Bioequivalence was also achieved with clopidogrel as the 90% CIs for geometric mean ratios of clopidogrel Cmax, AUClast, and AUC were within the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25).

We included individual studies reporting on a wide range of mental health outcomes, including risk and protective factors, conducted in children and adolescents (aged  19 years), exposed to COVID-19 lockdown. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by independent researchers, and results were synthesised by core themes. 61 articles with 54,999 children and adolescents were included (mean age = 11.3 years, 49.7% female). Anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms were common in the included studies and ranged 1.8C49.5% and 2.2C63.8%, respectively. Irritability (range = 16.7C73.2%) and anger (range = 30.0C51.3%), were also frequently reported by children and adolescents. Special needs and the presence of mental disorders before the lockdown, alongside excessive media exposure, were significant risk factors for anxiety. ParentCchild communication was protective for anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in psychological distress and highlighted vulnerable groups such as those with previous or current mental health difficulties.

Methods: Laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 with an elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) level (&gt;10 pg/ml) were offered TCZ intravenously for compassionate use. Clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, and chest imaging before and after the administration of TCZ were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 58 consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria and with no compliance to the exclusion criteria were included. Of these 58 patients, 39 patients received TCZ treatment, and 19 patients who declined TCZ treatment were used as the control cohort. In the TCZ-treatment group, 6 patients (15.4%) were in mild condition, 16 (41.0%) were in severe condition, and 17 (43.6%) were in critical condition. After TCZ treatment, the condition of 27 patients (69.2%) improved and 12 (30.8%) died.

Health care providers in the United States often lack confidence to provide appropriate FGM/C-related care, and experience attitudes that may negatively impact quality of care for FGM/C. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care providers to explore the associations between health care provider characteristics, awareness of health complications of FGM/C, attitudes, and confidence for FGM/C care. Results: Factors associated with more Confidence for Clinical FGM/C Care include awareness of health complications, ever cared for a woman with FGM/C, being a woman or person of color, and more than 5 years of clinical practice. Increased Confidence in Communication Skills for FGM/C Care was associated with awareness of more health complications for FGM/C. Women endorsed significantly less Negative Attitudes toward FGM/C compared with men; no other factors were associated with health care provider attitudes. Conclusion: Future research should further investigate factors associated with health care provider attitudes toward FGM/C and those affected by the practice to promote quality care. Health providers require adequate training for clinical FGM/C care and in the communication skills that promote patient/provider communication cross-culturally.

This has forced a paradigm shift by disrupting 'normal' human life, introducing what is now seen as a 'new normal', which can also be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat. HEIs have equally been affected by this situation, which has forced conventional delivery of teaching and learning to be replaced by distance, online, or blended learning styles. Prior to the pandemic, only slightly over 25% of all students in UK HEIs received teaching and learning online. This statistic has now grown to 85%. This concerns learners' engagement with online learning. Unlike traditional classroom teaching/learning, online learning faces challenges of ensuring the engagement of learners. This chapter aims to explore and discuss measures to enhance student engagement in online learning settings within HEIs. The main objectives are two-fold.

Using the Trinity of Voice theory concepts of access, standing, and influence, we discuss how each has been and can be impacted by virtual vs. in-person public participation in federal land governance. Lessons are drawn from two peer-to-peer learning sessions among Forest Service staff in Fall 2020 and a case from the National Forests in North Carolina. Virtual participation can broaden access to processes that would primarily have taken place in-person as people were not limited by travel time or distance. Virtual methods may allow for greater use of adaptive technologies and therefore may increase participation access. Web meeting alternatives (e.g., telephone calls) can be used to increase participation access for those without reliable or affordable internet. However, planners trained in facilitating in-person meetings may not have the technical competencies necessary to ensure participants are able to effectively participate during virtual meetings, and misunderstandings that might be easily addressed in face-to-face settings can be more difficult to solve and ground rules for participation ignored more easily during virtual participation.

This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020. CURRENT PRACTICE: Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice. RECOMMENDATIONS: The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE: The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.","output":"Remdesivir for severe covid-19: a clinical practice guideline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers is critical to the quality of patient care, and effective function of health services. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated. The creation of a culturally-sensitive interdisciplinary blueprint for locally-viable actions model are strongly suggested ahead of future emergency situations.","output":"Psychological distress and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a developing context during COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for workplace wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with abnormal liver function tests. We hypothesized that early altered liver biochemistries at admission might have different clinical relevance than subsequent changes during hospitalization. A single-center retrospective study was conducted on 540 consecutive hospitalized patients, PCR-diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Liver test abnormalities were defined as the elevation of either gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), above the upper limit of normality set by our laboratory. Linear mixed models (LMM) evaluated longitudinal associations, incorporating all available follow-up laboratory chemistries. By the end of the follow-up period, 502 patients (94.5%) were discharged (109 (20.5%) died). A total of 319 (64.3%) had at least one abnormal liver test result at admission. More prevalent were elevated AST (40.9%) and GGT (47.3%). Abnormalities were not associated with survival but with respiratory complications at admission. Conversely, LMM models adjusted for age and sex showed that longitudinal increases during hospitalization in ferritin, GGT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as a decreased albumin levels, were associated with reduced survival. This dual pattern of liver damage might reconcile previous conflicting reports.

H. somni is a member of the bovine respiratory disease complex that causes severe bronchopneumonia in cattle. Previously, it has been reported that bovine neutrophils and macrophages have limited ability to phagocytose and kill H. somni. Recently, it was discovered that bovine neutrophils and macrophages produce extracellular traps in response to Mannheimia haemolytica, another member of the bovine respiratory disease complex. In this study, we demonstrate that H. somni also causes extracellular trap production by bovine neutrophils in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which did not coincide with the release of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for necrosis. Neutrophil extracellular traps were produced in response to outer membrane vesicles, but not lipooligosacchride alone. Using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, we observed H. somni cells trapped within a web-like structure. Further analyses demonstrated that bovine neutrophils trapped and killed H. somni in a DNA-dependent manner. Treatment of DNA extracellular traps with DNase I freed H. somni cells and diminished bacterial death. Treatment of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages with H. somni cells also caused macrophage extracellular trap formation. These findings suggest that extracellular traps may play a role in the host response to H. somni infection in cattle.","output":"Histophilus somni causes extracellular trap formation by bovine neutrophils and macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell entry of enveloped viruses requires specialized viral proteins that mediate fusion with the host membrane by substantial structural rearrangements from a metastable pre- to a stable postfusion conformation. This metastability renders the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) fusion glycoprotein B (gB) highly unstable such that it readily converts into the postfusion form, thereby precluding structural elucidation of the pharmacologically relevant prefusion conformation. By identification of conserved sequence signatures and molecular dynamics simulations, we devised a mutation that stabilized this form. Functionally locking gB allowed the structural determination of its membrane-embedded prefusion conformation at sub-nanometer resolution and enabled the unambiguous fit of all ectodomains. The resulting pseudo-atomic model reveals a notable conservation of conformational domain rearrangements during fusion between HSV-1 gB and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G, despite their very distant phylogeny. In combination with our comparative sequence-structure analysis, these findings suggest common fusogenic domain rearrangements in all class III viral fusion proteins.","output":"The prefusion structure of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a decrease in renal function or glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and proteinuria is often present. Proteinuria increases with age and can be caused by glomerular and/or proximal tubule (PT) alterations. PT cells have an apical brush border membrane (BBM), which is a highly dynamic, organized, and specialized membrane region containing multiple glycoproteins required for its functions including regulating uptake, secretion, and signaling dependent upon the physiologic state. PT disorders contribute to the dysfunction observed in CKD. Many glycoprotein functions have been attributed to their N- and O-glycans, which are highly regulated and complex. In this study, the O-glycans present in rat BBMs from animals with different levels of kidney disease and proteinuria were characterized and analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCCMS/MS). A principal component analysis (PCA) documented that each group has distinct O-glycan distributions. Higher fucosylation levels were observed in the CKD and diabetic groups, which may contribute to PT dysfunction by altering physiologic glycoprotein interactions. Fucosylated O-glycans such as 1-1-1-0 exhibited higher abundance in the severe proteinuric groups.

In this review, we will present recent pediatric studies informing our current understanding of COVID-19 in children, and review pediatric considerations surrounding disease transmission, currently available therapies, and vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have shed light on the clinical epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children, identifying a high prevalence of asymptomatic and mild infections, with severe COVID-19 infrequently reported. Several adult clinical trials have informed the use of remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies, dexamethasone, and tocilizumab in the management of COVID-19. Associations between underlying comorbid medical conditions and severe outcomes, as well as transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in children, are complex and warrant further study. Finally, highly efficacious vaccines are available for adults and adolescents, with pediatric trials ongoing.

Objective: To investigate potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection with epidemiologic evidence from a COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined a community COVID-19 outbreak in Zhejiang province. On January 19, 2020, 128 individuals took 2 buses (60 [46.9%] from bus 1 and 68 [53.1%] from bus 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on bus 2. We compared risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection among at-risk individuals taking bus 1 (n = 60) and bus 2 (n = 67 [source patient excluded]) and among all other individuals (n = 172) attending the worship event. We also divided seats on the exposed bus into high-risk and low-risk zones according to the distance from the source patient and compared COVID-19 risks in each zone. In both buses, central air conditioners were in indoor recirculation mode. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by viral genome sequencing results. Attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated for different groups, and the spatial distribution of individuals who developed infection on bus 2 was obtained. Results: Of the 128 participants, 15 (11.7%) were men, 113 (88.3%) were women, and the mean age was 58.6 years. On bus 2, 24 of the 68 individuals (35.3% [including the index patient]) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after the event. Meanwhile, none of the 60 individuals in bus 1 were infected. Among the other 172 individuals at the worship event, 7 (4.1%) subsequently received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Individuals in bus 2 had a 34.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-46.3%) higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared with those in bus 1 and were 11.4 (95% CI, 5.1-25.4) times more likely to have COVID-19 compared with all other individuals attending the worship event. Within bus 2, individuals in high-risk zones had moderately, but nonsignificantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared with those in the low-risk zones. The absence of a significantly increased risk in the part of the bus closer to the index case suggested that airborne spread of the virus may at least partially explain the markedly high attack rate observed. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study and case investigation of a community outbreak of COVID-19 in Zhejiang province, individuals who rode a bus to a worship event with a patient with COVID-19 had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individuals who rode another bus to the same event. Airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 seems likely to have contributed to the high attack rate in the exposed bus. Future efforts at prevention and control must consider the potential for airborne spread of the virus.","output":"Community Outbreak Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Bus Riders in Eastern China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education can be coined as one of the indispensable domains that got colossally effected due to this persisting timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Little is known about people's health behaviours and perceptions during cruise holidays. METHODS: Narrative group interviews and respondent photo diary exercises were conducted with families (n = 25) residing in different areas across metropolitan NSW, Australia. Guided by a social practice theoretical approach we undertook a thematic analysis that identifies reasons for choosing a cruise, health considerations and behaviours in relation to cruise travel and awareness of official cruise health information. RESULTS: Cruise travel included a licence to abandon cautious behaviours, reinforced by confidence in the cruise organiser's risk management ability. Health concerns were not a high priority for participants and were mainly understood in terms of eating healthy, modest exercise, managing seasickness and having adequate supplies of medications. Awareness of official cruise health and risk information was largely non-existent. CONCLUSION: Understanding how travel health practices emerge and are likely to be modifiable produces health-promoting awareness and intervention efforts that recognise and link with people's ideas about cruise holidays as times of fun, leisure, relaxation, without interfering with or imposing on them. SO WHAT?: This study highlights the importance of developing health communication and promotion strategies that are responsive to the interconnected meanings, competencies and materials that have a bearing on how cruise travellers understand and enact health-related behaviours in preparation for and during a cruise holiday.","output":"Between the sea and the sky: A social practice investigation into health behaviours during cruise travel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created obstacles for medical student education, as clinical rotations were temporarily halted Recent literature shows online electives may provide an alternative learning platform We developed a tele-ophthalmology student elective for rising third-year (MS3) and fourth-year (MS4) medical students to continue teaching and exposure to the field Methods: A 4-week remote elective was approved by Emory University School of Medicine and offered between April 18, 2020 to May 15, 2020 for rising MS3 and MS4 students The curriculum consisted of online self-study materials, student presentations, chart review assignments, case-based discussions with faculty, and telehealth experiences All students were surveyed and tested with questions from USMLE World (UWorld) test bank at the end of the course Results: A total of 18 students enrolled, with 66 7% MS3 and 33 3% MS4 participance The mean rating of fulfillment of course learning objectives was 8 1/10 (range, 6 7-8 8), with mean ratings of 8 2 for MS3s and 7 7 for MS4s There was a significant increase in self-reported knowledge in ophthalmology, with an increase from 4 6 to 8 1 for MS3s (p=0 002) and 6 7 to 8 0 for MS4s (p=0 04) Students also reported higher interest in the field, with an increase from 4 9 to 7 8 for MS3s (p=0 01) and 7 5 to 8 7 for MS4s (p=0 1) The students performed significantly higher on the post-course test (94 8%) than UWorld question bank users (74 1%) (p&lt;0 001) Conclusion: Our novel ophthalmology elective significantly enhanced self-reported medical student knowledge and interest in the field during a crisis that required transition to remote learning Further study of student telehealth experience and objective assessment is needed to improve online learning in ophthalmology","output":"Ophthalmology Education in COVID-19: A Remote Elective for Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The overwhelming majority of Americans with disabilities live in metropolitan areas. Yet those areas continue to contain significant barriers that keep disabled people from fully participating in city life. Although political and social debate has periodically turned its attention to urban issues or problems  or even the so-called urban crisis  during the past several decades, it has too rarely attended to the issues of disability access. When political debate has focused on disability issues, it has tended to address them in a nationally uniform way, without paying attention to the particular concerns of disabled people in cities. Even when city leaders have focused attention directly on the impact of disability policy on their municipalities  for example, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendells attacks in the mid-1990s on the Americans with Disabilities Acts (ADA) requirement to install curb cuts  they have done so as part of a more general attack on mandates on state and local governments, in and out of the disability context. This essay, written for a symposium on disability and the city, asks the question of what we should want from an urban disability agenda. It begins by setting out some principles that should guide such an agenda. It then highlights some of the key barriers, in existing law and politics, for achieving those principles. In the last section, a brief conclusion, it speculates on the prospects for addressing those barriers  and ask whether the COVID-19 pandemic has made effective action on this front more or less likely.This contribution is an exercise in issue-spotting. Its goal is not to set forth a detailed critique of any current urban policy, nor is it to offer any particular path forward.

METHODS This cross-sectional study included all urban and rural counties in the United States. County-level HL data were estimated using 2010 US Census and 2011 American Community Surveys data; EOL expenditures in 2010 were derived from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care database. Hierarchical generalized linear regressions were used to assess associations between HL and EOL care, controlling for county-level characteristics and focusing on rurality (with areas classified as urban, rural micropolitan, or rural noncore). FINDINGS Of 3,137 US counties, 100 (3.2%) counties where 7.6 million Americans live had low HL (LHL). Counties with LHL had significantly higher average expenditures in the last 6 months of life and during terminal hospitalization than counties with high HL (HHL) (both P < .001). There was a statistically significant interaction between HL and rurality (P < .001). EOL expenditures were significantly higher in LHL counties than HHL counties in urban areas, while no such relationship appeared in rural areas. Average estimated EOL expenditures among LHL counties decreased by rurality ($16,953, $14,939, and $12,671 for urban, rural micropolitan, and rural noncore areas, respectively), while average estimated expenditures in HHL counties were around $14,000 in each of these areas. CONCLUSIONS HL and EOL expenditures were inversely associated with urban America but unrelated to rural areas. Counties with HHL had constant expenditures regardless of rurality. Interventions targeting HL may help reduce EOL expenditures and rural-urban disparities in EOL care.","output":"Associations Among Health Literacy, End-of-Life Care Expenditures, and Rurality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a frequently used plasticizer that may be linked to the development of endometriosis, a common gynecological disorder with a profound impact on quality of life. Despite its prevalence, vital access to treatment has often been hampered by a lack of understanding of its pathogenesis as well as reliable disease models. Recently, epithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT) has been suggested to have a significant role in endometriosis pathophysiology. In this study, we found that DEHP treatment enhanced proliferation, migration, and inflammatory responses, along with EMT and stemness induction in human endometrial and endometriotic cells. The selective transforming growth factor- (TGF-) receptor type 1/2 inhibitor LY2109761 reversed the DEHP-induced cell proliferation and migration enhancement as well as the increased expression of crucial molecules involved in inflammation, EMT, and stemness, indicating that DEHP-triggered phenomena occur via the TGF-/Smad signaling pathway. Our study clearly defines the role of DEHP in the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of endometriosis and establishes an efficient disease model for endometriosis using a biomimetic 3D cell culture technique. Altogether, our data provide novel etiological and mechanistic insights into the role of DEHP in endometriosis pathogenesis, opening avenues for developing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for endometriosis.","output":"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate Triggers Proliferation, Migration, Stemness, and EpithelialCMesenchymal Transition in Human Endometrial and Endometriotic Epithelial Cells via the Transforming Growth Factor-/Smad Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion protein mediates the viruss fusion activity, which is a determinant of NDV pathogenicity. The ectodomain of the F protein is known to have a major impact on fusion, and several reports have also indicated the role of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) in viral entry, F protein cleavage, and fusion, which are regulated by specific motifs. We found a highly conserved tyrosine residue located in the YLMY motif. The tyrosine residues at positions 524 and 527 have different roles in viral replication and pathogenicity and are associated with F protein intracellular processing. Tyrosine residues mutants affect the transportation of the F protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, resulting in different cleavage efficiencies. F protein is subsequently transported to the cell surface where it participates in viral budding, a process closely related to the distinctions in pathogenicity caused by the tyrosine residues. In addition, the different mutations all led to a hypofusogenic phenotype. We believe that the highly conserved tyrosine residue of the YLMY motif uses a similar mechanism to the tyrosine-based motif (YXX) to regulate F protein transport and thus affect viral replication and pathogenicity. IMPORTANCE The amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of paramyxovirus fusion glycoproteins include trafficking signals that influence protein processing and cell surface expression. This study clarified that tyrosine residues at different positions in the YLMY motif in the cytoplasmic region of the F protein regulate F protein transportation, thereby affecting viral replication and pathogenicity. This study has increased our understanding of how NDV virulence is mediated by the F protein and provides a fresh perspective on the role of CT in the viruss life cycle. This information may be useful in the development of NDV as an effective vaccine vector and oncolytic agent.","output":"YLMY Tyrosine Residue within the Cytoplasmic Tail of Newcastle Disease Virus Fusion Protein Regulates Its Surface Expression to Modulate Viral Budding and Pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has causes life-changing impacts such as new environmental policies, slowdown of world economy and impact on global health and society. Police officers are among the front liners who continue to bravely fight this pandemic. As the frontline in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, police officers are at high risk for many forms of psychological problems which includes anxiety and depression. It is reported that a total of 60 officers from the New York Police Department died from suicide due to mental health disturbance and approximately 95 police officers in China died on the frontline of fighting this outbreak. Thus, it is important to provide appropriate mental health services and to be able to do such, there is the need to understand the psychological risk factors and their subsequent needs during pandemic. The main purpose of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to mental health of Malaysian police officers. Methods & Materials Police Stress Questionnaires (PSQ) was used to measure the police-specific stressors related with COVID-19. Meanwhile, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) questionnaires use to determine the prevalence of occupational stress among police officers. Results It is found that the highest percentage reported of 41.1% moderate depression, 45% of moderate anxiety and 31.8% moderate stress among the respondents. Lack of resources, unequal sharing of work responsibilities, inadequate equipment and high risk to COVID-19 infection are associated with depression, anxiety and stress among police officers. There is significant correlation between COVID-19 stressors and level of depression, anxiety and stress among the police officers with direct correlation. Conclusion Majority of the police officers suffer moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress during COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of echocardiography in assessing the anatomy of coronary arteries in neonates with transposition of the great arteries, and determine impact on outcomes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of data in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Preoperative echocardiographic coronary artery pattern and surgical intraoperative reports were compared. Mismatch between transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports and the impact on perioperative outcome were assessed. Coronary patterns were classified into four groups: type 1 (normal); type 2 (risk of coronary with intramural course); type 3 (coronary loop); and type 2+3. RESULTS Overall, 108 neonates who underwent an arterial switch operation were included: 68 were classified as type 1; seven as type 2; 32 as type 3; and one as type 2+3. Overall, 10 adverse events occurred. Five patients died, three from coronary causes. Survival was 96% at 1 month. Transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports differed in 17.6% of cases. Mortality was 15.8% in case of inappropriate diagnosis and 2.2% for appropriate diagnosis (P=0.01). Mortality in type 2 was 66.7% in case of discordance versus 0% when concordant. Multivariable analysis found that inappropriate preoperative transthoracic echocardiography diagnosis of coronary pattern was the only significant risk factor for mortality (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Echocardiography can assess coronary artery anatomy in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Intramural coronary course is often misdiagnosed. Preoperative misdiagnosis of coronary artery anomaly may impact perioperative mortality. However, this assessment will have to be confirmed by further larger studies.","output":"Value of preoperative echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery patterns in neonates with transposition of the great arteries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic introduced a global crisis for the healthcare systems. Research has paid particular attention to hospitals and intensive care units. However, nursing homes and home care services in charge of a highly vulnerable group of patients have also been forced to adapt and transform to ensure the safety of patients and staff; yet they have not received enough research attention. This paper aims to explore how leaders in nursing homes and home care services used innovative solutions to handle the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure resilient performance during times of disruption and major challenges. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory case study was used to understand the research question. The selected case was a large city municipality in Norway. This specific municipality was heavily affected by the Covid-19 pandemic; therefore, information from this municipality allowed us to gather rich information. Data were collected from documents, semi-structured interviews, and a survey. At the first interview phase, informants included 13 leaders, Head of nursing home (1 participant), Head of Sec. (4 participants), Quality manager (4 participants), Head of nursing home ward (3 participants), and a Professional development nurse (1 participant), at 13 different nursing homes and home care services. At the second phase, an online survey was distributed at 16 different nursing homes and home care services to expand our understanding of the phenomenon from other leaders within the case municipality. Twenty-two leaders responded to the survey. The full dataset was analysed in accordance with inductive thematic analysis methodology. RESULTS: The empirical results from the analysis provide a new understanding of how nursing homes and home care leaders used innovative solutions to maintain appropriate care for infected and non-infected patients at their sites. The results showed that innovative solutions could be separated into technology for communication and remote care, practice innovations, service innovations, and physical innovations. CONCLUSION: This study offers a new understanding of the influence of crisis-driven innovation for resilience in healthcare during the Covid-19 pandemic. Nursing home and home care leaders implemented several innovative solutions to ensure resilient performance during the first 6C9 months of the pandemic. In terms of resilience, different innovative solutions can be divided based on their influence into situational, structural, and systemic resilience. A framework for bridging innovative solutions and their influence on resilience in healthcare is outlined in the paper.","output":"Healthcare leaders use of innovative solutions to ensure resilience in healthcare during the Covid-19 pandemic: a qualitative study in Norwegian nursing homes and home care services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new and deadly virus known as SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is spreading rapidly around the world causing more than 4 million deaths. Hence, there is an urgent need to find new and innovative ways to reduce the likelihood of infection. One of the most common ways of catching the virus is by being in contact with droplets delivered by a sick person. The risk can be reduced by wearing a face mask as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), especially in closed environments such as classrooms, hospitals, and supermarkets. However, people hesitate to use a face mask leading to an increase in the risk of spreading the disease, moreover when the face mask is used, sometimes it is worn in the wrong way. In this work, an autonomic face mask detection system with deep learning and powered by the image tracking technique used for the augmented reality development is proposed as a mechanism to request the correct use of face masks to grant access to people to critical areas. To achieve this, a machine learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks was built on top of an IoT framework to enforce the correct use of the face mask in required areas as it is requested by law in some regions. ? 2021 Sociedad Mexicana de Ingenieria Biomedica.

The present study evaluates the effect of the Smile Train project on the demographics of cleft deformities. METHOD Data collected over the past three decades were studied retrospectively. The number of cases, age at presentation, and relative proportion of cleft lip-cleft palate patients were analyzed. Thirty patients operated on at the authors' institute for cleft lip deformity were evaluated for their awareness of cleft deformities, and the results were compared with those of 22 patients operated on elsewhere in camp settings. RESULTS The numbers of patients with cleft deformities treated at the authors' institute from 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, and 2000 to 2009 were 1189, 1050, and 374, respectively. However, the number with cleft palate has remained nearly constant over the three decades. The mean age of reporting for treatment of cleft palate was 16 months after being operated on for cleft lip at the authors' institute and 41 months after being operated on elsewhere in camps. All patients operated on at the authors' institute expressed awareness of holistic treatment of cleft deformities. Of the 22 patients operated on at other camps, 16 were ignorant about the time scale and 19 were unaware of the consequences of nonadherence to the treatment protocol. Nineteen of the 22 patients felt that enough information was not provided to them at initial surgery. CONCLUSION The authors recommend that cleft counseling, continued cleft care for the complete complex of deformities, and responsible behavior by the initial operating team should be the goals for the future.","output":"Changing patterns in demography of cleft lip-cleft palate deformities in a developing country: the Smile Train effect--what lies ahead?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 due to their professional exposition to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study assesses the intention of vaccination against COVID-19 before the vaccines were approved, and the rate of vaccine uptake during the first nine months of immunization among HCWs. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was carried out during July 2020 in University Clinical Hospital Center Bezanijska Kosa in Belgrade, Serbia that included 62.8% of all HCWs. Besides serological testing for IgG antibodies, data about HCWs' intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination if a vaccine became available were collected. This cohort of HCWs was followed up until the end of October 2021 to assess the number of vaccinated and PCR-positive staff. In the cross-sectional study, 18.3% HCWs had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies without difference with IgG-negative HCWs regarding age, gender, profession type, and years of service. Before vaccines became available, a significantly higher percentage of IgG-positive HCWs compared to IgG-negative HCWs was unsure whether to be vaccinated (62.5% vs. 49.0%), and significantly fewer stated that they would not be vaccinated (16.7% vs. 25.1%). When the vaccines became available in Serbia, among IgG-negative HCWs, those who stated clear positive (yes) and clear negative (no) attitude toward vaccination before the immunization period had begun were vaccinated at 28% and 20%, respectively, while 51% of unsure HCWs received a vaccine (p = 0.006). Among IgG-positive HCWs, there was no statistical difference in vaccine uptake regarding those with previous negative, positive, and unsure opinions about vaccination (p = 0.498).

Although many children can be observed until spontaneous remission, others require treatment due to bleeding or impact on health-related quality of life. Standard first-line therapies for those who need intervention include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and anti-D globulin, though response to these agents may be only transient. Eltrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for children with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or splenectomy. This protocol paper describes an ongoing open-label, randomised trial comparing eltrombopag to standard first-line management in children with newly diagnosed ITP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomised treatment assignment is 2:1 for eltrombopag versus standard first-line management and is stratified by age and by prior treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is platelet response, defined as 3 of 4 weeks with platelets >5010(9)/L during weeks 6C12 of therapy.

UPSIDES (Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering mental health Services) is a six-country consortium carrying out implementation research on peer support for people with severe mental health conditions in high- (Germany, Israel), lower middle- (India) and low-income (Tanzania, Uganda) settings. This commentary briefly outlines some of the key challenges faced by UPSIDES sites in low- and middle-income countries as a result of Covid-19, sharing early lessons that may also apply to other services seeking to address the needs of people with severe mental health conditions in similar contexts. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED: The key take-away from experiences in India, Tanzania and Uganda is that inequalities in terms of access to mobile technologies, as well as to secure employment and benefits, put peer support workers in particularly vulnerable situations precisely when they and their peers are also at their most isolated. Establishing more resilient peer support services requires attention to the already precarious situation of people with severe mental health conditions in low-resource settings, even before a crisis like Covid-19 occurs. While it is essential to maintain contact with peer support workers and peers to whatever extent is possible remotely, alternatives to face-to-face delivery of psychosocial interventions are not always straightforward to implement and can make it more difficult to observe individuals' reactions, talk about emotional issues and offer appropriate support. CONCLUSIONS: In environments where mental health care was already heavily medicalized and mostly limited to medications issued by psychiatric institutions, Covid-19 threatens burgeoning efforts to pursue a more holistic and person-centered model of care for people with severe mental health conditions. As countries emerge from lockdown, those working in global mental health will need to redouble their efforts not only to make up for lost time and help individuals cope with the added stressors of Covid-19 in their communities, but also to regain lost ground in mental health care reform and in broader conversations about mental health in low-resource settings.","output":"Challenges to peer support in low- and middle-income countries during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As per data available on WHO website, COVID-19 patients on 20 June 2020 have surpassed the figure of 8.7 million globally and around 4.6 lakhs have lost their life.

To generate diversified priority sets, a bi-objective MINLP problem is solved using a GA, and multiple alternatives can be selected based on these priority sets. The proposed approach has been applied to the real case of choosing diversified alternative suppliers amid the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effectiveness. Several existing methods were also applied to this case for comparison. Experimental results showed that only the proposed approach was able to diversify the recommended alternative suppliers that were simultaneously optimal, thereby enhancing decision-making flexibility.

It is expected to become dominant in the coming weeks2, probably due to enhanced transmissibility. A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings from our study. We found B.1.1.529 to be markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from convalescent patients, but also from individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies to all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones currently authorized or approved for use in patients. In addition, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S, and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance to B.1.1.529.

Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity. We assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial in adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to 400 mg sofosbuvir, 60 mg daclatasvir and 1200 mg ribavirin (intervention group) or to standard care (control group). The primary endpoint of this study was length of hospital stay. This study is registered by IRCT.ir under the ID: IRCT20200328046886N1. RESULTS: Between 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 48 patients were recruited; 24 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 24 to the control group. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days in both groups (P = 0.398). The number of ICU admissions in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group was not significantly lower than the control group (0 versus 4, P = 0.109). There was no difference in the number of deaths between the groups (0 versus 3, P = 0.234). The cumulative incidence of recovery was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm (Gray's P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: This randomized trial was too small to make definitive conclusions. There were trends in favour of the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm for recovery and lower death rates. However, there was an imbalance in the baseline characteristics between the arms.

To schematize the current SARS-CoV-2 migration scenario between and within the three countries chosen, using the multitype bearth-death model implemented in BEAST2. Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rate of evolution of 2.11  10-3 per sites per year (95% highest posterior density: 1.56  10-3 to 3.89  10-3 ), and a geographic origin in Shanghai, where time until the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) emerged, according to the analysis of the molecular clock, around 13 November 2019.

That explains also this very short period of subepidermal circulation before the recent events. A total of 8 (median) migration events occurred during this short period, the largest proportion of which (6 events [75%]) occurred from Shanghai (China) to Spain and from Italy to Spain. Such events are marked by speeds of migration that are comparatively lower as compared with that from Shanghai to Italy. Shanghai's R0 and Italy's are closer to each other, though Spain's is slightly higher.

Patients and methods. A cross-sectional study of patients with IRD, who were admitted to V.A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology for inpatient or outpatient treatment. All patients received at least 1 dose of vaccine against COVID-19 (main group). The control group consisted of vaccinated persons without IRD. All participants were interviewed by the researcher by filling out a unified questionnaire, additional information was obtained from medical records. Results and discussion. The study included 204 patients with IRD (151 of them were vaccinated with Sputnik V, 31 with Sputnik Light, 19 with oviVac, 3 with EpiVacCorona;173 patients received the second component of vaccine) and 131 subjects without IRD (101 of them were vaccinated with Sputnik V, 17 C CoviVak, 5 C Sputnik Light, 2 C EpiVacCorona, 6 C Pfizer/BioNTech;124 patients received the second component of the vaccine). The number of patients with IRD who had both local and systemic reactions after administration of the first component of the vaccine was significantly less than in the control group (19.6 and 38.9%, respectively;p<0.001). Similar differences were noted after the administration of the second component (15.6 and 27.4%, respectively;p=0.013). Adverse events (AEs) such as pain at the injection site without restriction of movement, weakness, fever, arthralgia/myalgia and chills were significantly more common in the control group after the administration of the first component of the vaccine. After complete immunization, AEs were absent in 35.8% of patients with IRD and in 21% of controls (p=0.006). Exacerbations of IRD and new autoimmune phenomena were not registered in any case. Conclusion. According to preliminary data, vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with IRD appears to be quite safe.

It is common in Westernized regions and is increasing in incidence in developing countries. At a molecular level, intrinsic deficiencies in epithelial integrity, mucosal barrier function, and mechanisms of immune response and resolution contribute to the development of IBD. Traditionally two platforms have been utilized for disease modeling of IBD; in-vitro monolayer cell culture and in-vivo animal models. Both models have limitations, including cost, lack of representative cell types, lack of complexity of cellular interactions in a living organism, and xenogeneity. Organoids, three-dimensional cellular structures which recapitulate the basic architecture and functional processes of the organ of origin, hold potential as a third platform with which to investigate the pathogenesis and molecular defects which give rise to IBD. Organoids retain the genetic and transcriptomic profile of the tissue of origin over time and unlike monolayer cell culture can be induced to differentiate into most adult intestinal cell types. They may be used to model intestinal host-microbe interactions occurring at the mucosal barrier, are amenable to genetic manipulation and can be co-cultured with other cell lines of interest. Bioengineering approaches may be applied to render a more faithful representation of the intestinal epithelial niche. In this review, we outline the concept of intestinal organoids, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the platform comparative to alternative models, and describe the translational applications of organoids in IBD.","output":"The Role of Organoids as a Novel Platform for Modeling of Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets multiple organs and causes severe coagulopathy. Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. Methods: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. Findings: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41-78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5-44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5-44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5-44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. Interpretation: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: Community cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: N=3097 adults aged &#8805;18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety and stress scores. RESULTS: Mean scores for depression ([Formula: see text] =7.69, SD=6.0), stress ([Formula: see text] =6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety ([Formula: see text] = 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p<0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%-14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%-57% of total variance. CONCLUSIONS: Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups.

Genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 may attribute inter-species transmission and adaptation to a novel host, and therefore is imperative to explicate the evolutionary dynamics of the viral genome and its propensity for differential host selection. We conducted an in silico analysis of all the coding gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n = 39) originating from a range of non-human mammalian species, including pangolin, bat, dog, cat, tiger, mink, mouse, and the environmental samples such as wastewater, air and surface samples from the door handle and seafood market.

A lack of obvious differences as well as a maximum genetic homology among dog-, cat-, tiger-, mink-, mouse-, bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences suggested a likely evolution of these strains from a common ancestor. Several residue substitutions were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, concluding a promiscuous nature of the virus for host species where genomic alternations may be required for the adaptation to novel host/s.

Pediatricians should consider the impact of stress on children, especially from social and intrafamilial isolation, both during and after the pandemic.","output":"Case Report: COVID-19 Pandemic Exacerbates Eating Disorder by Social and Intrafamilial Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in workers of a hospital located in one of the most affected areas in Spain DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study performed between March and May 2020 over all workers of a secondary hospital in Madrid, Spain METHODS: We employed as diagnostic tests PCR (for symptomatic individuals) and serology (for both PCR-negative symptomatic workers and asymptomatic workers) We analyzed the prevalence in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (nHCW) Information about the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and possible contacts prior to infection was collected RESULTS: A total of 2963 workers were included: 1092 were symptomatic, of whom 539 were positive by PCR (49 4% of symptomatic workers) From the remaining symptomatic workers, 197 (35 6%) were positive by serology Regarding asymptomatic workers, 345 were positive by serology (31 9% of infected workers) In total, 1081 (36 5%) presented a positive diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection rates were different between HCW (37 4%) and nHCW (29 8%) (p=0 006) In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of PPE (protective, OR=0 56;95%CI: 0 44-0 72;p&lt;0 001) and previous contact with COVID-19 patients (risk factor, OR=1 69;95%CI: 1 28-2 24;p&lt;0 001) were independent factors that were associated with SAS-CoV-2 infection CONCLUSIONS: More than 36% of our workers became infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the rate of asymptomatic infections accounted for almost 32% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections There were differences in the rates of infection between HCW and nHCW The use of PPE and previous contact with COVID-19 patients were associated with infection","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers of one of the most severely affected institutions in Madrid, Spain: a surveillance cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major challenge for health services worldwide is in providing adequate medical care during mass disasters. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights this difficulty. Patient surge, a consequence of most types of disasters that contribute to trauma experiences, is a primary factor in disrupting such care as it is composed of worried well persons and those experiencing psychosocial trauma that can severely disrupt and overwhelm effective acute hospital based health care. We review the literature and propose a potential solution framework to reduce such a surge that relies on exploiting community social networks as first responders. We utilize and integrate literature based evidence on patient surge, community disaster behaviors and community based informal social networks to examine reasons for patient surge to hospitals. We then propose that leveraging community based social networks as a potent deterrent for non-critically injured, especially those who have experienced psychosocial trauma or the worried well, from seeking hospital care during ongoing disasters. By emphasizing the social capital inherent in community based social networks, this perspective posits an alternative cost-effective means of reducing patient surge.","output":"Reducing patient surge: community based social networks as first responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Annually, there are 3.7 billion downloads of mobile health apps.

During the outbreak of COVID-19, mental health of the general population in Hubei province may be affected. This study aimed to assess the psychological status and associated risk factors of the general population in Hubei province during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was used to evaluate the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, which were assessed by the Chinese version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, respectively. Coping style was assessed by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to detect factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: Among 9,225 participants, 44.5% rated symptoms of PTSD, and 17.9 and 12.7% suffered from moderate and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Individuals who were geographically located in Wuhan and familiar with someone who has COVID-19 had more severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as a higher score in passive coping style (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that people who were geographically located in Wuhan [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-1.36, P < 0.001] were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD. Besides, individuals who were familiar with someone who had COVID-19 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 2.07-2.63, P < 0.001; OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.66-2.17, P < 0.001; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.78-2.39, P < 0.001) and had a higher score in passive coping style (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.14-1.17, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15-1.19, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15-1.19, P < 0.001) were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, a higher score in active coping style (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95-0.97, P < 0.001; OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.93-0.94, P < 0.001; OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94-0.96, P < 0.001) was associated with a lower risk of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions: During the midphase of COVID-19 outbreak, quite a few people have mental health problems; nearly half of the respondents rated symptoms of PTSD, and approximately one-fifth reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our findings may lead to better comprehend the psychological status of the general public and alleviate the public mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The Psychological Status of General Population in Hubei Province During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to measure the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on acceptance of flu vaccination in the 2020-21 season, including for those newly eligible for the UK National Health Service (NHS) free vaccination programme, extended this year to include an estimated 32.4 million (48.8%) of the UK population. Knowing intended uptake is essential to inform supply and steer public health messaging to maximise vaccination given the combined threats of both flu and Covid-19 -- the unknown impact of which on both attitudes and the need for mass uptake yet again create the threat of ill-informed planning resulting in failure to meet necessary public health demand. MethodsAn online questionnaire posing question items on influenza vaccination was administered to registrants of the Care Information Exchange (CIE), the NHSs largest patient electronic personal health record. This was part of a longitudinal study initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. This analysis was limited to those who, in line with established NHS criteria, were previously or newly eligible but had not routinely received seasonal influenza vaccination in the past. Groups were stratified by response (yes/no) to intending to receive flu vaccination in 2020-21: Group 1.) Previously eligible now responding yes, 2.) Previously eligible still responding no, 3.) Newly eligible responding yes, and 4.) Newly eligible responding no. Within these groups, response by health worker status and each groups inclination to vaccinate school age children was also measured. Summary statistics were reported alongside univariate and multivariable regression. Lastly, a network analysis visualised the frequency and co-occurrence of reasons qualifying response for or against influenza vaccination in 2020/21. FindingsAmong 6,641 respondents, 4,040 (61.1%) had previously routinely received the flu vaccination. 1,624 (24.5%) had been either previously eligible but not vaccinated (945, 58.2%) or newly eligible (679, 41.8%). Among the previously eligible participants who had not routinely received influenza vaccination 536 (56.7%) responded they would in 2020-21, increasing the vaccination rate in the entire previously eligible cohort from 79.6% to 91.2%, and 466 (68.6%) in the newly eligible. Multivariable logistic regression resulted in few substantial changes to effect estimates, with the exception of age, for which all estimates showed a stronger association with intention to receive the flu vaccine. In those who became newly eligible to receive the flu vaccine, there was an association between intention to receive the flu vaccine and increased age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12), IMD quintile, and considering oneself at high risk from Covid-19 (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.70). Network analysis showed the most frequent themes for previously eligible unvaccinated and newly eligible participants accepting vaccination in 2020/21 were: precaution for myself (41.2% and 46.1%) and Covid-19 (27.4% and 27.1%), where the former was qualified by the latter in 36% and 29.1% of responses. Among the previously and newly eligible not intending to receive vaccination in 2020/21, misinformed themes of makes me unwell, gives me flu and vaccine doesnt work were present across 37.4% and 21.9% of responses, respectively. Among participants with school age children, of those previously eligible who now intend to be vaccinated themselves, 82.5% also intend to vaccinate their children in 2020/21 compared to 25.8% of those who would not accept the influenza vaccine for themselves. Among the newly eligible respondents this was 82.1% and 43.5%, respectively. 49.9% of the previously unvaccinated healthcare workers would continue to decline the vaccine in 2020/21. InterpretationIn this UK-wide observational study, Covid-19 has increased acceptance of flu vaccination in 2020/21 from 79.6% to 91.2% in those previously eligible, and for the 69% of those newly eligible. This high anticipated vaccination rate (to 26 million (80%) of the UK population) requires appropriate planning, but can be further increased with effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions about flu vaccination, which may also help in preparation for future Covid-19 vaccination. It remains of concern that 50% of healthcare professionals who refused it previously still do not intend to have the flu vaccine.","output":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: A UK-Wide Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a long time, Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) was thought to be a commensal strain in human and animal digestive tracts.

The amount of fermented food consumption was calculated with the use of seven-day dietary records, while depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the use of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. In psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress (n = 372), higher fermented food consumption was associated with more depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, psychiatrically ill medical students (n = 25, 6.3% of all the participants) were found to present a negative association between the amount of fermented food consumed and the severity of depressive symptoms (adjusted  ?0.52, 95% CI ?0.85 to ?0.19, p = 0.0042); however, this relationship was insignificant for anxiety symptoms (adjusted  ?0.22, 95% CI ?0.59 to 0.15, p = 0.22).

The pathogen causing COVID-19 is acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the key entry factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Recognizing the importance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed and presented the landscape of cell-type identities for ACE2+ TMPRSS2+ cells across different human tissues and the age-related alterations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression across different cell types. Additionally, most of the post-acute COVID-19 sequelae could attribute to the ACE2-expressing organ systems. Therefore, these SARS-CoV-2 tropism data should be an essential resource for guiding clinical treatment and pathological studies, which should draw attention toward the prioritization of COVID-19 research in the future. Notably, we discovered the age-related expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the immune-inflammatory stromal cells, implying the potential interplay between COVID-19, stromal cells, and aging. In this study, we developed a novel and practical analysis framework for mapping the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2. This approach was built to aid the identification of viral-specific cell types and age-related alterations of viral tropism, highlighting the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to address viral pathogenesis systematically. With the rapid accumulation of scRNA-seq data and the continuously increasing insight into viral entry factors, we anticipate that this scRNA-seq-based approach will attract broader interest in the virus research communities.

METHODS Sixty junior surgery residents were assigned to the Penn Surgical Simulation and Skills Rotation. The National Surgical Skills Curriculum was implemented using multiple educational tools under faculty supervision. Pretraining and posttraining assessments of technical skills were conducted using validated instruments. Trainee and faculty feedbacks were collected using a structured feedback form. RESULTS Significant global performance improvement was demonstrated using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills score for basic surgical skills (knot tying, wound closure, enterotomy closure, and vascular anastomosis) and Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery skills, P < 0.001. Six trainees were retested on an average of 13.5 months later (range, 8-16 months) and retained more than 75% of their basic surgical skills.

As a large number of nucleotide fragments may be cloned into the phage genome, a phage library may harbour millions or sometimes billions of unique and distinctive displayed peptide ligands. The ligand-receptor interactions forming the basis of phage display have been well utilized in epitope mapping and antigen presentation on the surface of bacteriophages for screening novel vaccine candidates by using affinity selection-based strategy called biopanning. This versatile technique has been modified tremendously over last three decades, leading to generation of different platforms for combinatorial peptide display. The translation of new diagnostic tools thus developed has been used in situations arising due to pathogenic microbes, including bacteria and deadly viruses, such as Zika, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, Hanta, MERS and SARS. In the current situation of pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a search for neutralizing antibodies is motivating the researchers to find therapeutic candidates against novel SARS-CoV-2.

However, interventions developed to expand MOUD access have limited ability to engage opioid users at higher levels of overdose risk, such as those who inject opioids. This paper describes the study protocol for testing STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication-assisted Intervention through NAvigation), an intervention that engages high-risk opioid users at community-based syringe service programs (SSP) and quickly links them to MOUD using a telemedicine platform. METHODS: This randomized control trial will be conducted at three SSP sites in Chicago. All participants will complete an initial assessment with a provider from a Federally Qualified Health Center who can prescribe or refer MOUD services as appropriate. The control arm will receive standard referral to treatment and the intervention arm will receive immediate telemedicine linkage to the provider and (depending on the type of MOUD prescribed) provided transportation to pick up their induction prescription (for buprenorphine or naltrexone) or attend their intake appointment (for methadone). We aim to recruit a total of 273 participants over two years to provide enough power to detect a difference in our primary outcome of MOUD treatment linkage. Secondary outcomes include treatment engagement, treatment retention, and non-MOUD opioid use. Data will be collected using structured interviews and saliva drug tests delivered at baseline, three months, and six months. Fixed and mixed effects generalized linear regression analyses and survival analysis will be conducted to compare the probabilities of a successful treatment linkage between the two arms, days retained in treatment, and post-baseline opioid and other drug use. DISCUSSION: If successful, STAMINA's telemedicine approach will significantly reduce the amount of time between SSP clients' initial indication of interest in the medication and treatment initiation. Facilitating this process will likely lead to stronger additional treatment- and recovery-oriented outcomes. This study is also timely given the need for more rigorous testing of telemedicine interventions in light of temporary regulatory changes that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BNT162b2 is approved for the vaccination of adolescents over 16 years of age. Systemic adverse events were scarce though the pretested cohort of this age group was relatively small. The aim of the current study is to raise awareness for potential adverse reactions. METHODS: This is a case series of patients diagnosed with perimyocarditis following vaccination. Patients were compiled from 3 pediatric medical centers in Israel through a network of pediatricians and data regarding those cases was collected. In addition, incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was compared with previous years. RESULTS: All patients were males 16C18 years old, of Jewish descent, who presented with chest pain that began 1C3 days following vaccination (mean, 2.1 days). In 6 of the 7 patients, symptoms began following the 2nd dose and in 1 patient following the 1st dose. All cases were mild and none required cardiovascular or respiratory support. The incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was elevated in comparison to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes a time association between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and perimyocarditis in adolescents. All cases were mild, although only long-term follow-up can reveal the true impact of this cardiac injury. While it seems that the incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination campaign period is increased, a more comprehensive data collection on a wider scale should be done.

It has been suggested that many patients with positive RT-PCR 'missed' by antigen testing might be non-infectious. METHODS: In a real-world high-throughput setting for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, 494 patients were tested using RT-PCR as well as a single lateral flow antigen test (Ecotest, AssureTech, China). Where the results differed, virus viability was evaluated by cell culture. The test parameters were calculated with RT-PCR and RT-PCR adjusted on viability as reference standards. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the used antigen test related to the RT-PCR only was 76.2%, specificity was 97.3%. However, 36 out of 39 patients 'missed' by the antigen test contained no viable virus. After adjusting on that, the sensitivity grew to 97.7% and, more importantly for disease control purposes, the negative predictive value reached 99.2%. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that viability testing should be always performed when evaluating a new antigen test.

This study reports the results from 839 HCWs, mostly employees of primary care centers, sampled in June 2020. Prior infection, as measured using seropositivity, was found among 12% (100/839) of HCWs, ranging from 0C29% between care units. There was a significant trend of decreasing serology positivity by age (one sided p-trend 0.0467). Seropositivity was highest among HCWs < 40 years of age. Within this age group there was 19% (23/120) seropositivity among women and 11% (15/38) among men (p < 0.02). Current infection, as measured using PCR, was found in only 1% and the typical pre-symptomatic testing pattern found in only 2 subjects. SARS-CoV-2 infections had been rather common among younger HCWs in this setting, but pre-symptomatic infection appeared to be uncommon.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients.

For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA. SETTING Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises. MAIN OUTCOME The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

In the first scenario, cardiotoxic cancer treatment and COVID-19 synergize to exacerbate direct myocardial damage. In the second scenario, cardiotoxic cancer treatment leads to a reduced cardiac reserve in cancer survivors, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19 in a two-hit model. The third scenario suggests that several shared risk factors may aggravate cardiovascular complications caused by both cancer treatment and COVID-19.

While ECMO has proven valuable in the treatment of acute lung failure, little is known about when and how it should be used to support critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS We performed an international email survey to assess how ECMO providers worldwide have previously used ECMO during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Questions targeted indications to begin ECMO, technical specifications, anticoagulation strategy and reasons for treatment discontinuation. RESULTS 276 centers worldwide responded that they employed ECMO for very severe COVID-19 cases, mostly in veno-venous configuration (87%). The most common reason to establish ECMO was isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure (50%), followed by a combination of hypoxemia and hypercapnia (39%). Only a small fraction of patients required veno-arterial cannulation due to heart failure (3%). Time on ECMO varied between less than two and more than four weeks. The main reason to discontinue ECMO treatment prior to patient's recovery was lack of clinical improvement (53%), followed by major bleeding, mostly intracranially (13%). Only 4% of respondents reported that triage situations, lack of staff or lack of oxygenators were responsible for the discontinuation of ECMO support. Most ECMO physicians (66%  26%) agreed that patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS benefitted from ECMO. Overall mortality of COVID-19 patients on ECMO was estimated to be about 55%, scoring higher than what has previously been reported for Influenza patients on ECMO (29-36%). Most ECMO providers agreed that, while COVID-19 patients were longer on ECMO compared to patients with ARDS of different origin, supposed hypercoagulation was hardly an issue during ECMO therapy and oxygenator change was not required more frequently than they were used to. CONCLUSION ECMO has been utilized successfully during the COVID-19 pandemic to stabilize CARDS patients in hypoxemic or hypercapnic lung failure, despite initial recommendations from scientific societies were mostly reluctant. Age and multimorbidity limited the use of ECMO. Triage situations were rarely a concern. ECMO providers stated that patients with severe COVID-19 benefitted from ECMO. An increasing use in patients with respiratory failure in a future stage of the pandemic may be expected. Early apprehensions that COVID-19 related hypercoagulation would result in severe thromboembolic complications during extracorporeal circulation were mostly mitigated judging from survey experience.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome-a Euroelso international survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been growing recognition of risks to frontline health care workers.

Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.

To investigate effects of COVID-related stress on food motivation, we recruited adults (N=429; 272 F, 157 M) to complete an online survey via Amazon MTurk in May 2020. Current COVID-related stress, retrospective pre-COVID stress, and motivation in relation to individualized preferred foods from five categories (sweet snacks, fruit, savory snacks, vegetables, and fast food) were assessed. Food motivation measures included willingness to wait, willingness to expend low effort [finger taps], willingness to expend high effort [jumping jacks], and willingness to pay for hypothetical delivery of the food item. Food motivation for each food type was assessed using a novel instrument designed for brief assessment of multiple aspects of food motivation across multiple food types. Participants were willing to pay the most for fast food followed by sweet snacks, and willing to wait longer for sweet snacks relative to other food types. While fast food and sweets also generated the most willingness to expend high and low effort, willingness to expend low effort for fruit was similar to that for fast food and sweets, and willingness to expend high effort for fruit was comparable to that for fast food.

Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins have been putatively associated with these dysfunctions. In this work, we analyzed the recruitment of hemoglobin (Hb) and other metabolites (hemin and protoporphyrin IX-PpIX) by SARS-Cov2 proteins using different approaches. (2) Methods: shotgun proteomics (LCCMS/MS) after affinity column adsorption identified hemin-binding SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The parallel synthesis of the peptides technique was used to study the interaction of the receptor bind domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein with Hb and in silico analysis to identify the binding motifs of the N protein. The plaque assay was used to investigate the inhibitory effect of Hb and the metabolites hemin and PpIX on virus adsorption and replication in Vero cells. (3) Results: the proteomic analysis by LCCMS/MS identified the S, N, M, Nsp3, and Nsp7 as putative hemin-binding proteins. Six short sequences in the RBD and 11 in the NTD of the spike were identified by microarray of peptides to interact with Hb and tree motifs in the N protein by in silico analysis to bind with heme. An inhibitory effect in vitro of Hb, hemin, and PpIX at different levels was observed. Strikingly, free Hb at 1mM suppressed viral replication (99%), and its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 was localized into the RBD region of the spike protein. (4) Conclusions: in this study, we identified that (at least) five proteins (S, N, M, Nsp3, and Nsp7) of SARS-CoV-2 recruit Hb/metabolites. The motifs of the RDB of SARS-CoV-2 spike, which binds Hb, and the sites of the heme bind-N protein were disclosed. In addition, these compounds and PpIX block the viruss adsorption and replication. Furthermore, we also identified heme-binding motifs and interaction with hemin in N protein and other structural (S and M) and non-structural (Nsp3 and Nsp7) proteins.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Bind to Hemoglobin and Its Metabolites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Symptoms associated with lung cancer and thoracic surgery might increase fall risk. We aimed to investigate: 1) balance, gait and functional status in people post-thoracic surgery compared to healthy controls; 2) perceptions of balance, gait and functional status. METHODS: Recruitment targeted older adults (50 years) who had undergone thoracic surgery for a diagnosis of lung cancer in the previous 3 months, and healthy age-matched controls. Dynamic and static balance, gait velocity, knee-extension strength and physical activity levels were assessed using the BESTest, Kistler force plate, GAITRite system, Biodex System 3 and CHAMPS questionnaire, respectively. Two-part semi-structured interviews were conducted post-surgery. RESULTS: Individuals post-surgery (n = 15) had worse dynamic balance and gait, and lower levels of moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (all p<0.05) versus healthy controls (n = 15). Strength did not differ between groups (p > 0.05). No associations between BESTest and strength or physical activity existed post-surgery (p > 0.05). Three themes were identified: 1) Symptoms affect daily activities; 2) Functional assessments alter perceptions of balance ability and 3) Open to supervised rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Balance, gait and MVPA are impaired post-thoracic surgery, yet balance was not viewed to be important in enabling activities of daily living. However, supervised rehabilitation was considered acceptable.","output":"Investigating balance, gait, and physical function in people who have undergone thoracic surgery for a diagnosis of lung cancer: A mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and it quickly spread to many countries.

This impact can be reduced by applying a range of evidence-based coping strategies. Based on previous research, we created a pamphlet-based communication campaign designed to assist adults to provide support for young people confronted with emotional distress associated with the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] and the related disease [coronavirus disease (COVID-19)] in 2020. We developed a pamphlet describing the common emotions children and adolescents report feeling in the face of disasters and the coping strategies that have proven effective in mitigating them. The target population was adults who interact with children and adolescents in both formal and informal settings. The pamphlet included basic information on this specific emergency, emotions that might be commonly experienced, and coping strategies for dealing with negative emotions. The aim of this paper is to describe the planning, development, and implementation of the campaign. First, we monitored how the media gave visibility to the campaign during the 40 days following the release of the pamphlet: it potentially reached a large audience at a national and international level through at least 216 media channels included the HEMOT(?) (Helmet for EMOTions) website. Second, Google Analytics? data from the HEMOT(?) website enabled us to examine the characteristics of the visitors to the website and the behavior of those who viewed the pamphlet. More than 6,000 visitors, most from Europe followed by the Americas, visited the website in the first 40 days after the pamphlet publication. The webpage including the pamphlet obtained over 6,200 views, most directly or via other websites. A cluster analysis suggested that the access to the webpage did not mirror the trend concerning the new cases of COVID-19 in Italy (which increased during the central phase of the campaign) or worldwide (which continued to increase across the 40 days). Third, data gathered with a convenience sample of adults who had consulted the pamphlet provided a perspective on the comprehensibility of the messages conveyed by the pamphlet and on the utility for children and adolescents. The process we have demonstrated in this example could be replicated in different communities and settings to respond to the spread of the COVID-19 or to respond to other widespread or more localized disasters.","output":"Development and Early Implementation of a Public Communication Campaign to Help Adults to Support Children and Adolescents to Cope With Coronavirus-Related Emotions: A Community Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concern has arisen about the role played in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

A self-administered survey questionnaire consisting of 26 questions about current hypertension treatment with ACE-i/ ARBs was applied to cardiologists, internists, and family physicians in central and western Turkey, between 01 and 19 May 2020. A total of 460 physicians were approached, and 220 (47.8%) participated in the study. Of the total respondents, 78.7% reported that they had not changed their antihypertensive medication prescribing pattern, 8.6% of clinicians had changed ACE-i/ ARBs medicine of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and 12.7% of them were undecided. The median (interquartile range) score indicating general reliance level of physicians in ACE-i/ARBs therapy was 8  4 (range, 1C10).

Hundreds of enzymes participate in reversible ubiquitylation of proteins, some acting globally and others targeting specific proteins. Ubiquitylation is essential for innate immune responses, as it facilitates rapid regulation of inflammatory pathways, thereby ensuring sufficient but not excessive responses. A growing number of inborn errors of immunity are attributed to dysregulated ubiquitylation. These genetic disorders exhibit broad clinical manifestations, ranging from susceptibility to infection to autoinflammatory and/or autoimmune features, lymphoproliferation and propensity to malignancy. Many autoinflammatory disorders result from disruption of components of the ubiquitylation machinery and lead to overactivation of innate immune cells.

The AirAnswers(R) device uses electro-kinetic flow to sample air at high rates and capture bio-aerosols on grounded electrodes in assayable form. Cartridges were removed from the devices and immediately conveyed to the Inspirotec facility in North Chicago, where assays were performed. Biomarkers determined were for allergens and molds previously described for this system. Testing for a new marker, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was also included. The method was validated by determination of capture efficiency with reference to an impinger sampler in a Class III controlled environment chamber. Average capture efficiency for triplicate runs was 14%. One SARS-CoV-2 positive sample as found at the registration area, which was physically separate from the main exhibit area.

This meant massive restraints for the population. Objectives: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? Methods: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individuals intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1C7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. Results: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p &lt; 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (?R 2 = 0.002). Discussion: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS A multicentre, randomised, pragmatic feasibility study. From the general CT-attending population, women aged 65 years and men aged 75 years attending for CT scans are invited to participate, via a novel consent form incorporating Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) questions. Those at increased 10-year risk (within the amber or red zones of the UK FRAX graphical outputs for further action) are block randomised (1:1:1) to (1) PHOENIX intervention, (2) active control or (3) usual care. The PHOENIX intervention comprises (i) retrieving the CT scans using the NHS Image Exchange Portal, (ii) Mindways QCT Pro software analysis of CT hip and spine none density with CT vertebral fracture assessment, (iii) sending the participants' general practitioner (GP) a clinical report including diagnosis, necessary investigations and recommended treatment. Baseline CT scans from groups 2 and 3 are assessed with the PHOENIX intervention only at study end. Assuming 25% attrition, the study is powered to find a predicted superior osteoporosis treatment rate with PHOENIX (20%) vs 16% among patients whose GPs were sent the FRAX questionnaire only (active control) and 5% in the usual care group. Five hospitals are participating to determine feasibility. The co-primary feasibility outcome measures are (a) ability to randomise 375 patients within 10 months and (b) retention of 75% of survivors, completing their 1-year bone health outcome questionnaire.

There was male preponderance. There were 14 patients with infectious CNS-disease (meningitis (n = 1), encephalitis (n = 5), meningo-encephalitis (n = 5), myelitis (n = 3)), and 34 patients with parainfectious CNS-disease (encephalopathy (n = 18), autoimmune encephalitis (n = 11), acute, disseminated, encephalo-myelitis (n = 3), acute, haemorrhagic, necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 2)). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 40 patients and was positive for the virus in 4 patients with infectious CNS-disease but was negative for the virus in all patients with parainfectious CNS-disease.

The UK Defence Medical Services recognised the need to provide an evidence-based programme of care intended to support personnel transitioning from assisting the national response back to normal duties. This was informed by a narrative review that targeted literature exploring strategies for supporting the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during 21st-century infectious disease outbreaks.

While this field has typically focused on fully harvesting the signal provided by a single (and generally extremely reliable) modality, fewer efforts have utilized imprecise data lacking reliable ground truth labels. In this unsupervised, noisy setting, the robustification and quantification of the diagnosis uncertainty become paramount, thus posing a new challenge: how can we combine multiple sources of information -- often themselves with vastly varying levels of precision and uncertainty -- to provide a diagnosis estimate with confidence bounds? Motivated by a concrete application in antibody testing, we devise a Stochastic Expectation-Maximization algorithm that allows the principled integration of heterogeneous, and potentially unreliable, data types. Our Bayesian formalism is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources and their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of confidence associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing values that typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this approach on simulated data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a real COVID-19 immunity study.","output":"A Bayesian Hierarchical Network for Combining Heterogeneous Data Sources in Medical Diagnoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The quality of resuscitation for out hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during the COVID-19 era could be affected. We aim to describe prehospital healthcare providers resuscitative efforts for OHCA cases and their definitive outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included all OHCA cases between April and June 2021 across all regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Demographic variables, response times, CPR providers, initial rhythm, use of AED/Defibrillator, medical interventions, ROSC data, and dispatch codes were extracted from a central electronic platform. RESULTS: A total of 1307 OHCA cases were included in this study, males constituted 65% and 42% were 65 years. Although the median response time to initiate CPR was 13 min, 11% of OHCA cases had a response time between 0 and 6 min. About 75% of CPR was provided on scene by BLS units, 78% of OHCA cases had asystole as their initial rhythm, an AED/Defibrillator was used more than 90% of the time for pulseless VT/VF rhythm, and ROSC was achieved in 8% of OHCA patients. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining resuscitative efforts for OHCA continues in KSA. Closing knowledge gaps in the community and a better description of OHCA for the dispatcher could guide dispatch-assisted CPR and minimize OHCA response times.","output":"Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Saudi Red Crescent Experience Throughout COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Otitis media (OM) is one of the most frequent diseases of childhood, with a minority of children suffering from recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) or chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), both of which are associated with significant morbidity. We investigated whether the microbiological profiling could be used to differentiate between these two conditions. METHODS: Children up to five years of age, with rAOM (n = 45) or COME (n = 129) and scheduled for tympanostomy tube insertion were enrolled in a prospective study between 2008 and 2009. Middle ear fluids (n = 119) and nasopharyngeal samples (n = 173) were collected during surgery for bacterial culture and PCR analysis to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and to detect 15 distinct respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in middle ear fluids did not significantly differ between patients suffering from rAOM and COME. In both patient cohorts, H. influenzae and rhinovirus were the predominant pathogens in the middle ear and nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carriage with two or three bacterial pathogens was associated with the presence of bacteria in middle ear fluid (P = 0.04). The great majority of the bacteria isolated from middle ear fluid were genetically identical to nasopharyngeal isolates from the same patient. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we propose that the common perception that rAOM is associated with recurrent episodes of microbiologically mediated AOM, whereas COME is generally a sterile inflammation, should be reconsidered.","output":"Microbial profiling does not differentiate between childhood recurrent acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 may lead to high levels of expression of inflammatory cytokines.

Thus, PQ is frequently found in surface water systems and is potentially toxic to aquatic organisms, since it can cause mitochondrial dysfunction altering in the redox state of cells. This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of PQ to Chironomus riparius and Girardia tigrina, and compare their physiological strategies to cope with environmental stress. The mean emergence time was the most sensitive endpoint for Chironomids, with the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) being 0.02 for males and 0.1 mg PQ L-1 for females. Moreover, PQ reduced the body weight of male and female imagoes, with LOECs of 0.5 and 2.5 mg PQ L-1, respectively. Paraquat also decreased the respiration rate (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) and total glutathione (tGSH) content (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1). Thus, the aerobic production of energy was not affected and allowed chironomids to cope with oxidative stress induced by PQ, but with consequent physiological costs in terms of development rates and weight of adults. In planarians, PQ decreased the locomotion and feeding activity, and delayed photoreceptor regeneration (LOECs = 2.5 mg PQ L-1 for all endpoints). Despite increased aerobic energy production (LOEC = 0.5 mg PQ L-1), planarians were not able to cope with oxidative stress induced by the highest PQ concentrations, since lipid peroxidation levels were significantly increased (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1) concomitantly with a significant decrease of tGSH (LOEC = 2.5 mg PQ L-1).

Predictors of poor outcome collected on hospital admission may inform clinical and public health decisions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort investigation of 297 adults admitted to eight academic and community hospitals in Georgia, United States, during March 2020. Using standardized medical record abstraction, we collected data on predictors including admission demographics, underlying medical conditions, outpatient antihypertensive medications, recorded symptoms, vital signs, radiographic findings, and laboratory values. We used random forest models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS: Compared with age <45 years, ages 65C74 years and 75 years were predictors of IMV (aOR 3.12, CI 1.47C6.60; aOR 2.79, CI 1.23C6.33) and the strongest predictors for death (aOR 12.92, CI 3.26C51.25; aOR 18.06, CI 4.43C73.63).

Meshes were placed in a premuscular position (Lichtenstein's procedure) and in a preperitoneal position. In addition, a reconstruction of the abdominal wall by modified components separation technique was performed. During the early postoperative period no complications were registered. Intensive care treatment was not necessary. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8 in an excellent condition. Six months after surgery a scrotal hematocele was diagnosed and operatively removed. After a follow-up of 1.5 years neither hernia recurrence, nor chronic groin pain were recorded. The patient reported to be sexually active. His quality of life improved notably. Additionally, a Medline and PubMed database research was performed to create an overall picture of the existing surgical treatment strategies.

Like related animal 1CoVs, OC43 uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as receptor determinant. 1CoV receptor binding is typically controlled by attachment/fusion spike protein S and receptor-binding/receptor-destroying hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE. We show that following OC43s introduction into humans, HE-mediated receptor binding was selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of mutations in the HE lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss of HE lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human coronavirus, HKU1. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways.

Recently, new viruses associated with recent outbreaks including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus have been discovered. The imaging findings of these emerging pathogens have been described in a few recent studies. This review focuses on the radiographic and computed tomographic patterns of viral pneumonia caused by different pathogens, including new pathogens. Clinical characteristics that could affect imaging, such as patient age and immune status, seasonal variation and community outbreaks, and pathogenesis, are also discussed. The first goal of this review is to indicate that there are imaging features that should raise the possibility of viral infections. Second, to help radiologists differentiate viral infections, viruses in the same viridae that have similar pathogenesis and can have similar imaging characteristics are shown. By considering both the clinical and radiologic characteristics, radiologists can suggest the diagnosis of viral pneumonia. ?RSNA, 2018.","output":"Radiographic and CT Features of Viral Pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the study is to analyze the situation of Higher Education during the Pandemic Era of COVID-19 in the Philippines from the World perspective.

Popular search engines were used browsing through ScienceDirect, Research Gate, and Web of Science was used to generate the information. This health emergency of COVID-19 raised to a pandemic level had changed and kept on affecting millions of lives of astounding magnitude with multidimensional implications. The pandemic placed the whole world at a standstill, interventions putting countries into a shutdown as most if not all nations leaders chose strict quarantine restrictions to all social and economic activities. Higher education is one social institution affected just the same as others. The safety of students, teachers, and administrators was put at a priority thus forcing the entire educational system into a challenge of continuing the teaching-learning process without compromising the health conditions of everyone involved in the process. Alternatives were identified towards the more impersonal and indirect methodology of continuing the learning process. Online education, distance education, e-learning, and other alternative modes of learning delivery by any means necessary just to be able to continue on with the new normal in the academic institutions. The technology was more than welcome into these alternative models. The internet, social media applications, and even the more traditional television and radio were utilized to supplement the more popular ones. There were also revisions made in the curriculum being implemented to suit the new needs as required by the restrictions and challenges of students and teachers being safely tucked in their home environments. Teachers and learners were also made to adopt the more impersonal means of communicating and connecting making the most of the present strategies to work to their own advantages.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a high-intensity interval training and resistance training (HIIT + RT) program on body composition and intestinal microbiota composition in overweight or obese postmenopausal women. METHODS Participants (n = 17) were randomized in two groups: HIIT + RT group (3  / week, 12 weeks) and control group without any training. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure whole-body and abdominal/visceral FM and fat-free mass. Intestinal microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at baseline and at the study end, and the diet controlled. RESULTS Compared with sedentary controls, physical fitness (Maximal Oxygen Consumption, Peak Power Output) increased, total abdominal and visceral FM decreased, and segmental muscle mass increased in the training group. Although the HIIT + RT protocol did not modify -diversity and taxonomy, it significantly influenced microbiota composition. Moreover, various intestinal microbiota members were correlated with HIIT + RT-induced body composition changes, and baseline microbiota composition predicted the response to the HIIT + RT program. CONCLUSIONS HIIT + RT is an effective modality to reduce abdominal/visceral FM and improve physical capacity in non-dieting overweight or obese postmenopausal women. Training modified intestinal microbiota composition and the response to training seems to depend on the initial microbiota profile. More studies are needed to determine whether microbiota composition could predict the individual training response.","output":"Impact of Concurrent Training on Body Composition and Gut Microbiota in Postmenopausal Women with Overweight or Obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo Nos ltimos anos a Amrica Latina tem experimentado uma reduo importante das coberturas vacinais.

It is difficult to foresee the future length and severity; it may be weeks, months, or even years that could deplete the energy and resources of the health care facilities and the providers as there is marginal to no pharmacological medication available to treat the Covid-19. Unless an effective pharmacological treatment such as medicines and vaccines is developed and released publicly, wearing protective face masks and protecting personal health and hygiene is merely a choice to avoid the Covid-19 spread. This review summarizes the background knowledge on the Covid-19 disease and currently available face masks for highly infectious disease primary prevention. According to recent studies onf Covid-19 prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, nanotechnologists have provided a revolutionary approach that involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological steps, one of which is the use of nanofibers in facemasks and respirators.

At St George's, University of London we developed an interactive online form of decision-based PBL (D-PBL) for our undergraduate medical course using web-based virtual patients (VPs). This method of delivery allowed students to consider options for clinical management, to take decisions and to explore the consequences of their chosen actions. Students had identified this as a more engaging type of learning activity compared to conventional paper-based/linear PBL and demonstrated improved exam performance in controlled trials. We explored the use of Second Life (SL), a virtual world and immersive 3D environment, as a tool to provide greater realism than our interactive image and text-based D-PBL patient cases. Eighteen separate tutorial groups were provided with their own experience of the same patient scenario in separate locations within the virtual world. The study found that whilst a minority of students reported that the Second Life experience felt more realistic, most did not. Students favored the simpler interaction of the web-based VPs, which already provided them with the essential learning needed for practice. This was in part due to the time proximity to exams and the extra effort required to learn the virtual world interface.

Dietary adequacy and quality were evaluated by the Korean Dietary Reference Intake and the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) for adults, respectively, according to three food security levels, i.e., food security, low food security, and very low food security. A total of 7144 Korean adults (aged 19 to 64 years) were selected from cross-sectional data from the 2013C2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The risk of inadequate nutrient intakes of protein (p trend = 0.021) and phosphorus (p trend = 0.002) increased according to food insecurity levels after adjustment for putative risk factors. The total KHEI scores (p < 0.001) as well as scores of having breakfast (p < 0.001) were lowest in the very low food security group. Among KHEI components, adults with food insecurity were less likely to get full scores from intakes of mixed grains (p trend = 0.016), total fruit (p trend = 0.039), fresh fruit (p trend = 0.043), and breakfast (p trend < 0.001). In addition, food-insecure adults were more likely to get zero score from intakes of fresh fruit (p trend = 0.020), milk and dairy products (p trend = 0.049), breakfast (p trend < 0.001), % of energy from sweets and beverages (p trend = 0.002), and total energy (p trend = 0.033). In conclusion, food security levels were associated with how much they ate, as well what they ate, in adults in South Korea. These results implied that the diet adequacy as well as moderation and balance could be carefully treated with food assistance or nutrition intervention once nutritional adequacy has mostly been met.

There is currently no specific agent for treating septic shock. Anisodamine is an agent extracted from traditional Chinese medicine with potent anti-inflammatory effects. However, its clinical effectiveness remains largely unknown. METHODS: In a multicentre, open-label trial, we randomly assigned adults with septic shock to receive either usual care or anisodamine (0.1C0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per hour), with the anisodamine doses adjusted by clinicians in accordance with the patients shock status. The primary end point was death on hospital discharge. The secondary end points were ventilator-free days at 28 days, vasopressor-free days at 28 days, serum lactate and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score from days 0 to 6. The differences in the primary and secondary outcomes were compared between the treatment and usual care groups with the (2) test, Students t test or rank-sum test, as appropriate. The false discovery rate was controlled for multiple testing. RESULTS: Of the 469 patients screened, 355 were assigned to receive the trial drug and were included in the analyses181 patients received anisodamine, and 174 were in the usual care group. We found no difference between the usual care and anisodamine groups in hospital mortality (36% vs. 30%; p = 0.348), or ventilator-free days (median [Q1, Q3], 24.4 [5.9, 28] vs. 26.0 [8.5, 28]; p = 0.411).

Severe forms of COVID-19 appear to be more frequent in obese patients, but an association with metabolic disorders is not established. Here, we focused on lipoprotein metabolism in patients hospitalized for severe pneumonia, depending on COVID-19 status.Methods: Thirty-four non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were enrolled. Most of them required intensive care. Plasma lipid levels, lipoprotein metabolism, and clinical and biological features were assessed.Findings: Despite similar initial metabolic comorbidities and respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients displayed a lower acute phase response with higher plasmatic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). NEFA profiling was characterised by higher level of polyunsaturated NEFAs (mainly linoleic and arachidonic acids) in COVID-19 patients, suggesting an increase in phospholipase A2 activity. Multivariable analysis showed that among severe pneumonia, COVID-19-associated pneumonia was associated with higher NEFAs, lower apolipoprotein E and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, independently of body mass index, sequential organ failure (SOFA) score, and C-reactive protein levels.Trial Registration: NCT04435223Funding Statement: This study was supported by grant (MN) from the COVIDOLIP C AOIc2020 (Institutional grant), by the INSERM (Centre de Recherche UMR 1231) and the ANR Investissements dAvenir Grant (ANR-11 LABX-0021-01, Labex Lipstic).Declaration of Interest: The authors declare no existing conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The study fulfilled legal and ethics requirements: Approval was obtained from the CPP (Comit de Protection des Personnes SUD MEDITERRANEE V;2017-A03404-49) for the original study and an amendment was obtained to include supplementary patients with severe COVID-19.

Information on the incidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) infections in developing countries, especially among rural children, is very limited. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify whether these viruses were associated with ARTI among children 5 years of age in rural and peri-urban populations in South India. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional with prospective sample collection. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children 5 years of age presenting with ARTI. None of the children in this study were known to have any immunosuppressive conditions. The two viruses, hMPV and HBoV, were identified using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and one-step PCR assays, respectively. The lower limits of detection of hMPV and HBoV were 6.69  10(5) plasmid copies and 5.77  10(3) plasmid copies, respectively, per 5 L PCR reaction input. RESULTS: The frequency of hMPV infection in children was higher than that of HBoV infection. The different frequencies of hMPV in patients in various age groups with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were compared, and the variance was found to be insignificant. In the 38 children who were hMPV positive, the majority (73.7 %) were from rural communities. The overall hMPV-positive rate was higher in the rural population than in the peri-urban population, but the difference was statistically insignificant. The youngest age at which hMPV-positive status was recorded was 5 months. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that hMPV was associated with a significant number (i.e. >10 %) of ARTIs in children in South India, whereas a relatively smaller number of HBoV infections was observed.","output":"Molecular Detection of Human Metapneumovirus and Human Bocavirus on Oropharyngeal Swabs Collected from Young Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections from Rural and Peri-Urban Communities in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article briefly describes Egypts acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemic preparedness and containment plan and illustrates the impact of implementation of the plan on combating the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.

The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision support tools or novel research papers to have a critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability versus explainability and global versus local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black box models with explanations, rather than interpretable models.","output":"Opening the black box: the promise and limitations of explainable machine learning in cardiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference methodreferred to as mixture-model approachfor the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the tests ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.","output":"Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) of facet or sacroiliac joints is widely used for the treatment of chronic axial pain and can provide long-term pain relief in well-selected patients. The most common side effect is transient neuropathic pain at the paravertebral level of interest. Pain physicians commonly administer corticosteroid post-neurotomy to reduce the risk of post-neurotomy neuropathic pain, yet it remains unclear if this provides a true reduction in incidence. OBJECTIVES To determine the efficacy of corticosteroid administration post-lesion in preventing the development of post-neurotomy neuropathic pain after cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacroiliac joint radiofrequency denervation. STUDY DESIGN Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind prospective study. SETTING Ambulatory Surgical Center within a Tertiary Hospital System. METHODS This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03247413). Permission to conduct human research was obtained from the Institutional Review Board. Eligible patients included those with cervical, thoracic, or lumbar facet or sacroiliac joint pain who had positive concordant medial branch blocks (thus scheduled for bilateral RFN), at least 18 years of age, and English-speaking. Patients received dexamethasone vs saline (control) at each lesion site, serving as their own control (with laterality). Follow-ups were completed at 4- and 8-weeks post-intervention to evaluate the incidence of post-procedure pain (questionnaire) and function using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) or the Neck Disability Index (NDI). RESULTS At the time of data analysis, 35/63 patients completed the study protocol. There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of post-neurotomy pain in the steroid group vs the control group (20/35 control group vs 3/35 steroid group, P < 0.001). ODI/NDI scores changed differently over time depending on the spinal level of neurotomy, showing statistically significant improvement in ODI/NDI in the cervical subgroup and lumbar subgroup at 4-week (P = 0.05) and 8-week time points (P < 0.01), respectively. There was no improvement of ODI scores in the sacral subgroup. The incidence of post-neurotomy neuropathic pain was not significantly different among patients with different spinal levels of neurotomy. Patients who developed post-neurotomy neuropathic pain did not differ in ODI/NDI scores at any time point. LIMITATIONS This study has several limitations, most notably the number of patients lost to follow-up, the use of a single corticosteroid, and the use of laterality for incidence reporting. Additionally, all procedures were performed by a single interventionalist using one neurotomy system. CONCLUSIONS A statistically significant reduction in post-neurotomy pain was observed in the steroid group. This protocol can be feasibly conducted in an effective and resource-efficient manner. Additional research is needed to increase the power of the study.","output":"Dexamethasone Effectively Reduces the Incidence of Post-neurotomy Neuropathic Pain: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D is known not only for its importance for bone health but also for its biologic activities on many other organ systems. This is due to the presence of the vitamin D receptor in various types of cells and tissues, including the skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endocrine pancreas, immune cells, and blood vessels. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D exerts several actions that are thought to be protective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infectivity and severity. These include the immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, the regulatory effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the kidneys and the lungs, and the protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in protecting against risk of acquiring acute respiratory viral infection and may improve outcomes in sepsis and critically ill patients. There are a growing number of data connecting COVID-19 infectivity and severity with vitamin D status, suggesting a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention or as an adjunctive treatment of COVID-19. Although the results from most ongoing randomized clinical trials aiming to prove the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for these purposes are still pending, there is no downside to increasing vitamin D intake and having sensible sunlight exposure to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at a level of least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and preferably 40 to 60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and its severity.","output":"Vitamin D and Its Potential Benefit for the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote engineering and science laboratories are gaining an increased prominence due to its versatility, ease of use 24/7, most likely open and shared access to any components, setups and instruments, in reconfigurable circuits, and laboratory establishments, including quite unique and expensive ones.

The novel assay failed to cross-react with the other pathogens tested, suggesting it is highly specific for ECoV. Using artificially synthesized ECoV RNA, the 50% detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10(1.8) copies/reaction.

However, the quality of delivery of CPR varies widely in different settings, possibly affecting patient outcomes. This study is aimed to determine the efficacy of an audio-visual (AV) CPR feedback device in improving the quality of CPR delivered by healthcare providers. METHODS This pre-post, single-arm, quasi-experimental study randomly sampled 140 healthcare providers working in the Emergency Department of Hospital Ampang, Malaysia. Parameters of CPR quality, namely chest compression rate and depth were compared among participants when they performed CPR with and without an AV CPR feedback device. The efficacy of the AV CPR feedback device was assessed using the Chi-square test and Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) models. RESULTS The use of an AV CPR feedback device increased the proportion of healthcare providers achieving recommended depth of chest compressions from 38.6% (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI: 30.5, 47.2) to 85.0% (95%CI: 78.0, 90.5). A similar significant improvement from 39.3% (95%CI: 31.1, 47.9) to 86.4% (95%CI: 79.6, 91.6) in the recommended rate of chest compressions was also observed. Use of the AV CPR device significantly increased the likelihood of a CPR provider achieving recommended depth of chest compressions (Odds Ratio, OR=13.01; 95%CI: 7.12, 24.01) and rate of chest compressions (OR=13.00; 95%CI: 7.21, 23.44). CONCLUSION The use of an AV CPR feedback device significantly improved the delivered rate and depth of chest compressions closer to American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations.

Furthermore, Fluoxetine reduced viral infectivity in precision-cut human lung slices showing its activity in relevant human tissue targeted in severe infections. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in a decrease in viral protein expression. Fluoxetine is a racemate consisting of both stereoisomers, while the S-form is the dominant serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We found that both isomers show similar activity on the virus, indicating that the R-form might specifically be used for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Fluoxetine inhibited neither Rabies virus, human respiratory syncytial virus replication nor the Human Herpesvirus 8 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 gene expression, indicating that it acts virus-specific.

Random case file reviews indicated overuse and variability of practice among care providers. This prompted us to explore ways to rationalise antibiotic use. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of obstetricians, paediatricians and quality officers was formed to run this improvement initiative at a private hospital facility in India. Review of literature advocated formulating a departmental antibiotic policy. Creating this policy and implementing it using improvement methodology helped us rationalise antibiotic usage. INTERVENTIONS: We aimed to reduce the use of antibiotics from 42% to less than 10% in uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. We tested a series of sequential interventions using the improvement methodology of PlanCDoCStudyCAct (PDSA) cycles, an approach recommended by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Learning from the PDSA cycle of the previous intervention helped decide the subsequent change ideas. The interventions included creation of a departmental antibiotic policy, staff engagement, and modification in documentation, concept of dual responsibility and team huddles as feedback opportunities. Information was analysed to understand the progress and improvement with change ideas. RESULTS: Background analysis revealed that antibiotic usage ranged from 24% to 69% and average rate of antibiotic prophylaxis was high (42.28%) in low-risk uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. The sequential changes resulted in reduction in antibiotic usage to 10% in the target population by 4 months. Sustained improvement was noted in the following months. CONCLUSION: We succeeded in implementing a departmental antibiotic policy aligning it with existing international guidelines and our local challenges. Antibiotic stewardship was one of the first major steps in our journey to avoid multidrug-resistant infections.

Older adults have been identified as being at higher risk of poor outcomes if infected and in many countries have been subjected to greater restrictions on physical contacts with others. Most research so far points towards an increase in loneliness during the pandemic. However, there has been a lack of prospective studies based on representative samples of older adults, with the oldest old, older adults with low or no Internet usage, and those in poor health currently underrepresented. Despite the significance of cultural norms for individuals' standards for social relations and, thus, the experience of loneliness, there has been a lack of comparative research on loneliness in older adults during the pandemic. Reviews have found little evidence for what interventions and what elements of interventions are effective in reducing loneliness. There is potential for social relations to be maintained via technology-based solutions, although there is a risk of excluding older adults with limited resources who are both least likely to use technology and most vulnerable to loneliness. Furthermore, remote social contacts cannot fully compensate for the loss of physical contacts. Where stay-at-home orders are not imposed, supporting neighbourliness and the community use of accessible open spaces are other options. Finally, policy responses to the pandemic need to be more nuanced and non-ageist in order to avoid unnecessary increases in loneliness in older adults.","output":"Loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is a well-known method to protect the public against an epidemic outbreak, e.g., COVID-19. To this end, the government of a country or region would strive to achieve its target of vaccination coverage.

Exploring in this paper government coordination of public and private resources for vaccination, we model a vaccine system consisting of a public hospital, a profit-maximizing private clinic, and self-interested individuals, under three scenarios: (1) without information sharing (concerning vaccine inventory and vaccine price), (2) with information sharing and subsidy, and (3) with information sharing and allocation. We find that, under scenario (1), the vaccine demand is fully satisfied by the public hospital and the private clinic cannot make any profit. Under scenario (2), the private clinic is willing to enter the vaccine market with a positive profit-maximizing vaccination coverage. Under scenario (3), the socially optimal vaccination coverage may be lower than that under scenario (1). Moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to generate practical implications of the research findings for vaccination policy-making.

It consists of HCWs from various hospital sectors that admit COVID-19 patients using an online self-administered predesigned tool. RESULTS: Out of the 285 recruited participants, 36.1% had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Around 71% received training on PPE use. The perceived compliance was good for (PPE) usage (mean 2.60  1.10).

However, DNA vaccines suffer from limited immunogenicity and thus strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency are needed.

In the current study, we aim to introduce an approach to elicit potent CD4(+) T cell help for the enhancement of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination by using co-administration of a DNA vector expressing papillomavirus major and minor capsid antigens, L1 and L2. RESULT: We showed that co-administration of vectors containing codon-optimized bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) L1 and L2 in combination with DNA vaccines could elicit enhanced antigen-specific CD8(+) in both CRT/E7 and ovalbumin (OVA) antigenic systems. We also demonstrated that co-administration of vectors expressing BPV-1 L1 and/or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1/L2-specific CD4(+) T cell immune responses and L1-specific neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, we showed that co-administration with DNA encoding BPV1 L1 significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. In addition, the observed enhancement of CD8(+) T cell immune responses by DNA encoding L1 and L2 was also found to extend to HPV-16 L1/L2 system. CONCLUSION: Our strategy elicits both potent neutralizing antibody and therapeutic responses and may potentially be extended to other antigenic systems beyond papillomavirus for the control of infection and/or cancer.","output":"Co-administration with DNA encoding papillomavirus capsid proteins enhances the antitumor effects generated by therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and associated restrictive measures have implications for depressive symptoms (henceforth depression) of young people and risk may be associated with their reduced physical activity (PA) level. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and PA among college students with different gender and gender role (masculinity traits and femininity traits) during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study included 628 healthy college students from nineteen different locations. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scales (CES-D), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and the 50-item Chinese Sex-Role Inventory (CSRI-50) were used to measure depressive symptoms, PA continuous (weekly metabolic equivalent minutes, MET-minutes/week) and categorical indicators (activity level category) and gender role, respectively. The statistical analyses were used in partial correlation analysis, t-test, one-way ANOVA, moderation model tests, and linear regression model tests. RESULTS: Total of 34.72% participants had clinically relevant depression (16, CES-D scale). Total of 58.6% participants were classified as a low activity level for spending less time on PA. Depression significantly negatively correlated with MET-minutes/week in moderate-intensity PA but not vigorous and walking scores. Of note, the depression-PA association was only moderated by the low activity level group in terms of categorical scores across gender groups. Participants with higher masculinity traits were less likely to have depression among all participants. Moreover, more recovered cases and fewer deaths could also predict the lower depression risk in the high activity level group. CONCLUSION: Moderate-intensity PA is beneficial for reducing depression risk among college students at a low activity level. College students with fewer masculinity traits (regardless of gender) are highly vulnerable to depression during the outbreak of COVID-19.

METHOD: A large, prospective, multicentre, observational study with two TLC-Ag dressings (UrgoTul Ag/Silver and UrgoTul Ag Lite Border, Laboratoires Urgo, France) was conducted in Germany between May 2020 and May 2021. The main outcomes included a description of the treated patients and their wound management, the changes in wound infection and wound healing outcomes over a maximum period of four weeks of treatment, as well as the overall clinical assessment of the performance, local tolerance and acceptability of dressings. RESULTS: A total of 728 patients with wounds of various aetiologies and wound infection status were treated with the evaluated dressings in 39 centres for a mean duration of 2619 days, with an intermediate visit conducted in 712 (97.8%) patients after a mean period of 129 days. At the initial visit, it was established that the majority of patients (60.4%) had a wound infection, while the remaining cohort presented first clinical signs of a local wound infection (25.1%) or were at risk of wound infection (13.2%) (unclear status in 1.2%). Throughout the study period, all the parameters of wound infection continuously decreased, resulting at the final visit in a reduction by 78.9% of the prevalence of local wound infections and by 72.0% of the clinical signs of wound infection, the most rapidly diminished clinical sign being wound deterioration. Concurrently, in terms of the healing process, 92.1% of the wounds healed or improved, 3.2% remained unchanged and 1.7% worsened (data missing for 3.0%), and an improvement of the periwound skin was reported in 65.7% of the patients. Overall, the two dressings were 'very well accepted' by the majority of patients, with no uncomfortable feeling at wearing and no pain at dressing removal, and were assessed by the physicians as 'very useful' in the majority of the cases with a 'very good' efficacy in terms of antimicrobial activity and promotion of the wound healing process. Similar results were reported regardless of the wound type treated or of the TLC-Ag dressing evaluated. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with previous clinical evidence on TLC-Ag dressings.

We identified four topics related to fitness trackers that intersected with broader sociotechnical themes including data privacy, the workplace, health insurance companies, and sustainability. In teams, students researched the social and environmental impacts of fitness trackers for their topic and gave a presentation to the class including leading a discussion. This project was designed to scaffold learning, encourage class participation, and enhance the quality of presentation. Survey responses revealed that all student respondents found the practice presentation with the instructors held over Zoom as helpful in completing their assignments and presentations. Other aspects that students rated as helpful included providing a list of resources to start their research and an example presentation to clarify expectations about depth required. The global COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the project presentations being conducted remotely, which gave students the opportunity to practice facilitating using Zoom, a skill that is directly relevant to current industrial practice. Students were creative in how they encouraged their classmates to participate including using Zoom polls, Kahoot, and breakout rooms. Students' responses to survey questions demonstrate that they learned about the sociotechnical nature of engineering, believed the project topics mattered to them as engineers, and these topics were relevant to their majors. Students cited the environmental, social, and legal aspects of the project as most interesting to them as engineers. Thus this can serve as an example for other engineering educators for how to approach teaching sociotechnical content in engineering. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"On Track: Seeing Engineering as Sociotechnical using Fitness Trackers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A global pandemic of a new highly contagious disease called COVID-19 resulting from coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Cov-2) infection was declared in February 2020. Though primarily transmitted through the respiratory system, other organ systems in the body can be affected. Twenty percent of those affected require hospitalization with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. About half of the disease survivors have residual functional deficits that require multidisciplinary specialist rehabilitation. The workforce to deliver the required rehabilitation input is beyond the capacity of existing community services. Strict medical follow-up guidelines to monitor these patients mandate scheduled reviews within 12 weeks post discharge. Due to the restricted timeframe for these events to occur, existing care pathway are unlikely to be able to meet the demand. An innovative integrated post-discharge care pathway to facilitate follow up by acute medical teams (respiratory and intensive care) and a specialist multidisciplinary rehabilitation team is hereby proposed. Such a pathway will enable the monitoring and provision of comprehensive medical assessments and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. This paper proposes that a model of tele-rehabilitation is integrated within the pathway by using digital communication technology to offer quick remote assessment and efficient therapy delivery to these patients. Tele-rehabilitation offers a quick and effective option to respond to the specialist rehabilitation needs of COVID-19 survivors following hospital discharge.","output":"A Proposal for Multidisciplinary Tele-Rehabilitation in the Assessment and Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, in the context of the coronavirus crisis, the issue of ensuring the sustainable development of heavy industries is acute. However, theoretical and analytical researches alone are not sufficient for this, and economic science needs to develop fundamentally new approaches to the study of the development of industrial sectors. This article is devoted to the creation and testing of a simulation model for the development of individual sectors of the economy. The object of research is the metallurgical industry, as well as related ore mining, mechanical engineering and production of finished metal products. The theoretical basis of the research is a systematic approach that combines the theory of industry markets, economic growth, industrial economics, system dynamics and mathematical economics. The main research methods used are system analysis, statistical analysis to identify trends in changes in the main economic indicators, econometric modeling to build production functions, as well as mathematical modeling of macroeconomic systems. As a result, a simulation model developed in system dynamics notation is proposed, which makes it possible to evaluate the development of individual industries taking into account various changes. This model is built on the basis of the three-sector model of the national economy, where separate adjacent industries connected by dynamic feedback loops are identified as structural elements. The paper details the structure of the simulation model based on first-order dynamic equations, balance equations and nonlinear production functions. The simulation model allowed us to predict a number of scenarios for the development of metallurgical industries, taking into account changes in the labor force and investment in fixed assets. The results of the work can be used for forming proposals on industrial policy, monitoring the condition and efficiency of individual industries. ? 2021 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

Recent events connected to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted how the risks and consequences of this are no longer acceptable. Two papers, addressing the treatment of COVID-19, have been published in two of the most prestigious medical journals; the authors declared to have analysed electronic health records from a private corporation, which apparently collected data of tens of thousands of patients, coming from hundreds of hospitals. Both papers have been retracted a few weeks later. When such events happen, the confidence of the population in scientific research is likely to be weakened. This paper highlights how the current system endangers the reliability of scientific research, and the very foundations of the trust system on which modern healthcare is based. Having shed light on the dangers of a system without appropriate monitoring, the proposed analysis suggests to strengthen the existing journal policies and improve the research process using new technologies supporting control activities by public authorities.

MPS is often dismissed by clinicians while patients remain in pain for years. MPS can evolve into fibromyalgia, however, effective treatments for both are lacking due to absence of a clear mechanism. Many studies focus on central sensitization. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to systematically search cross-disciplinary empirical studies of MPS, focusing on mechanical aspects, and suggest an organic mechanism explaining how it might evolve into fibromyalgia. Hopefully, it will advance our understanding of this disease. Methods: Systematically searched multiple phrases in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, PEDro and medrXiv, majority with no time limit. Inclusion/exclusion based on title and abstract, then full text inspection. Additional literature added on relevant side topics. Review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PROSPERO yet to adapt registration for scoping reviews. Findings: 734 records included. Fascia can adapt to various states by reversibly changing biomechanical and physical properties. Trigger points, tension, and pain are a hallmark of MPS. Myofibroblasts play a role in sustained myofascial tension. Tension can propagate in fascia, possibly supporting a tensegrity framework. Movement and mechanical interventions treat and prevent MPS, while living sedentarily predisposes to MPS and recurrence. Interpretation: MPS can be seen as a pathological state of imbalance in a natural process; manifesting from the inherent properties of the fascia, triggered by a disrupted biomechanical interplay. MPS might evolve into fibromyalgia through deranged myofibroblasts in connective tissue, or \\"fascial armoring\\", which may explain pain, distribution of pain, decreased pressure/pain threshold, and other phenomena eg, occasional complete resolution after surgery. Movement is an underemployed requisite in modern lifestyle. Lifestyle is linked to pain and suffering. The mechanism of needling is suggested to be more mechanical than currently thought. MPS should no longer be overlooked but solidified in the domain of common modern medicine.","output":"Scoping Review and Interpretation of Myofascial Pain/Fibromyalgia Syndrome: An Attempt to Assemble a Medical Puzzle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In T1 colorectal cancer, the depth is the main factor assessing the degree of submucosal invasion (DSI) to predict the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). The width (WSI) and the area of submucosal invasion (ASI) have been suggested as additional parameters to assess the risk of LNM. A review of the literature was undertaken on the correlation between WSI and ASI parameters and the incidence of LNM. METHODS: A Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Library search was performed to retrieve all studies reporting correlation between WSI/ASI and risk of LNM in T1 colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Eight studies including 1727 patients were identified. All considered the degree of WSI and its influence on LNM: seven assessed different width cut-off of submucosal invasion, and one study the mean width of submucosal invasion in patients having or not involved lymph nodes. The WSI was significantly a prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05) in four studies. Both 2 and 3 mm seem to be the most discriminatory cut-off values of submucosal width invasion in defining the risk difference of LNM above and below the cut-off (2 mm, OR = infinite; 3 mm, OR = 6.9). Patients having a cut-off &#8804; 5 mm of WSI showed a low risk (5.6%) of LNM rendering radical surgery unnecessary. Four studies assessed the risk of LNM according to the involved submucosal area (width  depth). In two of these, the ASI was a significant prognostic factor for LNM (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The WSI and ASI seem to be reliable prognostic factors for LNM in T1 colorectal cancer.

These findings can become clinical conun drums when there is significant overlap with known and serious syndromes in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to report a case with a laboratory-proven diagnosis of COVID-19 and HELLP syndrome hypothesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old multigravida (g3p2, repeated cesarean section) 32-week pregnant patient reported to the emergency service with complaints of chills, cough and shortness of breath that started 6 days ago. Following comprehensive screening tests for the differential diagnosis of lymphopenia, high liver enzymes, low platelets, abnormal coagulation panel, high D-dimer, high total bilirubin, high LDH and HELLP syndrome in the laboratory examinations of the patient, the patients laboratory findings were evaluated as compatible with HELLP syndrome. Emergency cesarean section was performed on the patient because of maternal hypoxemia. The finalization of the microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19 resulted to start conventional COVID-19 treatment. The fetus was also confirmed to be positive for COVID-19, and the newborn died on the 5th postnatal day. Unfortunately, our mother patient died on the 10th day of her hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This report describes a case of multigravida, 30 years old, who presented with respiratory tract infection symptoms and hypothesized HELLP syndrome, who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The distinction between these two etiologies and onset times is extremely difficult. However, given the sequence of events in this case, it is reasonable to consider that COVID-19 may be an etiological factor associated with the pathophysiology of HELLP, despite the lack of conclusive evidence.","output":"COVID-19: A Cause of HELLP Syndrome?

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design. Methods Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382. Findings Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 040% (95% credible interval 029C054) to 006% (004C007), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17C24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17C24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45C68%, dependent on calendar time. Interpretation Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

Hospitals are facing a crisis-level shortage of critical supplies (e.g., hospital and ICU beds) and equipment (e.g., ventilators).

This work aims to create predictive models that can use Canada COVID-19 data and pandemic-related factors to accurately forecast 5 quantities -- three related to hospital resource utilization (i.e., number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators that will be needed by COVID-19 patients) and two to the pandemic progress (i.e., number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths) -- several weeks in advance. We developed a machine learning method that can use information (i.e., resource utilization, pandemic progress, population mobility, weather condition, and public policy) currently known about a region since March 2020, to learn 116 temporal convolutional network (TCN) models every week;each used for forecasting the weekly average of one of these 5 quantities in Canada (respectively, in six specific provinces) for each of the next 4 weeks -- e.g., on 20 Nov 2020, forecasting the average number of ICU beds that will be needed by COVID-19 patients in the region of Ontario for the week ending on 18 Dec 2020. We compared our method, versus other standard models, on the COVID-19 data and hospital resource data, on the tasks of predicting these 116 values, every week from Oct 2020 to July 2021.

Although evidence has shown that resilience is associated with positive psychological well-being, few interventions have been specifically designed to enhance the resilience of parents of children with cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a mobile deviceCbased resilience training program in reducing depressive symptoms and enhancing resilience and quality of life (QoL) in parents of children with cancer. METHODS: Parents of children diagnosed with cancer were recruited from the pediatric oncology wards of 3 tertiary hospitals in China. The participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (52/103, 50.5%) to undergo an 8-week mobile deviceCbased resilience training program or to the control group (51/103, 49.5%) to receive an 8-week program of placebo information. The study outcomes included resilience, depressive symptoms, and QoL, as measured by the ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Short Form of the 6-Dimension Health Survey, respectively. All data were collected at baseline and at 2 and 6 months of follow-up. The data analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. A generalized estimating equation was used to examine the effects of the intervention. RESULTS: The participants were mostly female (72/103, 69.9%), and their mean age was 33.6 (SD 5.2) years. The participants in the experimental group showed significantly higher levels of resilience (mean 67.96, SD 15.8 vs mean 58.27, SD 19.0; P<.001) and lower levels of depressive symptoms (mean 40.17, SD 9.9 vs mean 46.04, SD 10.9; P<.001) than those in the control group at 6 months of follow-up. The intervention showed statistically significant effects in improving resilience (=6.082; P=.01) and decreasing depressive symptoms (=?2.772; P=.04) relative to the control group. The QoL score in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group at 6 months of follow-up (mean 0.79, SD 0.2 vs mean 0.76, SD 0.3; P=.07); however, no statistically significant intervention effect was detected (=.020; P=.38).

Many algorithms were developed to identify COVID-19. One way of identifying COVID-19 is by computed tomography (CT) images. Some segmentation methods are proposed to extract regions of interest from COVID-19 CT images to improve the classification. In this paper, an efficient version of the recent manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm is proposed based on the oppositionbased learning called the MRFO-OBL algorithm. The original MRFO algorithm can stagnate in local optima and requires further exploration with adequate exploitation. Thus, to improve the population variety in the search space, we applied Opposition-based learning (OBL) in the MRFOs initialization step. MRFO-OBL algorithm can solve the image segmentation problem using multilevel thresholding. The proposed MRFO-OBL is evaluated using Otsus method over the COVID-19 CT images and compared with six meta-heuristic algorithms: sine-cosine algorithm, moth flame optimization, equilibrium optimization, whale optimization algorithm, slap swarm algorithm, and original MRFO algorithm. MRFO-OBL obtained useful and accurate results in quality, consistency, and evaluation matrices, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. Eventually, MRFO-OBL obtained more robustness for the segmentation than all other algorithms compared.

Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists, the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type (WT), DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response that predominantly involves type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the WT and DUBmut viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages.IMPORTANCE Macrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they \\"notice\\" the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell's ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses, one with reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the DUBmut virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and proinflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.","output":"Coronavirus Endoribonuclease and Deubiquitinating Interferon Antagonists Differentially Modulate the Host Response during Replication in Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease, caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), for which there are no approved treatments.

We identified and validated a compound (SSYA10-001) that specifically blocks the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsDNA unwinding activities of nsp13, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 5.70 and 5.30 M, respectively. This compound also has inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 8.95 M) in a SARS-CoV replicon assay, with low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)] = >250 M), suggesting that the helicase plays a still unidentified critical role in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Enzyme kinetic studies on the mechanism of nsp13 inhibition revealed that SSYA10-001 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to nucleic acid and ATP substrates. Moreover, SSYA10-001 does not affect ATP hydrolysis or nsp13 binding to the nucleic acid substrate. SSYA10-001 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase, other bacterial and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or reverse transcriptase. These results suggest that SSYA10-001 specifically blocks nsp13 through a novel mechanism and is less likely to interfere with the functions of cellular enzymes that process nucleic acids or ATP. Hence, it is possible that SSYA10-001 inhibits unwinding by nsp13 by affecting conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid. SSYA10-001 will be a valuable tool for studying the specific role of nsp13 in the SARS-CoV life cycle, which could be a model for other nidoviruses and also a candidate for further development as a SARS antiviral target.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication inhibitor that interferes with the nucleic acid unwinding of the viral helicase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: The study aimed to determine whether the MPs levels and platelet activation are affected by the COVID-19 infection in both malignant and non-malignant patients compared to healthy individuals and define their contribution to the COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and the relation of these MPs to other hematologic parameters.

Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) for the SA elderly were developed to address this need. These thirteen guidelines for the elderly collectively offer a basis of health practices that the elderly can follow to ensure that they are taking the right steps toward maintaining their health. While the guideline Eat clean and safe food is not included in the current SA FBDGs, this recommendation is of particular importance to the elderly, who face a much higher risk of foodborne illness than most of the general population due to a number of factors. Reduced immunity and other physiological changes are a result of ageing, malnutrition, diseases and and/or medication side effects. All these factors play a role in the elderlys risk of foodborne illness. Increased susceptibility to certain pathogens also causes higher rates of foodborne illness infection. Lastly, elderly peoples food safety knowledge and pre-established beliefs and practices regarding food handling and preparation can be influential in their sensitivity to foodborne disease. These risk factors, coupled with the heavy burden of foodborne illness and existing gaps in food safety policy, practices and education in SA, substantiate the need for a dietary guideline to address the importance of clean and safe food consumption among the elderly in SA.","output":"Eat clean and safe food: a food-based dietary guideline for the elderly in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the recent pandemic COVID-19, is reported to have originated from bats, with its intermediate host unknown to date.

The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery pefiod, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.","output":"Epithelial injury and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar regions of rats chronically exposed to a simulated pattern of urban ambient ozone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to provide an educational framework for not only the emerging COVID crisis but also future emergency remote teaching environments (ERTE).

Digital CT (DCT) aids manual CT by logging proximity contacts and timely notifying contacts of positive cases, contributing to greater epidemic. We aim to systematically review and critically appraise the available evidence on adoption, effectiveness, acceptance and barriers to access of available CT apps. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review by means of Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science and applying the PRISMA guidelines. We classified studies according to selected characteristics (eg, original data, mathematical models, policy papers, overview of the experience with national CT apps) in order to better outline our results. Results Our queries yielded 1201 articles, of which 790 remained after duplicates' removal. After applying a priori selected inclusion criteria, 428 (54.17%) were eliminated after screening by title and abstract. 362 records were included in our study: of them 33.7% were original studies, 54.1% were opinion papers not reporting quantitative data, 14.91% were mathematical models, 6% were systematic reviews on DCT-related topics. Among original studies, 11.47% described national experiences and 25.40% discussed adoption dynamics. Conclusions DCT adoption still faces several cultural, normative and technical barriers, ranging from adoption mandates to privacy issues, to device compatibility. Overall, scant evidence is available on the impact of DCT in controlling infection spread and wide heterogeneity persists within studies in term of design and assessed outcomes Future research is needed based on shared evaluation frameworks.

More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far, while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment. Considering the global healthcare urgency, several techniques, including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging have been employed for diagnosing infected people. Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission. Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces with which people may come in contact. Detection based on non-contact optical techniques is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus, and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces. Nanomaterial-based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection. Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions, this manuscript critically reviews recent literature to specifically illustrate nano-engineered effective and rapid solutions. In addition, all the different techniques are critically analyzed, compared, and contrasted to identify the most promising methods. Moreover, promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations, via color change and light-sensitive nanostructures, to assist fingerprint techniques (to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase) are also presented.","output":"Point-of-Use Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2: Nanotechnology-Enabled Solutions for the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dire and unprecedented circumstance caused by Covid-19 has disturbed the education systems not only in the UAE, but also all over the world.

METHODS: An ad-hoc web-based survey questionnaire assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on therapeutic setting in Mental Health Services was sent via email from March 15, 2021 to June 15, 2021 to mental health providers in Genova, Italy. The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms(?) software was used. RESULTS: Two hundred nineteen mental health providers completed the survey, and the overall response rate (ORR) was 65%. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the continuity of care was mainly guaranteed using electronic devices. Psychologists reported a higher availability of video call assistance service to guarantee continuity of care for psychiatric patients compared to psychiatrists and psychotherapists (p<0,001). Psychiatrists reported the lowest degree of satisfaction about this new telematic approach (p<0,01), while psychologists and to a lesser extent psychotherapists speculated to use it even in non-pandemic times (p=0,02). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic creates an opportunity to overcome normative, technological and cultural barriers to the use of online psychotherapy, showing the importance of adapting the therapeutic setting to both collective and individual needs.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Vietnamese man with past medical history significant for hypertension presented to the hospital with acute on chronic worsening of altered mental status, personality changes, and gait dysfunction. Initial vitals revealed temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate 87 beats/minute, blood pressure 150/87 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam was notable for altered mental status, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, and right lower facial droop. Cardiopulmonary exam was within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) showed a left frontotemporal mass, with subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a ring-enhancing lesion concerning for a brain abscess. The abscess was urgently drained; however, there was intraoperative spillage into the ventricles. Intraoperative cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the patient was maintained on appropriate antibiotics. He developed worsening mental status, septic shock, and cerebral edema requiring decompressive left hemicraniectomy. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no hepatic lesions.

We target two most common yet divergent problems from Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) of ASD children - communication and gross motor skills. We present results from three studies a) toy robot Cozmo assists SEs in verbal lessons in school premises, b) mini drone Tello helps SEs in exercise lessons in school premises, and c) Cozmo, SEs, and ASD children connect remotely, as mandated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, for verbal lessons. All three studies showed improvement in learning outcomes and reduction in prompts from the SEs, denoting reduced workload. The effect of a robot's virtual presence in online ASD interventions has not been studied before. However, our results show that children spent more time on lessons in online intervention with Cozmo, suggesting that using robots should also be considered when designing online interventions. Furthermore, the roles of Cozmo were analyzed, and we found children showed increased spontaneous interaction when Cozmo acts as a Co-Instructor.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and the Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed literature. Our primary outcome is the perpetration of violent acts directed at others. Our secondary outcome is physical, interpersonal aggression measured through validated surveys. We will include randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies that examine the association between the use of antidepressants and violence perpetration and/or physical aggression. No restrictions will be placed on the population. We will use the Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research scale to assess the quality of included studies.

ISTL8 along with the production of EPS (Extracellular polymeric substances) using carbofuran, a toxic carbamate pesticide. Bacillus strain was isolated from landfill soil and evaluated for high growth rates and EPS production. One strain, renamed ISTL8 grew on a broad range of carbon sources, including toxic carbofuran, while producing copious EPS. Growth assays verified the strain to be thermophilic, low salt tolerant, and with a preference for neutral pH. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) was used for morphological characterization of the EPS while the monomeric composition, bonding patterns and functional groups were deduced by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry), 1H and 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). The production of EPS using carbofuran (carbamate pesticide) as a carbon source was found to be 6.20  0.29 g L-1 containing 61.17% w/w carbohydrates, 29.72% w/w proteins and 6.11% w/w lipids (of dry EPS). The potential cytotoxicity of EPS was evaluated with 3- (4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-Yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and found non-toxic (2.25%). WGS (Whole genome sequencing) was performed for the strain Bacillus sp. ISTL8 producing EPS; an array of genes putatively involved in the EPS production were identified in several different genomic locations, guiding potential genetic manipulation studies in the future. The results highlight the potency of a bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. ISTL8 to produce non-cytotoxic EPS using carbofuran that can be further harnessed for environmental and commercial applications. Additionally, WGS revealed an array of EPS specific genes which can be effectively engineered for much enhanced production.","output":"Genomic Insights into waste valorized extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by Bacillus sp.

Sustainable and delicate designs are necessary to create safe, healthy and comfortable courtyard environment. Most of the available literature focused on thermal comfort for courtyard, and the researches towards air pollution/disease control was rare. Further considering the severe impact of COVID-19 crisis, the current study aims to develop a numerical strategy to optimize physical environment in courtyard, including distributions of airborne pollutant, drought sensation and infection risk. Experimental data from literature was used to validate the numerical models. The evaluation indexes were adopted for the assessment of draft sensation, pollution exposure risk etc. The influences of geometric design parameters (i.e., courtyard width, height etc.) were investigated, and courtyard width (D) was the most sensitive parameter. If D increased from 5.8 m to 11.8 m, average air pollutant concentration decreased by 80 %, while drought sensation increased by 30 %. In static wind conditions, infection possibility (with R value up to 3 %) in courtyard was comparable to those in indoor environments during the COVID-19 period.

These policies and strategies have been based upon the general population and in fact could be detrimental to the health and well\\\\being of people with IDD. This paper provides a review of the key learning points emerging from the COVID\\\\19 literature, together with guidance for the provision of services and government interventions for people with an IDD for future pandemics. Using guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute, a scoping review was used to explore the current literature (scientific and grey) on IDD and COVID\\\\19. Three core themes emerged from the review. Prevention/protection: User\\\\friendly accurate accessible information, handwashing and social distancing, Personal Protective Equipment, shielding, track and trace, testing, vaccine compliance/hesitancy, and training. Mitigation: Making reasonable adjustments both to where people live, and to community healthcare/clinical practice;and the use of technology as a pandemic\\\\response strategy. Treatment/Management: Access to acute hospitals and lifesaving equipment, using a suitable clinical fatality assessment instrument, stopping Do Not Resuscitate notices, individualised care plans and hospital passports, family/paid carers to support people in hospitals;and use of telehealth in clinical care. This is the first international scoping review that provides a narrative synthesis of emerging themes related to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and people with an IDD.

The aerosols and saliva droplets are the main contamination source. Thus, it is crucial to point out that dental practitioners become a high-risk group of contagion by SARS-CoV-2. Based on this, protocols have been recommended to avoid cross-contamination during dental care; however, appropriate evidence has not yet been established. Objective Our study sought to make a screening, by in silico analysis, of the potential of mouth rinses used in dental practices to prevent the dental workers' contamination by SARS-CoV-2. Methodology Multiple sequence comparisons and construction of the phylogenetic tree were conducted using the FASTA code. Therefore, molecular docking investigation between SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Main Protease, Spike Glycoprotein, Non-structure Protein, and Papain-like Protease) and molecules used in dental practices (chlorhexidine digluconate, hydrogen peroxide, cetylpyridinium chloride, povidone-iodine, gallic acid, &#946;-cyclodextrin, catechin, and quercetin) was performed using AutoDock Vina. Moreover, 2D interactions of the complex protein-ligand structure were analyzed by Ligplot+. Results The obtained results showed a remarkable affinity between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and all tested compounds. The chlorhexidine digluconate, catechin, and quercetin presented a higher affinity with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The overall results allowed us to suggest that chlorhexidine is the most suitable active compound in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 salivary load due to its better binding energy.

The Oura Ring is a compact photoplethysmography-based smart ring, which has recently drawn attention to remote health monitoring and wellness applications. The ring is used to acquire nocturnal heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) parameters ubiquitously. However, these parameters are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. Therefore, a validity assessment of the parameters is required in everyday settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of HR and time domain and frequency domain HRV parameters collected by the Oura Ring against a medical grade chest electrocardiogram monitor. METHODS: We conducted overnight home-based monitoring using an Oura Ring and a Shimmer3 electrocardiogram device. The nocturnal HR and HRV parameters of 35 healthy individuals were collected and assessed. We evaluated the parameters within 2 tests, that is, values collected from 5-minute recordings (ie, short-term HRV analysis) and the average values per night sleep. A linear regression method, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the BlandCAltman plot were used to compare the measurements of the 2 devices. RESULTS: Our findings showed low mean biases of the HR and HRV parameters collected by the Oura Ring in both the 5-minute and average-per-night tests. In the 5-minute test, the error variances of the parameters were different. The parameters provided by the Oura Ring dashboard (ie, HR and root mean square of successive differences [RMSSD]) showed relatively low error variance compared with the HRV parameters extracted from the normal interbeat interval signals. The Pearson correlation coefficient tests (P<.001) indicated that HR, RMSSD, average of normal heart beat intervals (AVNN), and percentage of successive normal beat-to-beat intervals that differ by more than 50 ms (pNN50) had high positive correlations with the baseline values; SD of normal beat-to-beat intervals (SDNN) and high frequency (HF) had moderate positive correlations, and low frequency (LF) and LF:HF ratio had low positive correlations. The HR, RMSSD, AVNN, and pNN50 had narrow 95% CIs; however, SDNN, LF, HF, and LF:HF ratio had relatively wider 95% CIs. In contrast, the average-per-night test showed that the HR, RMSSD, SDNN, AVNN, pNN50, LF, and HF had high positive relationships (P<.001), and the LF:HF ratio had a moderate positive relationship (P<.001). The average-per-night test also indicated considerably lower error variances than the 5-minute test for the parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The Oura Ring could accurately measure nocturnal HR and RMSSD in both the 5-minute and average-per-night tests. It provided acceptable nocturnal AVNN, pNN50, HF, and SDNN accuracy in the average-per-night test but not in the 5-minute test. In contrast, the LF and LF:HF ratio of the ring had high error rates in both tests.","output":"Accuracy Assessment of Oura Ring Nocturnal Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability in Comparison With Electrocardiography in Time and Frequency Domains: Comprehensive Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19, the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, is challenging healthcare systems worldwide. Little is known about problems faced by emergency medical servicesparticularly helicopter servicescaring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. We aimed to describe the issues faced by air ambulance services in Europe as they transport potential COVID-19 patients. Methods: Nine different HEMS providers across Europe were invited to share their experiences and to report their data regarding the care, transport, and safety measures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 missions. Six air ambulance providers agreed and reported their data. 385 COVID-19-related missions were analysed, including 119 primary transport missions and 266 interfacility transport missions. Results: All providers had developed special procedures and safety instructions in preparation for COVID-19. Ground transport was the preferred mode of transport in primary missions, whereas air transport was preferred for interfacility transport. In some countries the transport of COVID-19 patients by regular air ambulance services was avoided. Patients in interfacility transport missions had a significantly higher median (range) NACA Score 3 (1-7) compared with 4 (2-5), needed significantly more medical interventions, were significantly younger (59.616 vs 6521 years), and were significantly more often male (73% vs 60.5%). Conclusions: All participating air ambulance providers were prepared for COVID-19. Safe care and transport of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is achievable. Most patients on primary missions were transported by ground. These patients were less sick than interfacility transport patients, for whom air transport was the preferred method.","output":"Pre-hospital care & interfacility transport of 385 COVID-19 emergency patients: An air ambulance perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engineering synthetic interfaces between membranes has potential applications in designing non-native cellular communication pathways and creating synthetic tissues. Here, InterSpy is introduced as a synthetic biology tool consisting of a heterodimeric protein engineered to form and maintain membrane-membrane interfaces between apposing synthetic as well as cell membranes through SpyTag/SpyCatcher interaction. Inclusion of split fluorescent protein fragments in the designed InterSpy toolkit allows tracking the formation of membrane-membrane interface and reconstitution of functional fluorescent protein in the space between apposing membranes. We first demonstrate InterSpy by testing split protein designs using a mammalian cell-free expression system. By utilizing co-translational helix insertion, cell-free synthesized InterSpy fragments are incorporated into the membrane of liposomes and supported lipid bilayers with a desired topology. Functional reconstitution of split fluorescent protein between the membranes is strictly dependent on SpyTag/SpyCatcher. Finally, since InterSpy is fully genetically encoded, the engineered system is adapted to cells and showcased. InterSpy demonstrates the power of cell-free expression systems in functional reconstitution of synthetic membrane interfaces via proximity-inducing proteins.

The upward trend we note in the use of these methods by nurse scientists over the past 2 decades mirrors a similar trend across scientists of all backgrounds. A broad range of study designs were represented in the literature we reviewed, with the majority involving untargeted metabolomics (n = 16, 53.3%) used to generate hypotheses (n = 13, 76.7%) of potential metabolites and/or metabolic pathways as mechanisms of clinical conditions. Metabolomics methods match well with the unique perspective of nurse researchers, who seek to integrate the experiences of individuals to develop a scientific basis for clinical practice that emphasizes personalized approaches.

The first involves the growing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the profound clinical cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Instead, it is recommended to treat alternatively with their MSC-released exosomes. This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID-19, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID-19 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID-19 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus. There is sufficient evidence, like recovery of patients with antibody deficiencies, to postulate that the antibodies actually have little effect and that immune resistance is principally due to T cell mechanisms. Further, COVID-19 convalescent plasma has remarkably weak beneficial effects if compared to what was expected from many prior studies. This may be due to the dysfunctional immune response to the infection and resulting weak Ab that may be impaired further by antagonistic exosomes in the convalescent plasma. At the least, pre selection of plasma for the best antibodies and relevant exosomes would produce the most optimum therapy for very severely affected COVID-19 patients.","output":"COVID-19 therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and convalescent plasma must consider exosome involvement: Do the exosomes in convalescent plasma antagonize the weak immune antibodies?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract While already sobering, Covid-19 mortality projections only account for a portion of morbidity and mortality we should expect from the current outbreak C patients directly affected by Covid-19.

We used multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess myocardial injury in recovered COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients (64  12 years, 70% male) with severe COVID-19 infection [all requiring hospital admission, 48 (32%) requiring ventilatory support] and troponin elevation discharged from six hospitals underwent convalescent CMR (including adenosine stress perfusion if indicated) at median 68 days. Left ventricular (LV) function was normal in 89% (ejection fraction 67%  11%). Late gadolinium enhancement and/or ischaemia was found in 54% (80/148). This comprised myocarditis-like scar in 26% (39/148), infarction and/or ischaemia in 22% (32/148) and dual pathology in 6% (9/148). Myocarditis-like injury was limited to three or less myocardial segments in 88% (35/40) of cases with no associated LV dysfunction; of these, 30% had active myocarditis. Myocardial infarction was found in 19% (28/148) and inducible ischaemia in 26% (20/76) of those undergoing stress perfusion (including 7 with both infarction and ischaemia). Of patients with ischaemic injury pattern, 66% (27/41) had no past history of coronary disease.

CONCLUSIONS: During convalescence after severe COVID-19 infection with troponin elevation, myocarditis-like injury can be encountered, with limited extent and minimal functional consequence. In a proportion of patients, there is evidence of possible ongoing localized inflammation. A quarter of patients had ischaemic heart disease, of which two-thirds had no previous history.

By using public assessed data in Lombardy, Italy, we estimated two congestion indices for isolation wards and ICU. The excess ICU needs were estimated in Lombardy, Italy, and other countries when data were available, including France, Spain, Belgium, New York State in the USA, South Korea, and Japan. RESULTS: In Lombardy, Italy, the congestion of isolation beds had increased from 2.2 to the peak of 6.0 in March and started to decline to 3.9 as of 9th May, whereas the demand for ICU during the same period has not decreased yet with an increasing trend from 2.9 to 8.0. The results showed the unmet ICU need from the second week in March as of 9th May. The same situation was shown in France, Spain, Belgium, and New York State, USA but not for South Korea and Japan.

A survey-weighted regression model was used to estimate the association between employer provision of hazard controls and voluntary use, and stratum-specific adjusted risk differences (aRDs) among workers reporting household incomes <250% and 250% of national poverty thresholds were estimated to assess effect modification by income. Approximately one half (45.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.0%-50.3%) of non-health care workers reported use of hazard controls in the workplace, 55.5% (95% CI = 48.8%-62.2%) of whom reported employer requirements to use them. After adjustment for occupational group and proximity to others at work, voluntary use was approximately double, or 22.3 absolute percentage points higher, among workers who were provided hazard controls than among those who were not. This effect was more apparent among lower-income (aRD = 31.0%) than among higher-income workers (aRD = 16.3%). Employers can help protect workers from COVID-19 by requiring and encouraging use of occupational hazard controls and providing hazard controls to employees (1).","output":"Required and Voluntary Occupational Use of Hazard Controls for COVID-19 Prevention in NonCHealth Care Workplaces  United States, June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article reports the results of study of the psychological aspects of the emotional health of the youth in educational process in the coronavirus pandemic conditions. In recent years, the psychological aspects of the personality emotional health are widely studied. In the last studies emotional health is considered on the base of individual characteristics of personality, such as anxiety, aggressiveness, etc. In the presented work the most representative factors linked to the quarantine influence on emotional sphere of personality are taken into account. We ascertain that there are not only negative but also positive tendencies in the influence of pandemic conditions on the emotional state of people. In this work, a conceptual model for the step-by-step study of the psychological aspects of emotional health is proposed. In the process of this study such psychological components of an emotional health as ontogenesis, emotiogenicity, significance, and severity are introduced. The emotional state of students is an important factor determining the effectiveness of the educational process. Accounting for the emotional state can be carried out on the basis of various approaches.

This paper presents a dosimetric comparative study between VMAT and IMRT delivery based on current literature, while also presenting the potential challenges encountered with volumetric arc therapy. Methods: A systematic search of the scientific literature was conducted within Medline/Pubmed databases. A number of 13 papers fulfilled the search criteria which was based on the main objective to evaluate dosimetric characteristics of comparative treatment delivery with VMAT vs IMRT in HNC. Results: Overall, from a dosimetric perspective, dose delivery via VMAT and IMRT present comparable results. Beside the delivery technique, target volume coverage also depends on the planner's expertise as well as the employed planning algorithm. At times, the superiority of VMAT emerges from the improved sparing of normal tissue, reduction of monitor units (MU) and of treatment delivery time. Similar to IMRT, one of the most important challenges of VMAT is the risk of developing secondary cancer due to the higher number of MUs compared to 3D-CRT. Conclusions: Based on the comparative results with the more established IMRT, VMAT in HNC can be safely delivered either as a single treatment or combined with other techniques.","output":"Dosimetric justification for the use of volumetric modulated arc therapy in head and neck cancer-A systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>Research shows how with the evolution of technologies, technological opportunism enables firms to effectively identify and exploit innovations and opportunities through strategic management practices, such as adopting an entrepreneurial orientation.

Labeled DES would be a useful tool for therapy of ER-positive mammary carcinomas and their metastases. Particularly with Auger emitters, high cytotoxic potential combined with only slight side effects can be expected. MATERIALS AND METHODS DES was labeled by a new method with higher yield and specific activity than former methods. Cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 (human, Caucasian, breast, adenocarcinoma) cells, were tested in relation to radioactivity concentration applied and location of decay. Different iodine isotopes ((123)I, (125)I, (131)I) bound to DES or in the form of iodide were compared with regard to induction of intracellular DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragmentation, and decrease of viability. For this purpose the 'Cell Death Detection Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)' and the water soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1 were used. The radiation protective effects of the radical scavenger vitamin C were also tested. RESULTS The experiments showed a significantly lower viability of cells exposed to the Auger emitters than those with the beta-emitter (131)I. All nuclides induced intracellular DNA fragments. The maximum amount of intracellular DNA fragments was different for all nuclides: (131)I-DES <(125)I-DES <(123)I-DES. With isotopes in the form of iodide, no increase of intracellular DNA fragmentation could be detected. Vitamin C reduced intracellular DNA fragmentation significantly, which points to an induction mechanism mainly via free radicals.

Here, we questioned whether an analysis of the individual stability curves from each resonance could provide additional site-specific information. We used the Yfh1 protein that has the unique feature to undergo both cold and heat denaturation at temperatures above water freezing at low ionic strength.

Human surfactant protein D (SP-D) is known to interact with spike protein of SARS-CoV, but its immune-surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 is not known. The study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of rfhSP-D with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using qPCR. In-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the RBD of spike of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 1.67 M rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by ~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 M). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 1.67 M rfhSP-D. These results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent rfhSP-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in-vitro.

The experience of vaccination against COVID-19 in oncohematological patients is low and mostly limited to studies of humoral immunity. However, the humoral and cellular immune responses between different oncohematological diseases (OHD) have not been compared. Objective: To compare the humoral and cellular immune responses in four groups of patients with OHD after receiving the first dose of one COVID-19 vaccine. Materials & methods: We recruited 53 patients in four groups according to diagnosis: Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia (CLL) (n=14), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) (n=11), Multiple Myeloma (MM) (n=15), and Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) (n=13) (Table 1). Samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3 weeks after receiving one dose of COMIRNATY (BioNTech-Pzifer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or AZD1222 (AstraZeneca). Twenty-six healthy donors with similar vaccination pattern were recruited. IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 were quantified by Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Direct cellular cytotoxicity (DCC) was determined against Vero E6 cells infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, measuring caspase-3 activation after co-culture with PBMCs, in which cytotoxic populations were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) analyses were performed using Annexin V on Raji cells as a target. Results: 1) Early humoral response against COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CML was 5.1- (p<0.0001), 2.8- (p=0.0027), and 3.2-fold (p<0.0001) higher than in patients with CLL, MM and HSCT, respectively, and 3.5-fold higher than in healthy donors (p=0.0460) (Fig. 1). 84% of CLL patients did not develop detectable IgG titers. Individuals with OHD developed lower titres of neutralizing antibodies than healthy donors. 2) Unspecific ADCC was overall reduced in patients with OHD, mostly in individuals with ASCT (3.2-fold lower (p<0,0001)), whereas ADCC was reduced 2.2- (p<0.0001), 1.8- (p=0.0040), and 2.2-fold (p<0.0001) in individuals with CLL, CML and MM, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, specific DCC was increased 4.7-, 8.1- (p=0.0189), and 2.1-fold, respectively, in PBMCs from patients with CLL, MM, or ASCT, in comparison with healthy donors, whereas patients with CML showed a very similar response than healthy donors (Fig. 2B). 3) Levels of CD3+CD8+TCRæ+ T cells were increased 2.2-, 2.1-, 2.7-, and 4.3-fold (p=0.0394) in patients with CLL, CML, MM, and ASCT, respectively, in comparison with healthy donors. CD3+CD8-TCRæ+ T cells were also increased in patients with OHD, expressing high levels of the degranulation marker CD107a. However, the levels of CD3-CD56+CD107a+ NK cells were reduced 4.2- (p=0.0003) and 3.6-fold (p=0.0010) in PBMCs from patients with MM and ASCT, respectively, in comparison with healthy donors. Conclusions: We found significant differences in the early humoral immune response after one single dose of COVID-19 vaccine depending on the OHD analyzed. It was observed for the first time that the early cytotoxic immune response is efficient in all groups of patients, although superior in those who were not exposed to ASCT. Most cytotoxic activity relied on CD8+ T cells. These data can be useful to determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with OHD.

Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted in the period between March 23 and April 12, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whith STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3,553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1,254 vs. 925microg/L; P=.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; P=.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg/L, CRP of 27mg/dl and D-dimers of 1.18mg/L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","output":"[Evolution and treatment of storm cytoquine syndrome associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection among octogenarians]./ Tratamiento y evolucin del sndrome de tormenta de citoquinas asociados a infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes octogenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Historical specimens collected from hospitalized children were tested for the following 13 viruses: influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses 1-3; human metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 and Adenovirus using monoplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).

[...]the courts addressed, possibly for the first time, the relationship between animal rights and federalism in order to evaluate whether the primate rights initiative would be inconsistent with federal law. The courts responded in the negative, finding that while the Swiss Civil Code precludes animals from having fundamental rights, the initiative sought to reform Swiss public law to alter the relationship between individuals and the state: as a result, cantons were free to extend rights to non-human animals.28 Secondly, the decision of the Federal Supreme Court departed from existing animal rights scholarship, which concentrates on the overlaps between human and animal rights. [...]it declared that the initiative does not aim to extend existing human constitutional rights to animals, but instead seeks to create special fundamental rights for non-human primates.29 Thirdly, the case resulted in an important opportunity for citizens to participate in lawmaking processes as it paved the way for the first ever direct democratic vote on whether some non-human animals should be granted basic rights to life and to bodily and mental integrity.30 While the two contributions adopt a different starting point C one grounded in a theoretical exercise, the other in the commentary of a judicial decision C they nevertheless converge in their claims that our legal systems need to be reconceptualized to better account for the non-human in our worlds. 3.","output":"Crossing (Conceptual) Boundaries of Transnational Environmental Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present Health Crisis tests the response of modern science and medicine to finding treatment for a new COVID-19 disease.

The workshop identified opportunities to refine NHP vaccine studies to minimize harm and improve welfare, which can yield better quality, more reproducible data. Careful animal selection, social housing, extensive environmental enrichment, training for cooperation with husbandry and procedures, provision of supportive care, and implementation of early humane endpoints are features of contemporary good practice that should and can be adopted more widely. The requirement for high-level biocontainment for some pathogens imposes challenges to implementing refinement but these are not insurmountable.","output":"Opportunities for Refinement of Non-Human Primate Vaccine Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mainstream guidelines for defining when to end the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals have been in use: the one-size-fits-all approach (i.e. patients are isolated for a fixed number of days) and the personalized approach (i.e. based on repeated testing of isolated patients). We use a mathematical framework to model within-host viral dynamics and test different criteria for ending isolation. By considering a fixed time of 10 days since symptom onset as the criterion for ending isolation, we estimated that the risk of releasing an individual who is still infectious is low (0C6.6%). However, this policy entails lengthy unnecessary isolations (4.8C8.3 days). In contrast, by using a personalized strategy, similar low risks can be reached with shorter prolonged isolations.

Subforecasts for the medical and surgical specialties, and for different lengths of stay were realised DESIGN: Autoregressive integrated moving average models were specified on a training dataset of daily count data, then tested on a 6-week forecast horizon. Explanatory variables were included in the models: day of the week, holiday days, lagged temperature and precipitation. SETTING: A secondary care hospital in an NHS Trust in South West England. PARTICIPANTS: Hospital admissions between September 2016 and March 2020, comprising 1291 days. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of the forecasts was assessed through standard measures, as well as compared with the actual data using accuracy thresholds of 10% and 20% of the mean number of admissions or occupied beds. RESULTS: The overall Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) admissions forecast was compared with the Trusts forecast, and found to be more accurate, namely, being closer to the actual value 95.6% of the time. Furthermore, it was more precise than the Trusts. The subforecasts, as well as those for bed occupancy, tended to be less accurate compared with the overall forecasts. All of the explanatory variables improved the forecasts. CONCLUSIONS: ARIMA models can forecast non-elective admissions in an NHS Trust accurately on a 6-week horizon, which is an improvement on the current predictive modelling in the Trust. These models can be readily applied to other contexts, improving patient flow.","output":"Can we accurately forecast non-elective bed occupancy and admissions in the NHS?

When mixed with Alum-adsorbed antigens, this TLR7-NP adjuvant elicited cross-reactive antibodies for both dominant and subdominant epitopes, as well as antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses. TLR7-NPs adjuvanted influenza subunit vaccine successfully protected mice from heterologous viral challenge. TLR7-NPs also enhanced the antibody response to a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine against multiple variants and revealed the mobilization of a virus-like response.

Responsibility is a useful lens through which to examine the current state of food poverty in the UK in the context of the Covid\\\\19 crisis, noting that this concept contains several paradoxes. Currently, responsibility involves the voluntary sector, the food industry and the state, a situation which the author has been exploring for the last five years in an ethnographic study of food poverty and food aid in the UK. Food aid organizations, especially food banks, have mushroomed during the period of austerity. This reveals the first paradox: namely, that the existence of food banks conveys the message that something is being done, but in actuality this is very far from being sufficient to meet the needs of either the old or new food insecure. The second paradox is that at the onset of the crisis, a government which had been responsible for inflicting austerity on the country for 10 years, dramatically reversed some of its policies. However, predictably, this did not change the situation vis\\\\\\\\vis food insecurity. The third paradox is that the frequent rhetoric invoking the two world wars has not resulted in lessons being learned C notably, the creation of a ministry to deal with food and rationing, as in the Second World War. The final paradox relates to Brexit and its likely deleterious effects on food security, particularly if no deal is achieved with the European Union, as seems likely.

We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells. These agents include cepharentine, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, clemastine, cloperastine, emetine, hydroxychloroquine, haloperidol, ML240, PB28, ponatinib, siramesine, and zotatifin (eFT226) all of which are likely to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by non-specific (off-target) effects, meaning that they probably do not act on their 'official' pharmacological targets, but rather interfere with viral replication through non-specific effects on acidophilic organelles including autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes. Imatinib mesylate did not fall into this cluster.

Recently, it has been shown that SGs exert anti-viral functions due to their involvement in protein synthesis shut off and recruitment of innate immune signaling intermediates. The largest RNA viruses, coronaviruses, impose great threat to public safety and animal health; however, the significance of SGs in coronavirus infection is largely unknown. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is the first identified coronavirus in 1930s and has been prevalent in poultry farm for many years. In this study, we provided evidence that IBV overcomes the host antiviral response by inhibiting SGs formation via the virus-encoded endoribonuclease nsp15. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed that IBV infection not only did not trigger SGs formation in approximately 80% of the infected cells, but also impaired the formation of SGs triggered by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or NaCl stimuli. We further demonstrated that the intrinsic endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 was responsible for the interference of SGs formation. In fact, nsp15-defective recombinant IBV (rIBV-nsp15-H238A) greatly induced the formation of SGs, along with accumulation of dsRNA and activation of PKR, whereas wild type IBV failed to do so. Consequently, infection with rIBV-nsp15-H238A strongly triggered transcription of IFN-? which in turn greatly affected rIBV-nsp15-H238A replication. Further analysis showed that SGs function as an antiviral hub, as demonstrated by the attenuated IRF3-IFN response and increased production of IBV in SG-defective cells. Additional evidence includes the aggregation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling intermediates to the IBV-induced SGs. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the endoribonuclease nsp15 of IBV interferes with the formation of antiviral hub SGs by regulating the accumulation of viral dsRNA and by antagonizing the activation of PKR, eventually ensuring productive virus replication. We further demonstrated that nsp15s from PEDV, TGEV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 harbor the conserved function to interfere with the formation of chemically-induced SGs. Thus, we speculate that coronaviruses employ similar nsp15-mediated mechanisms to antagonize the host anti-viral SGs formation to ensure efficient virus replication.","output":"Inhibition of anti-viral stress granule formation by coronavirus endoribonuclease nsp15 ensures efficient virus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The central California coast is a highly productive, biodiverse region that is frequently affected by the toxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Despite the consistent presence of A. catenella along our coast, very little is known about the movement of its toxins through local marine food webs. In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3-year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55% of surface water samples (n = 307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17,387 cells L(?1) at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71% of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962 ng STXeq L(?1). Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250 g STXeq 100 g(?1)), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23.2 g STXeq 100 g(?1)), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49.3 g STXeq 100 g(?1)) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23.8 g STXeq 100 g(?1)).

The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively).

Limited data are available on how a patient's concomitant cancer diagnosis affected ethical concerns raised during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all COVID-related ethics consultations registered in a prospectively collected ethics database at a tertiary cancer center between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Primary and secondary ethical issues, as well as important contextual factors, were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-six clinical ethics consultations were performed on 24 patients with cancer (58.3% male; median age, 65.5 years). The most common primary ethical issues were code status (n = 11), obligation to provide nonbeneficial treatment (n = 3), patient autonomy (n = 3), resource allocation (n = 3), and delivery of care wherein the risk to staff might outweigh the potential benefit to the patient (n = 3). An additional nine consultations raised concerns about staff safety in the context of likely nonbeneficial treatment as a secondary issue. Unique contextual issues identified included concerns about public safety for patients requesting discharge against medical advice (n = 3) and difficulties around decision making, especially with regard to code status because of an inability to reach surrogates (n = 3). CONCLUSION: During the early pandemic, the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 spurred a number of ethics consultations, which were largely focused on code status. Most cases also raised concerns about staff safety in the context of limited benefit to patients, a highly unusual scenario at our institution that may have been triggered by critical supply shortages.","output":"COVID-19-Related Ethics Consultations at a Cancer Center in New York City: A Content Review of Ethics Consultations During the Early Stages of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by novel coronavirus SARCoV2, is a contagious disease, emerged in the end of December 2019, at Wuhan seafood market, China This disease is spiraling like a wildfire and rapidly spreading worldwide, overburdening the health system with newly infected cases As of April 25, 2020, a total of 2,846,536 COVID-19-positive cases and 197,859 total deaths were reported across the globe This epidemic has exponential growth characteristics in the absence of specific vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 Many countries across the world including India, the USA, China, Italy, and German are implementing the lockdown measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to maintain the infection at manageable levels Keeping the prospectus of future such pandemics, we reviewed;what is lockdown and containment?

Together with physical ailments, many people have had a varied mental symptomatology that can be likely to give rise to psychosomatic diseases.","output":"Gastrointestinal Health of People Working From Home Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Online, Cross-sectional Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Pregnancy is an important time for developing attitudes and beliefs about childhood vaccinations Vaccinations are among the most effective way of preventing some infectious diseases Discussions on vaccinations have increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic and there is an opportunity to give society correct information on vaccinations Aim The aim of the study was to determine the opinions of pregnant women on vaccinations in pregnancy and childhood and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on these views Methods The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study The sample included 152 pregnant women Data were collected through a 25-item online questionnaire created by the researchers Results It was found in our study that 29 6% of pregnant women using forum websites exhibited hesitant attitudes towards vaccinations The vaccine hesitancy rate was found to be high in pregnant women who said that their economic level was low and who worried about the risks of vaccination The Covid-19 pandemic was reported to be the cause of a decrease in vaccine hesitancy in 28 9% of the participants Conclusion The events surrounding the pandemic provided an opportunity to explain how pregnant women feel about vaccinations Providing pregnant women with access to correct information from health workers may reduce the problem of trust, which is among the most important reasons for vaccine hesitancy","output":"The Effects of the COVID 19 Pandemic on Vaccine Decisions in Pregnant Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment with high affinity for dabigatran reversing its anticoagulant effects within minutes. Thereby, patients with acute ischemic stroke who are on dabigatran treatment may become eligible for thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). In patients on dabigatran with intracerebral hemorrhage idarucizumab could prevent lesion growth. AIMS To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of acute ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January 2016 to August 2018 were used. RESULTS One-hundred and twenty stroke patients received idarucizumab in 61 stroke centers. Eighty patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 40 patients suffered intracranial bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in n = 27). In patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA following idarucizumab, 78% showed a median improvement of 7 points in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. No bleeding complications were reported. Hematoma growth was observed in 3 out of 27 patients with ICH. Outcome was favorable with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement of 4 points and modified Rankin score 0-3 in 61%. Six out of 40 individuals (15%) with intracranial bleeding died during hospital stay. CONCLUSION Administration of rt-PA after reversal of dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of acute ischemic stroke seems feasible, effective, and safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab appears to prevent hematoma growth and to improve outcome.","output":"Antagonizing dabigatran by idarucizumab in cases of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage in Germany-Updated series of 120 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is challenging to capture glycoprotein from complicated samples with both high specificity and high recovery. Herein, we synthesized temperature-responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid) (PNIPAM-VPBA) microgels having enhanced affinity capability towards glycoprotein, resulting signal amplification in colorimetric analysis subsequently. Through temperature control, the target glycoprotein can be captured and released by the reported microgels unbiasedly. The microgels fabricated were characterized in terms of particle size, phase transition temperature, and toxicity. It was revealed that obvious changes in the particle diameter ranged from 600 to 323 nm between 25 C and 55 C, the volume transition temperature was close to human physiological temperature, and low toxicity towards HeLa cells after 24 h incubation. Using glucose oxidase as a model target, the microgels were applied as adsorbent materials for preconcentration of glucose oxidase, resulting 22-fold signal enhancement and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 16.7 U/L. In beer sample analysis, satisfied recoveries of 78.7%-101.6% with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 7.2% was observed. Subsequently, the microgels were combined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for alpha fetoprotein (AFP) determination, by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-AFP antibodies on the surface of microgels. A meaningful low concentration range of 2.5  10-2 to 1.0 g/L was obtained for AFP detection using the microgels based colorimetric method with a LOD of 8.4 ng/L. In human serum sample analysis, good accuracy was achieved from method comparing with commercial ELISA kit, satisfied recoveries of 86.1%-96.4% with the RSDs less than 6.0% was observed.

The control group (n = 63) was also divided into regular gamers (n = 14) and non-gamers (n = 49). Participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV and self-reported questionnaires regarding IGD severity and gaming hours. The IGD group had significantly lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) scores, compared with regular gamers and non-gamers. The IGD group also exhibited lower Working Memory Index (WMI) scores, compared with non-gamers. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly lower PSI score, compared with non-gamers. Furthermore FSIQ, VCI, WMI, and PSI scores were significant predictors of gaming hours in the IGD group. For the high-risk group, FSIQ, WMI, and VCI scores were negatively associated with gaming hours.

The cross-section of diseases to which these cells are applied is very wide, ranging from degenerative diseases, through autoimmune processes and to acute inflammatory diseases, e.g., viral infections. Indeed, now that first clinical trials applying MSCs against COVID-19 have started, important questions concern not only the therapeutic properties of MSCs, but also the changes that might occur in the cell features as a response to the cytokine storm present in the acute phase of an infection and capable of posing a risk to a patient. The aim of our study was thus to assess changes potentially occurring in the biology of MSCs in the active inflammatory environment, e.g., in regards to the cell cycle, cell migration and secretory capacity. The study using MSCs derived from Whartons jelly (WJ-MSCs) was conducted under two aerobic conditions: 21% O(2) vs. 5% O(2), since oxygen concentration is one of the key factors in inflammation. Under both oxygen conditions cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines involved significantly in acute inflammation, i.e., IFN, TNF and IL-1 at different concentrations. Regardless of the aerobic conditions, WJ-MSCs in the inflammatory environment do not lose features typical for mesenchymal cells, and their proliferation dynamic remains unchanged. Sudden fluctuations in proliferation, the early indicator of potential genetic disturbance, were not observed, while the cells migration activity increased. The presence of pro-inflammatory factors was also found to increase the secretion of such anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-4 and IL-10. It is concluded that the inflammatory milieu in vitro does not cause phenotype changes or give rise to proliferation disruption of WJ-MSCs, and nor does it inhibit the secretory properties providing for their use against acute inflammation.","output":"The Effect of Proinflammatory Cytokines on the Proliferation, Migration and Secretory Activity of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (WJ-MSCs) under 5% O(2) and 21% O(2) Culture Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recurrent bacterial infection causes frequent bronchiectasis (BE) exacerbations.

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Embase, KoreaMed, Igaku Chuo Zasshi, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which elucidated long-term macrolide treatment ( 4 weeks) in non-cystic fibrosis BE in children aged < 18 years. The primary outcome was frequency of acute exacerbation; secondary outcomes included changes in pulmonary function, sputum scores, and adverse events including bacterial resistance. We included four RCTs. Long-term macrolide treatment showed a significant decrease in the frequency of exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.87), mean number of exacerbations per patient (mean difference, - 1.40; 95% CI, - 2.26 to - 0.54), and sputum purulence score (mean difference, - 0.78; 95% CI, - 1.32 to - 0.24). However, long-term macrolide treatment was accompanied by an increased carriage of azithromycin-resistant bacteria (OR, 7.13).

The virus first occurred in Wuhan, China, but the whole world is now struggling with the pandemic. Over 13 million confirmed cases and 571,000 deaths have been reported so far, and this number is growing. Older people, who constitute a notable proportion of the world population, are at an increased risk of infection because of altered immunity and chronic comorbidities. Thus, appropriate health care is necessary to control fatalities and spread of the disease in this specific population. The chapter provides an overview of diagnostic methods, laboratory and imaging findings, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 in aged people. Possible mechanisms behind the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly include immunosenescence and related impaired antiviral immunity, mature immunity and related hyper-inflammatory responses, comorbidities and their effects on the functioning of critical organs/systems, and the altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This evidence defines the herding behavior of COVID-19 in relation to ACE2 under the influence of immune dysregulation.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 40 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected, and serum cytokines were kinetically assessed. A multivariable-adjusted generalized linear regression model was used to analyze the differences in serum cytokine levels between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Among the 40 patients included, we found a positive correlation between multiple cytokines. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) in non-survivors were consistently elevated compared to those in the survivors. Kinetic variations in IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were associated with a fatal outcome in patients with severe COVID-19, independent of sex, age, absolute lymphocyte count, direct bilirubin, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer as well as the use of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab.

Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.","output":"Spatial super-spreaders and

We aimed to investigate whether secondary administration of HIVST kits, with or without an additional financial incentive, via women receiving antenatal care (ANC) or via people newly diagnosed with HIV (ie, index patients) could improve the proportion of male partners tested or the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: We did a three-arm, open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial of 27 health centres (clusters), eligible if they were a government primary health centre providing ANC, HIV testing, and ART services, across four districts of Malawi. We recruited women (aged &#8805;18 years) attending their first ANC visit and whose male partner was available, not already taking ART, and not already tested for HIV during this pregnancy (ANC cohort), and people (aged &#8805;18 years) with newly diagnosed HIV during routine clinic HIV testing who had at least one sexual contact not already known to be HIV-positive (index cohort). Centres were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a public selection of computer-generated random allocations, to enhanced standard of care (including an invitation for partners to attend HIV testing services), HIVST only, or HIVST plus a US$10 financial incentive for retesting. The primary outcome for the ANC cohort was the proportion of male partners reportedly tested, as ascertained by interview with women in this cohort at day 28. The primary outcome for the index cohort was the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive people identified per facility within 28 days of enrolment, as measured by observed HIV test results. Cluster-level summaries compared intervention with standard of care by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03705611. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2018, and May 2, 2019, nine clusters were assigned to each trial arm, resulting in 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort (1447 [318%] in the standard care group, 1465 [322%] in the HIVST only group, and 1632 [359%] in HIVST plus financial incentive group) and 708 eligible patients in the index cohort (234 [331%] in the standard care group, 169 [239%] in the HIVST only group, and 305 [429%] in the HIVST plus financial incentive group). 4461 (982%) of 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort and 645 (911%) of 708 eligible patients in the index cohort were recruited, of whom 3378 (757%) in the ANC cohort and 439 (681%) in the index cohort were interviewed after 28 days. In the ANC cohort, the mean proportion of reported partner testing per cluster was 350% (SD 100) in the standard care group, 730% in HIVST only group (131, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 171, 95% CI 148-198; p<00001), and 652% in the HIVST plus financial incentive group (116, adjusted RR 162, 145-181; p<00001). In the index cohort, the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive sexual partners per cluster was 135 (SD 162) for the standard care group, 191 (178) for the HIVST only group (incidence rate ratio adjusted for number eligible as an offset in the negative binomial model 165, 95% CI 049-555; p=03370), and 320 (381) for the HIVST plus financial incentive group (311, 099-977; p=00440). Four self-resolving, temporary marital separations occurred due to disagreement in couples regarding HIV self-test kits. INTERPRETATION: Although administration of HIVST kits in the ANC cohort, even when offered alongside a financial incentive, did not identify significantly more male patients with HIV than did standard care, out-of-clinic options for HIV testing appear more acceptable to many male partners of women with HIV, increasing test uptake. Viewed in the current context, this approach might allow continuation of services despite COVID-19-related lockdowns.

Objective: To quantify risk of development of COVID19 due to in-hospital transmission related to an electrophysiology procedure, in the setting of preventive measures instituted in our laboratory areas. Methods: We contacted patients by telephone who underwent emergent procedures in the electrophysiology lab during the COVID19 surge at our hospital (3/16/2020 to 5/15/2020, reaching daily census 450 COVID19 patients,) > two weeks after the procedure, to assess for symptoms of and/or testing for COVID-19, and assessed outcomes from medical record review. Results: Of the 124 patients undergoing EP procedures in this period, none had developed documented or suspected coronavirus infection. 7 patients described symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; 3 were tested for coronavirus and found to be negative. Of the remaining 4, 2 had a more plausible alternative explanation for the symptoms, and 2 had transient symptoms not meeting published criteria for probable COVID19 infection. Conclusion: Despite a high hospital census of COVID-19 patients during the period of hospital stay for an electrophysiology procedure, there were no likely COVID-19 infections occurring in follow up of at least two weeks.

The patient was a 78-year-old woman who visited the hospital after noticing a lump in her left breast 6 months before, which gradually increased in size. According to her family history, her maternal aunt developed breast cancer in her 40s. On palpation, a 4-cm large mass was palpated in the upper outer part of the left breast. A needle biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2. The patient was diagnosed with cT2N0M0 stage IIA, and primary systemic treatment was planned. The patient developed drug-induced interstitial pneumonia after receiving paclitaxel. Although she recovered spontaneously, she did not wish to receive further chemotherapy, and thus surgery was performed. Four months after the surgery, the patient became aware of dyspnea. After a thorough examination, she was diagnosed with postoperative cancer recurrence of the left breast with multiple liver metastases, cancerous peritonitis, multiple bone metastases, and multiple lymph node metastases. Genetic testing was performed, and pathogenic variants were found in both BRAC1 and BRCA2. However, her condition worsened, and she died 8 months after the surgery. BRCA pathogenic variants had more advanced breast cancer on initial diagnosis and worse cancer-related outcomes. It is desirable to consider the optimal approach to the treatment of breast cancer in pathogenic variants. In elderly patients with triple-negative breast cancer, HBOC may be suspected, based on biomarkers and family history.

Two measles outbreaks, occurred in Lazio region during 2006-2007, were investigated to identify sources of infection, transmission routes, and assess operational implications for elimination of the disease. METHODS: Data were obtained from several sources, the routine infectious diseases surveillance system, field epidemiological investigations, and molecular genotyping of virus by the national reference laboratory. RESULTS: Overall 449 cases were reported, sustained by two different stereotypes overlapping for few months. Serotype D4 was likely imported from Romania by a Roma/Sinti family and subsequently spread to the rest of the population. Serotype B3 was responsible for the second outbreak which started in a secondary school. Pockets of low vaccine coverage individuals (Roma/Sinti communities, high school students) facilitated the reintroduction of serotypes not endemic in Italy and facilitated the measles infection to spread. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with low vaccine coverage represent a more serious public health threat than do sporadic susceptible individuals.

Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency. Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions, concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis. The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development. Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.","output":"COVID-19 and Digital Transformation -- Developing an Open Experimental Testbed for Sustainable and Innovative Environments (ETSIE) using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has presented Radiation Oncology with unique challenges.

Regardless of different risk factors, it has been testified that ONFH results from primitive vascular problems, leading to temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to bone tissue. Histopathological and microarchitectural alterations ensues, which is a gradual evolutionary process involving bone marrow and osteocyte necrosis, progressive destruction of subchondral bone, unsuccessful reparative process, and eventual articular collapse and degenerative arthritis. Based on the imaging features of ONFH, different classification systems have been developed to evaluate the severity and prognosis of the disease, which is pivotal for implementation of treatment strategy, especially the joint-preserving surgery. However, patients classified with the same severity stage, especially in the peri-collapse stage, sometimes responded differently after similar joint-preserving surgery. The unusual phenomenon may be attributed to the limitation of the current imaging classification systems, which might underestimate the disease severity, especially when referring to the early stages. In this review, we briefly summarize the etiology and pathogenesis of ONFH. The imaging features and staging classification systems of ONFH are also described. More importantly, we focus on histopathological and microstructural alterations of the femoral head, and provide an overview of their essential contribution to ONFH progression.

Methods: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgG(NC)) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG(NC) to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgG(NC), IgM-spike (IgM(SP)), and IgG-spike (IgG(SP))) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort. Results: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgG(NC) serology performed. Prospectively, IgG(NC) serology identified twice the number of COVID-positive cases in relation to RT-PCR alone. COST further increased the number of detected positive cases: IgG(NC)+ or IgM(SP)+ (18.0%); IgG(NC)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.5%); IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (23.8%); and IgG(NC)+ or IgM(SP)+ or IgG(SP)+ (141/584 = 24.1%). Conclusion: COST may be an effective tool for the evaluation of infection proportion and thus could define a cohort for a single dose and/or delayed vaccination.","output":"Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Availability: Role for Combined Orthogonal Serology Testing (COST)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Systemic coagulation activation and thrombotic complications are frequent among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Limited data are available in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Purpose To determine the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Methods We studied consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to general ward at Strasbourg Hospital, France (25.02.2020C19.04.2020). The primary outcome was any VTE complication. The secondary outcome was the composite of death or transfer to ICU. Results Among the 289 patients included (62.217.0 years, 59.2% male), VTE occurred in 49 (17.0%). Padua prediction score for VTE was similar between VTE and non-VTE patients. VTE imaging tests were performed in 100 (34.6%) patients and VTE diagnosed in median 7 (3C11) days after admission. On-admission, time from symptom onset to admission (OR 1.07, CI 95% [1.00C1.16], P =0.045), Improve score (OR 1.37, [1.02C1.83], P =0.032), leukocyte count (OR 1.16, [1.06C1.27], P =0.001) and lack of thromboprophylaxis (OR 27.85, CI 95% [9.35C82.95], P <0.001) were independent predictors of VTE. The incidence of the composite of death or ICU transfer was 31.0% and more frequent among patients with VTE (47.9% vs. 27.9%, P =0.01). Fever (OR 5.37, CI 95% [1.44C19.97], P =0.012), VTE (OR 3.44, CI 95% [1.63C7.25], P =0.001), lymphopenia (OR 0.32, 95% CI [0.15C0.71]; P =0.005) and extent of COVID-19 evaluated by chest CT severity (OR 1.56, 95% CI [1.12C2.16]; P =0.007) were independently associated with in-hospital death or transfer to ICU (Table 1, Fig. 1). Conclusions The 17.0% incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients with COVID-19 was associated with worse outcomes.

Sequence analysis of the spike protein genes of the escape mutants identified a single nucleotide substitution of C to T at position 1583, resulting in the change of alanine to valine at amino acid position 528 (A528V). The mutation occurs in domain II and in a location which corresponds to the hypervariable region of the spike protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus.

Both STN assays had a low limit of detection and did not cross react with other human coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Using 213 initial respiratory specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity of both the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and the STN COVID-19-N assays was 100% (99/99), while that of the comparator non-nested N assay was 95% (94/99). Among 108 follow-up specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, 28 (25.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel or the STN COVID-19-N assay. To evaluate the performance of our novel STN assays in pooled specimens, we created four sample pools, with each pool consisting of one low positive specimen and 49 negative specimens. While the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive in only one of four sample pools (25%), both of the STN assays were positive in two of four samples pools (50%). In conclusion, the STN assays are highly sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

The oil industry has been following the path of several other industrial sectors and has implemented digitalization to solve different challenges and problems. The present work, supported by extensive research carried out in the specialized literature, shows relevant applications of digital transformation to solve problems in drilling and production operations during the life cycle of an oil well. The main issues addressed in the research were stuck pipes and hydrate formation. The achievements show that control systems and the various sensors used during drilling and the useful life of an oil well generate data that creates opportunities for the use of computational and artificial intelligence techniques. New technologies associated with digital transformation include smart surveillance systems, real-time monitoring, and intelligent equipment. In a well oil environment, these novelties are associated with fault detection and prediction systems to avoid or reduce problems or accidents that may cause costs or, in extreme cases, lead to the loss of the well.

In parallel, a decrease in emergency patients was observed in the public health system. Methods: For two 10-week periods before and during the lockdown, ambulance service deployment rates were analysed in 6 ambulance service areas for 6 tracer diagnoses. Random effects were minimised by comparing the results with the corresponding 2018 and 2019 time periods and a calculated expected value. Results: For emergency ambulance service calls, there was a reduction in call numbers (-16%) during the lockdown. A 20% reduction for the categories cardiac and cerebral ischaemia was found. In the urban area, the reduction in cardiac ischaemia was less pronounced at 14% than in the surrounding area at 23%. The deployment figures for intoxications decreased by 27% and for psychiatric emergencies by 16%. Conclusion: The public ambulance service was not overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic; there was a decrease in depolyments during the lockdown. For the reduction in cerebral or cardiac ischaemias, the explanatory models for the influence of the lockdown are missing.

Through single-cell RNAseq analysis, we identified Tig1/Rarres1 as a potential determinant of proximal identity. Tig1 encodes a conserved cell surface molecule, is regulated by retinoic acid and exhibits a graded expression along the proximo-distal axis of the limb. Its overexpression leads to regeneration defects in the distal elements and elicits proximal displacement of blastema cells, while its neutralisation blocks proximo-distal cell surface interactions. Critically, Tig1 reprogrammes distal cells to a proximal identity, upregulating Prod1 and inhibiting Hoxa13 and distal transcriptional networks.

METHODOLOGY: A total of 68 patients were recruited who consumed either FAR + SOC (n = 35) or SOC only (n = 33) for 28 days. Primary outcomes assessed were mean time required for clinical recovery and proportion of patients showing clinical recovery between the groups. Secondary outcomes assessed included mean time required for testing SARS-CoV-2 negative, change in clinical status on World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, number of days of hospitalization, change in disease progression and requirement of oxygen/intensive care unit admission/ventilator support/rescue medication, health status on WHO quality of life (QOL) BREF and safety on the basis of occurrence of adverse event/serious adverse event (AE/SAE) and changes in laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Patients consuming FAR as an add-on SOC showed faster clinical recovery from the day of onset of symptoms by 51.34% (P < 0.05) as compared to SOC group. A higher proportion of patients taking FAR recovered within the first 2 weeks compared to those taking only SOC. It was observed that 5 times more patients recovered within 7 days in FAR group when compared to SOC (P < 0.05) group. An earlier clinical recovery was observed in clinical symptoms such as sore throat, cough, loss of taste and myalgia (P < 0.05). Improvement in postclinical symptoms such as appetite, digestion, stress and anxiety was also obs served to be better with the use of FAR. Requirement of rescue medications such as antipyretics, analgesics and antibiotics was also found to be reduced in the FAR group (P < 0.05). FAR showed a significant improvement in all the assessed domains of QOL. None of the AEs/SAE reported in the study were assessed to be related to the study drugs. Further, FAR did not produce any significant change in the laboratory safety parameters and was assessed to be safe.

A lack of effective methods for screening potential patients, rapidly diagnosing suspected cases, and accurately monitoring the epidemic in real time to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 raises significant difficulties in mitigating the epidemic in many countries. As effective point-of-care diagnosis tools, simple, low-cost and rapid sensors have the potential to greatly accelerate the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients to improve their treatment and care. In particular, there is evidence that multiple pathogens have been detected in sewage, including SARS-CoV-2, providing significant opportunities for the development of advanced sensors for wastewater-based epidemiology that provide an early warning of the pandemic within the population. Sensors could be used to screen potential carriers, provide real-time monitoring and control of the epidemic, and even support targeted drug screening and delivery within the integration of emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology.

The iBMW will provide an effective approach to prevent, evaluate and intervene in a fast, affordable and reliable way, thus enabling real-time guidance for the government in providing effective intervention and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention.","output":"The potential of an integrated biosensor system with mobile health and wastewater-based epidemiology (iBMW) for the prevention, surveillance, monitoring and intervention of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A stochastic epidemic model with infectivity rate in incubation period and homesteadCisolation on the susceptible is developed with the aim of revealing the effect of stochastic white noise on the long time behavior.

This study aimed to explore whether mainland China will face an epidemic rebound during the Spring Festival holiday, when millions of Chinese people travel across the country, and investigate which nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy is optimal to contain the epidemic. A microsimulation model was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among railway travelers and evaluated the effects of various NAT strategies. An extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was built to forecast local transmission during the Spring Festival period under different scenarios of testing strategies. The total number of infections, testing burden, and medical expenditure were calculated to devise an optimal strategy during the Spring Festival travel rush. Assuming the daily incidence of 20 per 10 million persons, our model simulated that there would be 97 active infections on the day of travel among 10 million railway passengers without NAT and symptom screening. Pre-travel testing could reduce the number of active infections. Compared with no NAT, testing passengers from risk tier 2-4 regions 3 days before travelling could significantly reduce the risk of transmission, and it is more economical and efficient than testing for all passengers.","output":"An Optimal Nucleic Acid Testing Strategy for COVID-19 during the Spring Festival Travel Rush in Mainland China: A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monensin, at concentrations which depended on the multiplicity of infection, was found to prevent DNA replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as well as production of viral progeny in human foreskin fibroblasts.

We used conventional, 2-dimensional (2D) phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to assess the relationship between altered flow and future growth in patients with BAV. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aortic MRI data were reviewed for 17 adult patients with BAV with right-left leaflet fusion undergoing surveillance imaging who had 2D PC-MRI through their ascending aortas on an initial study, follow-up studies more than 1 year later, and an initial maximum aortic diameter of less than 4.5 cm. Diameters were measured at standard levels by 2 blinded reviewers. Normalized systolic flow displacement was calculated at peak systole from the PC-MRI data, and correlation with the interval aortic growth was performed, with adjustment for clinical/demographic factors. RESULTS The average follow-up interval was 2.9  1.3 years. Systolic flow displacement at the initial study strongly correlated with ascending aortic growth rate (r = 0.71, P < 0.005) with moderate, non-significant correlation between initial diameter and growth (r = 0.45, P = 0.214). Aortic growth was 4 times faster in patients with initial flow displacement of 0.2 or greater (n = 9) compared with those (n = 8) with initial flow displacement less than 0.2 (0.8  0.4 vs 0.2  0.3 mm/y; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Systolic flow displacement calculated from conventional 2D PC-MRI in the ascending aorta correlates with future aortic growth in patients undergoing routine surveillance imaging for BAV. With a cutoff valve of 0.2, flow displacement may be used to identify a subset of patients likely to have elevated growth rates and may better risk-stratify patients with BAV for aortic disease progression than vessel diameter alone.","output":"Systolic flow displacement correlates with future ascending aortic growth in patients with bicuspid aortic valves undergoing magnetic resonance surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this present world COVID-19 pandemic is one of the biggest concern.

Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) provide continuous surveillance of blood cultures to secure appropriate choice and duration of therapy. Comparing to historic data, we characterize our ASP experience in bacteremic surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Consecutive blood cultures at the Washington DC VA Medical Center were captured in an ASP-driven decision support software system (TheraDoc, Premier/DSS Inc) between Jan 1(st) 2018-May 31st 2020. In the setting of an established ASP, the organism positive cultures were reviewed over the first five months (Jan-May) of each of the three years collected. Results of cultures were characterized as either pathogenic gram positive (MSSA/MRSA/Enterococci/PSSP/PRSP/Strep sp.), pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram negative organisms and a skin contaminant-category (GPRs/skin flora/CNS). RESULTS: Over 3 yrs, 528 patients had 1464 positive cultures from among 8727 admissions, 83638 inpatient-days. The proportion of pathogenic GP bacteria and pathogenic GN bacteria were not statistically significantly different 38% (2018) vs 37% (2019) vs 39% (2020) and 33%, 31%, 27% respectively. There was slight trend in the increase of pathogenic GP 9.6 vs 9.5 vs 11.7 per 1,000 inpatient days and skin contaminant-category with 12.0 vs 11.0 vs. 14.1 per 1,000 patient days from 2019 to 2020.

METHODS: In this study we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness. RESULTS: Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a mechanism to overcome neutralization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain, critical for virus replication and virulence.","output":"Escape from Human Monoclonal Antibody Neutralization Affects In Vitro and In Vivo Fitness of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, dentistry has faced a halt as it involves face-to-face interaction with patients which had to be suspended for quite some time.

SETTING: Tertiary otolaryngology clinic setting from July to November 2020. METHODS: Tests were characterized by provider-specified indication (symptomatic, preprocedural, and universal), subspecialty, provider type, and contemporaneous regional COVID-19 positivity rate, defined as 12%. Positive results were further classified as true or false positive (TP or FP) based on repeat polymerase chain reaction testing wherever available, and true positivity rates were compared among groups by multiway chi-square and Fishers exact tests.

It includes stroke, brain haemorrhage or memory loss. METHOD: Such events have already been observed in the course of other viral diseases. In addition, preventive actions to stop the exponential progression of the virus have been adopted by most of countries (masks, physical distancing, lockdowns or curfews), with a common impact: the reduction of our social and physical relationships. Thus, this dramatic stop of human interactions, known as the most effective brain stimulation, may also severely impair cognitive reserve and resilience. The global spread of the pandemic suggests that tens of thousands of individuals may have had cerebral symptoms. Hence, we must take actions to predict the consequences of COVID19 on cognitive reserve and brain resilience. RESULTS: Aged and frail people are especially concerned: (1) due to their ages, they are at a very high risk of severe forms; (2) as the specific containment imposed to retirement home residents precluded any social relationships for long periods of time.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate system-based issues relating to the return of results (RoR) disclosure process for clinical grade research genomic tests to eMERGE3 participants. METHODS RoR processes were developed and approved by each eMERGE institution's internal review board. Investigators at each eMERGE3 site were surveyed for RoR processes related to the participant's disclosure of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and engagement with genetic counseling. Standard statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Of the 25,084 eMERGE participants, 1444 had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant identified on the eMERGEseq panel of 67 genes and 14 single nucleotide variants. Of these, 1077 (74.6%) participants had results disclosed, with 562 (38.9%) participants provided with variant-specific genetic counseling. Site-specific processes that either offered or required genetic counseling in their RoR process had an effect on whether a participant ultimately engaged with genetic counseling (P = .0052).

Methods We conducted an online, descriptive, cross-sectional study between 26th June and 26th July 2021 using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods among students of Busitema University in Eastern Uganda. The survey assessed anxiety levels of students using General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale, and its associations using the Chi-Square or Fischers exact test and multivariate logistic regression. We also explored the challenges and coping strategies employed by students through in-depth interviews. Results A total of 338 students participated, 213 (63%) were male with median age of 23 years (21C25), majority from Faculty of health sciences (n = 153, 45%). Overall, 179 (53%) of the students had anxiety which was mostly mild anxiety (n = 127, 38%). Students concerned about inadequate internet facilities to support online learning were twice more likely to have anxiety (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1C3.7; p = 0.021). Among those with anxiety, avoidance coping strategies had higher scores with a median of 8 (3C12) compared to other strategies (p < 0.001).

However, a major challenge that has limited the effectiveness of current vaccine candidates is the extensive global diversity of HIV-1 Env, the sole target for HIV-neutralizing antibodies. To address this challenge, a variety of strategies to incorporate Env diversity into the vaccine formulation have been proposed. Here, we assessed the potential of two such strategies that utilize a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses. The nanoparticle immunogens developed here consisted of different formulations of Envs from strains BG505 (clade A) and CZA97 (clade C), attached to the N-termini of bacterial ferritin. Single-antigen nanoparticle cocktails as well as mosaic nanoparticles bearing both Env trimers elicited high antibody titers in mice and guinea pigs. Furthermore, serum from guinea pigs immunized with nanoparticle immunogens achieved autologous, and in some cases heterologous, tier 2 neutralization, although significant differences between mosaic and single-antigen nanoparticles were not observed.

The folate receptor (FR) is known to be overexpressed extracellularly on a variety of human cancers and is therefore an outstanding gate for tumor-targeted Trojan horse-like delivery of therapeutics. In this study, an amphiphilic and biodegradable ternary copolymer conjugated with folate as ligand, polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol) was synthesized and evaluated for targeted siRNA delivery via folate-FR recognition. The amphiphilic character of similar polymers was shown previously to support endosomal release of endocytosed nanocarriers and to promote formation of long circulating micelles. The obtained PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol exhibited less cytotoxicity in comparison with the corresponding ternary copolymer without folate (PEI-PCL-PEG) and with unmodified PEI25kDa. Stable micelle-like polyplexes with hydrodynamic diameters about 100 nm were found to have a zeta potential of +8.6 mV, which was lower than that of micelleplexes without folate-conjugation (+13-16 mV). Nonetheless, increased cellular uptake and in vitro gene knockdown of PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes were observed in SKOV-3 cells, an FR overexpressing cell line, in comparison with the nonfolate-conjugated ones. Moreover, PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol/siRNA micelleplexes exhibited excellent stability in vivo during the analysis of 120 min and a longer circulation half life than hyPEI25kDa/siRNA polyplexes. Most interestingly, the targeted delivery system yielded 17% deposition of the i.v. injected siRNA per gram in the tumor after 24 h due to the effective folate targeting and the prolonged circulation.","output":"Efficient and Tumor Targeted siRNA Delivery by Polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEI-PCL-PEG-Fol)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The core claim of this article is that critical criminology offers us an especially potent framework for interpreting state-corporate crime with the health care industry in the United States as one illustrative case, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.

METHODS This parallel mixed-methods study used both FLS scoring data and participant feedback to determine the barriers to feasibility of remote proctoring for the FLS examination. Participants were tested at two accredited FLS testing centers. An official FLS proctor administered and scored the FLS exam remotely while another onsite proctor provided a live score of participants' performance. Participant feedback was collected during testing. Interrater reliabilities of onsite and remote FLS scoring data were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Participant feedback was analyzed using modified grounded theory to identify themes for barriers to feasibility. RESULTS The scores of the remote and onsite proctors showed excellent interrater reliability in the total FLS (ICC 0.995, CI [0.985-0.998]). Several barriers led to critical errors in remote scoring, but most were accompanied by a solution incorporated into the study protocol.

Patients were dichotomized into those with reduced ejection fraction (EF; <50%) and preserved EF (&#8805;50%). RESULTS: Across our 11-hospital system, 5032 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19 from March-September 2020. Of these, 235 had evidence of myocardial injury (troponin &#8805;1 ng/mL). Included were 134 patients who underwent TTE, of whom 43.3% (n = 58) had reduced EF and 56.7% (n = 76) preserved EF.

Herein, oxyresveratrol was isolated from ethanolic crude extracts of Artocarpus lacucha Buch.-Ham., and chemically modified to derive its lipophilic analogues. Biological screening assays showed their inhibitory potency against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with very low cytotoxicity to the MRC-5 normal cell lines. At the catalytic site of COX-2, docking protocols with ChemPLP, GoldScore and AutoDock scoring functions were carried out to reveal hydrogen bonding interactions with key polar contacts and hydrophobic pi-interactions. For more accurate binding energetics, COX-2/ligand complexes at the binding region were computed in vacuo and implicit aqueous solvation using M06-2X density functional with 6-31G+(d,p) basis set. Our computational results confirmed that dihydrooxyresveratrol (4) is the putative inhibitor of human COX-2 with the highest inhibitory activity (IC(50) of 11.50  1.54 M) among studied non-fluorinated analogues for further lead optimization. Selective substitution of fluorine provides a stronger binding affinity; however, lowering the cytotoxicity of a fluorinated analogue to a normal cell is challenging.

Health care workers were faced with a disease that led to significant morbidity and mortality with no proven therapies. As hospitals became inundated with patients and underwent rapid expansion of capacity, resources such as drugs, protective and medical equipment, and hospital staff became limited. Pharmacists played a critical role in the management of clinical care and drug delivery during the pandemic. As members of the department of pharmacy within NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, we describe our experiences and processes to overcome challenges faced during the pandemic. Strict inventory management through the use of daily usage reports, frequent communication, and minimization of waste was critical for the management of drug shortages. The creation of guidelines, protocols, and restrictions were not only used to mitigate drug shortages, but also helped educate health care providers and guided medication use. Managing technology through setting up new automatic dispensing cabinets to address hospital expansions and modifying the electronic order entry system to include new protocols and drug shortage information were also vital. Additional key pharmacist functions included provision of investigational drug service support and training of pharmacists, prescribers, nurses, and respiratory therapists to educate and standardize medication use. Through implementation of operational and clinical processes, pharmacists managed critical drug inventory and guided patient treatment.

Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily. CT diagnostic performance were calculated and variations between phases were tested for equivalence or difference using Bayesian methods. RESULTS: 2194 consecutive chest CT were analyzed. Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists.

However, decision-making in neurocritical care is hindered by limited accessibility of neuroimaging and radiological interpretation. We evaluated an artificial intelligence (AI) system for use in conjunction with bedside portable point-of-care (POC)-MRI to automatically measure midline shift (MLS), a quantitative biomarker of stroke severity. Materials and Methods: POC-MRI (0.064 T) was acquired in a patient cohort (n=94) in the Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of an academic medical center in the follow-up window during treatment for ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS). A deep-learning architecture was applied to produce AI estimates of midline shift (MLS-AI). Neuroradiologist annotations for MLS were compared to MLS-AI using non-inferiority testing. Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between MLS-AI and stroke severity (NIHSS) and functional disability (mRS) at imaging time and discharge, and the predictive value of MLS-AI versus clinical outcome was evaluated. Results: MLS-AI was non-inferior to neuroradiologist estimates of MLS (p<1e-5). MLS-AI measurements were associated with stroke severity (NIHSS) near the time of imaging in all patients (p<0.005) and within the IS subgroup (p=0.005). In multivariate analysis, larger MLS-AI at the time of imaging was associated with significantly worse outcome at the time of discharge in all patients and in the IS subgroup (p<0.05).

METHODS: Serum samples (n = 114) from 34 COVID-19 patients with mild to critical clinical manifestations were examined. The presence and titers of IgG antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were determined by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) using Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and by an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test. RESULTS: IgG was detected by the CMIA in 40%, 88%, and 100% of samples collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and 2 weeks after symptom onset in severe and critical cases, and 0%, 38%, and 100% in mild/moderate cases, respectively. In severe and critical cases, the positive IgG detection rate with the IC assay was 60% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks. In mild/moderate cases, the positive IgG rate was 17% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks; IgM was positive in 80% and 75% of severe and critical cases, and 42% and 88% of mild/moderate cases, respectively. On the CMIA, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in COVID-19 outpatients with mild symptoms within 10 days from onset, whereas 50% of samples from severe inpatients were IgG-positive in the same period.

Carotid technologies addressed include the carotid stents themselves as well as adjunct neuroprotective devices. Aspects of stent technology include bare-metal versus covered stents, stent tapering, and free-cell area. Drug-eluting and cutting balloon indications are described. Embolization protection options and new direct carotid access strategies are reviewed. Adjunct technologies, such as intravascular ultrasound imaging and risk stratification algorithms, are discussed. Bare-metal and covered stents provide unique advantages and disadvantages. Stent tapering may allow for a more fitted contour to the caliber decrement between the common carotid and internal carotid arteries but also introduces new technical challenges. Studies regarding free-cell area are conflicting with respect to benefits and associated risk; clinical relevance of associated adverse effects associated with either type is unclear. Embolization protection strategies include distal filter protection and flow reversal. Though flow reversal was initially met with some skepticism, it has gained wider acceptance and may provide the advantage of not crossing the carotid lesion before protection is established. New direct carotid access techniques address difficult anatomy and incorporate sophisticated flow-reversal embolization protection techniques.

Using body mass index (BMI) as a proxy, previous Mendelian randomization studies revealed general obesity potentially causes PCOS. Central obesity frequently demonstrates a stronger association with PCOS, although evidence on its causality is sparse. Objectives To investigate causal effects of both central- and general- obesity on the development of PCOS via two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR). Methods Summary GWAS data of female-only, large-sample cohorts of European ancestry were retrieved for anthropometric markers of central obesity (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) and general obesity (BMI and its constituent variables - weight and height), from the IEU Open GWAS Project. As the outcome data, we acquired summary data from a large-sample GWAS (96391 samples; 219 cases and 96172 controls) from the FinnGen cohort. Four 2SMR methods were applied: inverse variance weighted (IVW); MR Egger (MRE); weighted median (WME); weighted mode (WMO). Single SNP-, leave-one-out-, heterogeneity-, horizontal pleiotropy- and outlier- analyses were conducted. Genetic architectures underlying causal associations were explored. Results All SNPs selected as instrumental variables demonstrated no weak instrument bias (F > 10). Three anthropometric exposures, namely, BMI (OR: 5.55 - 7.24, WC (OR: 6.79 - 24.56), and HC (OR: 6.78 - 24.56), significantly causally associated with PCOS as per IVW, WME, and WMO models. Single SNP- and leave-one-out- sensitivity analysis results were indicative of robust causal estimates. No significant heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and outliers were observed. We observed a considerable degree of overlap (7 SNPs; 17 genes) across significant causal findings as well as a number of SNPs and genes that were not shared between causal associations. Conclusions This study revealed that both and general- and central obesity potentially cause PCOS. Findings underscore the importance of addressing obesity and adiposity for the prevention and management of PCOS.","output":"Both general- and central- obesity are causally associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome: Findings of a Mendelian randomization study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the lockdown, various changes of dietary habits are observed, including both positive and negative ones.

The study was conducted in May 2020, based on the random quota sampling of schools (for voivodeships and counties) and a number of 2448 students from all the regions of Poland participated. The Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) (36 items) was applied twice-to analyze separately current choices (during the period of COVID-19 pandemic) and general choices (when there was no COVID-19 pandemic). For both the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, sensory appeal and price were indicated as the most important factors (with the highest scores). However, differences were observed between the scores of specific factors, while health (p < 0.0001) and weight control (p < 0.0001) were declared as more important during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the period before, but mood (p < 0.0001) and sensory appeal (p < 0.0001) as less important.

The present cross-sectional study aims to investigate the perceived risk and protective behaviors regarding COVID-19 among pregnant women, in Hamadan, Iran. Using a two-stage cluster sampling method, 225 pregnant women referring to the health centers completed the questionnaires. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests as well as a stepwise linear regression model at 95% confidence level. RESULTS: 93.8% of pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, 97.3% had a high performance in protective behaviors, and 72.9% had a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. The highest mean score of knowledge was observed in women who had a history of influenza in their previous pregnancies (90.97  5.94). The mean score of protective behaviors was significantly higher in women with a high economic level (97.78  5.11), and the highest level of risk perception was observed in nulliparous women (59.97  9.80). Risk perception was an independent predictor of protective behaviors related to COVID-19 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, high performance in protective behaviors, and a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. History of influenza in previous pregnancies, high economic level, and nulliparity were associated with higher levels of knowledge, protective behaviors, and risk perception, respectively.

METHOD Multivariable logistic regression was applied to a dataset of 61,861 people with asthma from England and Scotland using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. External validation was performed using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank of 174,240 patients from Wales. Outcomes were one or more hospitalisation (development dataset) and asthma-related hospitalisation, A&E attendance or death (validation dataset) within a 12-month period. RESULTS Risk factors for asthma-related crisis events included previous hospitalisation, older age, underweight, smoking and blood eosinophilia. The prediction algorithm had acceptable predictive ability with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) of 0.71 (0.70, 0.72) in the validation dataset. Using a cut-point based on the 7% of the population at greatest risk results in a positive predictive value of 5.7% (95% CI 5.3 - 6.1) and a negative predictive value of 98.9% (98.9 - 99.0), with sensitivity of 28.5% (26.7 - 30.3) and specificity of 93.3% (93.2 - 93.4); they had an event risk of 6.0% compared 1.1% for the remaining population.

However, the role of sphingolipids in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Here, we assessed several inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism enzymes against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection in vitro . Among the compounds tested, only N -(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR, also known as fenretinide), an inhibitor of dihydroceramide 4-desaturase 1 (DES1) and well known for having antitumour activity, suppressed cell-cell fusion (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ] = 4.1 M) and viral infection ([EC 50 ] = 4.4 M), wherein the EC 50 values are below its plasma concentration in previous clinical trials on tumours. DES1 catalyses the introduction of a double bond in dihydroceramide, and the inhibition efficiencies observed were consistent with an increased ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to total sphingolipids and the decreased cellular membrane fluidity. These findings, together with the accumulated clinical data regarding the safety of 4-HPR, make it a likely candidate drug to treat COVID-19.","output":"N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)retinamide suppresses SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many healthcare professionals are being faced with the question of what is considered to be an essential service.

Two undergraduate cohorts received teaching on the Mental State Examination, either socially-distanced delivered by traditional powerpoint or remotely by mind-mapping software on a tablet hand-held digital device. We required an effective program which would retain the popular interactive elements of Psychiatry teaching and promote inclusivity across students' diverse learning styles. METHOD: Two cohorts of Year 2 students from the Universities of Dundee and St Andrew's Scottish Graduate-Entry Medicine (scotGEM) course took part in an Introduction to Psychiatry seminar which involved a presentation of the Mental State Examination. One was conducted in a face-to-face setting via traditional PowerPoint. The second was conducted via remote-conferencing with mindmaps of key concepts drawn and screen-shared live to students as teaching progressed. This was a qualitative study, with online links to questionnaires for 24 student participants across 5 domains. (1. The tutorial met my learning objectives, 2. The format was suitable for me, 3. The balance of theory and cases was suitable for me, 4. The tutorial was of appropriate length, 5.

A close association between obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance has been identified, and many studies have pinpointed obesity as a causal risk factor for insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying this association is not entirely understood. In the past decade, ceramides have gained attention due to their accumulation in certain tissues and their suggested role in initiating insulin resistance. This study aims to determine the association of specific ceramides and their major metabolizing enzymes with obesity-associated insulin resistance. METHODS The samples comprised subcutaneous adipose tissues collected from three cohorts: lean non-diabetic (controls; n = 20), obese-non-diabetic (n = 66), and obese-diabetic (n = 32). Ceramide levels were quantified using LC-MS/MS and mRNA expression level for different enzymes were estimated using real-time PCR-based RNA expression analysis. RESULTS C16-ceramide (P = 0.023), C16-dihydro-ceramide (P < 0.005), C18-dihydro-ceramide (P = 0.009) and C24-ceramide (P = 0.040) levels were significantly increased in the obese cohort compared to the control group. However, stratification of the obese group revealed a significant increase in the C16-ceramide levels (P = 0.027) and mRNA over expression of the serine palmitoyl transferases enzyme subunit SPT1 (P < 0.005) in the obese-diabetic cohort compared to the obese-non-diabetic cohort. CONCLUSIONS The present study indicates that C16-ceramide plays a pivotal role in inducing insulin resistance. Overexpression of SPT1 in the obese-diabetic group and its positive correlation with C16-ceramide suggest that C16-ceramide was generated through the de novo pathway.","output":"Insulin resistance induced by de novo pathway-generated C16-ceramide is associated with type 2 diabetes in an obese population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a machine learning method for mapping potential earthquake source zones (ESZ).

Participants: 12,217 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 20 May 2020, including 171 patients (1.4%) who received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for sex, age, obesity, current smoking status, any medical condition associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, and clinical and biological severity of COVID-19 at admission, while stratifying by the need of respiratory support (i.e., oxygen or intubation). The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model and the secondary analysis used a univariate Cox regression in a matched analytic sample. Results: Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 10 patients (15.9%) who received dexamethasone and 298 patients (26.4%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in both the crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.87, p=0.021) and the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.96, p=0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample yielded a same tendency, albeit non-significant (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.14, p=0.077). Among patients without respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 14 patients (13.0%) who received dexamethasone and 1,086 patients (10.0%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. When examining the association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone received during the visit and the endpoint, we found that the administration of a cumulative dose between 60 mg to 150 mg among patients who required respiratory support was significantly associated with a lower risk of death in the crude, unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.28; SE, 0.58, p=0.028), the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.24; SE, 0.65, p=0.030), and in the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample (HR, 0.32; SE, 0.58, p=0.048), whereas no significant association was observed with a different dose. Among patients without respiratory support, there was no significant association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone and the endpoint in the crude and in the adjusted multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with decreased mortality among those requiring respiratory support.","output":"Dexamethasone use and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: a Multicenter Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initiatives to optimise preconception health are emerging following growing recognition that this may improve the health and well-being of women and men of reproductive age and optimise health in their children.

This study aims to evaluate changes in domain-specific (i.e. leisure time, transportation, occupational, and household) and total PA due to the Dutch COVID-19 lockdown, which started on March 15 2020. Furthermore, we aim to identify demographic, health-related, and psychological correlates of these changes. METHODS: Individuals who participated in the Nijmegen Exercise Study during 2017-2019 were invited to this study, which was conducted between April 16 and May 12 2020. Participant characteristics (i.e. age, sex, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education, household composition, and occupation status), living environment (i.e. housing type and degree of urbanization), psychological characteristics (i.e. resilience, outcome expectations, vitality, and mental health), and medical history were collected via an online questionnaire. Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity was used to assess PA behavior before and during lockdown. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare PA levels, in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per week (min/wk), before and during lockdown. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to examine correlates of PA changes. RESULTS: 4033 participants (57% male; 59  13 years) were included. PA decreased significantly during lockdown with mean  SD changes of 393  2735 MET-min/wk for total, 133  785 MET-min/wk for transportation, 137  1469 MET-min/wk for occupation, and 136  1942 MET-min/wk for leisure time PA. Household PA did not change significantly. Unemployment, COVID-19-related occupational changes, higher BMI, and living in an apartment or semi-detached/terraced house were significantly related to larger decreases in total and domain-specific PA. Higher vitality was related to smaller decreases in total and domain-specific PA. Higher age was significantly associated with a larger decrease in leisure time PA. Lower education was associated with smaller decreases in transportation and occupational PA compared to higher education. CONCLUSION: PA levels significantly reduced during lockdown compared to before lockdown.

Little is known about the impact of nursing facility COVID-19 on the local health system. METHODS: We collected data of COVID-19 cases in Nagasaki city from April 15, 2020 to June 30, 2021. We performed universal screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) and the users of nursing facilities, once the first case of COVID-19 was detected within that facility. The community-dwelling people received testing if they had symptoms or if they were suspected of having close contact with the positive cases. The epidemiological survey for each COVID-19 case was performed by the public health officers of the local public health center. RESULTS: Out of 111,773 community-dwelling older adults (age [Formula: see text] 65 years) and 20,668 nursing facility users in Nagasaki city, we identified 358 and 71 COVID-19 cases, and 33 and 12 COVID-19 deaths, respectively, during the study period. The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for COVID-19 and its deaths among the nursing facility users were 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.82C1.39) and 1.97 (95%CI, 0.92C3.91) compared with the community-dwelling older adults. Four clusters, which had more than 10 COVID-19 cases, accounted for 60% (65/109) of the overall cases by the HCWs and the users. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention of COVID-19 clusters is important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the nursing facility population.","output":"Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing facilities and the impact of their clusters in a Japanese core city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cell metabolic activation plays a crucial role in inflammation of atherosclerosis. Shikonin (SKN), a natural naphthoquinone with anti-inflammatory activity, has shown to exert cardioprotective effects, but the effect of SKN on atherosclerosis is unclear. In addition, SKN was found to inhibit glycolysis via targeting pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2). In the present study, we investigated the effects of SKN on hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis and T cell inflammatory activation in ApoE(?/?) mice and the metabolic mechanisms in this process. Drinking water supplemented with Hcy (1.8 g/L) was administered to ApoE(?/?) mice for 2 weeks and the mice were injected with SKN (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle every 3 days. We showed that SKN treatment markedly attenuated HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE(?/?) mice and significantly decreased inflammatory activated CD4(+) T cells and proinflammatory macrophages in plaques. In splenic CD4(+) T cells isolated from HHcy-ApoE(?/?) mice, SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated PKM2 activity, interferon- secretion and the capacity of these T cells to promote macrophage proinflammatory polarization. SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated CD4(+) T cell glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic profiling analysis of CD4(+) T cells revealed that Hcy administration significantly increased various glucose metabolites as well as lipids and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which were reversed by SKN treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that SKN is effective to ameliorate atherosclerosis in HHcy-ApoE(?/?) mice and this is at least partly associated with the inhibition of SKN on CD4(+) T cell inflammatory activation via PKM2-dependent metabolic suppression.","output":"Shikonin attenuates hyperhomocysteinemia-induced CD4(+) T cell inflammatory activation and atherosclerosis in ApoE(?/?) mice by metabolic suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current formulations and dose regimens of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) put patients at risk of harm.

Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months.

To achieve that, microfabricated Cu electrodes on a printed circuit board modified with the conducting polymer poly(3-octylthiophene) (POT) have been employed as a substrate. This polymer was introduced to enhance the stability of the potential drift (0.9 mV/h) and improve the limit of detection (0.126 nmol mL-1). Nernstian potentiometric response was achieved for DZP over the concentration range 1.0  10-2 to 5.0  10-7 mol L-1 with a slope of 55.0  0.4 mV/decade and E0 ~ 478.9  0.9.

We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515. Findings: Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 710% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (17%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 79  06 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (737%, n = 488), and vomiting (683%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal.

The objective of this review was to synthesise qualitative and quantitative research on university students' menstrual experiences and educational impacts. METHODS Eligible studies were identified through systematic searching across eight peer-reviewed databases, websites for menstrual health organisations, grey literature databases, and reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies must have reported on at least one of the antecedents or components of menstrual experience outlined in the integrated model of menstrual experience in relation to university students or reported on the impact of their menstrual experiences on their education. Study characteristics and findings were extracted, analysed and presented as a narrative synthesis. The quality of evidence was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42020178470. RESULTS Eighty-three studies were eligible for inclusion. Most studies (n = 74; 89%) were quantitative and the highest proportion of studies were conducted in lower-middle-income countries (n = 31; 37%). Self-reported dysmenorrhea, other physical and emotional menstrual-related symptoms, and menstrual stigma contributed to negative menstrual experiences among female students. Very few studies considered the menstrual experiences of non-binary and transgender menstruating students, and culturally diverse students. Dysmenorrhea contributed to university absenteeism, impaired participation and concentration, and declining academic performance. Inadequate sanitation facilities for menstrual management and challenges containing menstruation also negatively impacted education.

Yet, the vast majority of chemogenetic studies have focused on acute applications, while repeated, long-term neuromodulation has only been booming in the past few years. Unfortunately, together with the rising number of studies, various hurdles have also been uncovered, especially in relation to its chronic application. It becomes increasingly clear that chronic neuromodulation warrants caution and that the effects of acute neuromodulation cannot be extrapolated towards chronic experiments. Deciphering the underlying cellular and molecular causes of these discrepancies could truly unlock the chronic chemogenetic toolbox and possibly even pave the way for chemogenetics towards clinical application. Indeed, we are only scratching the surface of what is possible with chemogenetic research. For example, most investigations are concentrated on behavioral read-outs, whereas dissecting the underlying molecular signature after (chronic) neuromodulation could reveal novel insights in terms of basic neuroscience and deregulated neural circuits.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been associated with de novo and worsening GERD following surgery. For this reason, patients who suffer from GERD and are considering bariatric surgery are often counseled to undergo gastric bypass. Given this practice, we sought to determine acid reduction medication (ARM) utilization in bariatric surgical patients who undergo one of these procedures prior to surgery and at 1 year following surgery. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively maintained data on patients to undergo gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy between November 2012 and December 2014 was conducted after IRB approval. ARM utilization and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) scores [range 0 (no symptoms)-50 (severe GERD)] were compared prior to surgery and at 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS 334 patients underwent an eligible procedure in the study interval. 147 patients (44 %) had data on both preoperative and 1 year postoperative ARM use (93 gastric bypass and 54 sleeve gastrectomy). ARM utilization prior to surgery in gastric bypass patients did not reach statistical significance when compared to sleeve gastrectomy (40.9 vs. 26 %, p = 0.07). GERD-HRQL scores were greater prior to surgery in gastric bypass patients (GERD-HRQL 8.2 vs. 1.9; p < 0.01). At 12 months postoperatively, sleeve gastrectomy patients had a significantly higher rate of overall ARM use (48.1 vs. 16.1 %, p < 0.01), new ARM use (35 vs. 7.3 %, p < 0.01), and persistent ARM use (78.6 vs. 21.9 %, p < 0.01) when compared to gastric bypass patients. GERD-HRQL scores were similar overall at 12 months postoperatively (4.4 bypass vs. 4.8 sleeve; p = 0.72). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a significantly increased likelihood that acid reduction medications will be necessary for GERD symptom control 12 months postoperatively when compared to gastric bypass.","output":"GERD and acid reduction medication use following gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aerospace industry must increase air transport resistance against health threats and regain passenger confidence.

However, these instruments are not specifically designed for facial signs. OBJECTIVES To develop and validate a specific questionnaire to assess the burden on patients with facial signs of systemic sclerosis and which we have named \\"Burden of Face Affected\\" (BoFA). METHODS BoFA was developed using standard methodology in 3 phases: exploration, development and validation. In all, 197 patients completed questionnaires. We analysed the degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's ) and external validity between BoFA and the 12-Item Short Form Healthy Survey (SF-12), the Mouth Handicap In Systemic Sclerosis Scale (MHISS), Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). To assess reproducibility, a test-retest analysis was conducted. The original French version was translated into English and underwent cultural validation. RESULTS The questionnaire comprises 20 items grouped into 4 dimensions. BoFA showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's : 0.93). External validity was demonstrated in terms of good correlation between BoFA and other questionnaires, in particular MHISS (r=0.54). The test-retest analysis demonstrated good reproducibility (0.92). The BoFA score varied significantly according to the severity of facial scleroderma as assessed by the patients themselves. DISCUSSION Facial involvement in systemic sclerosis may be considered by physicians to be a minor consequence of the disease and is often overlooked. Nevertheless, it is crucial for patients' quality of life. A number of studies have assessed the impact of facial signs on health-related quality of life using instruments such as DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), SWAP (Satisfaction With Appearance Scale), Brief SWAP and SSPRO (Scleroderma Skin Patient-Reported Outcome). However, these are not specific for facial signs and focus on other sites. BoFA has good reliability and construct validity, and it assesses disability specifically involving the face in patients with systemic sclerosis. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, BoFA is the first specific tool for assessing burden in patients with facial scleroderma. It is an easy-to-use tool for evaluating the burden of facial signs and may also be used to assess the degree of burden before and after treatment.","output":"[Development and validation of a questionnaire to assess facial handicap in systemic sclerosis]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Puntos para una lectura rpida: ?

The base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative DNA damage. Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes include hOgg1, hMYH, hNTH and hMTH. METHODS: The above lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) using the pSF91.1 retroviral vector. Cells were exposed to a 95% oxygen environment, ionizing radiation (IR), or H(2)O(2). Cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05. RESULTS: Cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hMYH had improved survival to both increased oxygen and IR. Cell growth analysis of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hMYH also grow at a slower rate. Western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others. However, it was observed that O(2 )toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hNTH in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH in A549 cells exposed to O(2 )and IR leads to improvements in cell survival. DNA repair through the base excision repair pathway may provide an alternative way to offset the damaging effects of O(2 )and its metabolites.","output":"Protection of pulmonary epithelial cells from oxidative stress by hMYH adenine glycosylase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 variants has become a major challenge of the current fight against the pandemic. Of particular concerns are the strains that have arisen from the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa.

Potential false-negative diagnosis using currently available antigen kits that may not recognize these variants could cause another wave of community infection.

On one hand, biased algorithms on social media platforms may filter out posts from individuals in stigmatized groups and concentrate exposure to content that perpetuates problematic norms about weight. Individuals may also be more likely to engage in attacks due to increased anonymity and lack of substantive consequences online. The critical influence of social media in shaping beliefs may also lead to the internalization of weight stigma. However, social media could also be used as a positive agent of change. Movements such as Body Positivity, the Fatosphere, and Health at Every Size have helped counter negative stereotypes and provide more inclusive spaces. To support these efforts, governments should continue to explore legislative solutions to enact anti-weight discrimination policies, and platforms should invest in diverse content moderation teams with dedicated weight bias training while interrogating bias in existing algorithms. Public health practitioners and clinicians should leverage social media as a tool in weight management interventions and increase awareness of stigmatizing online content among their patients.

Whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increase the risk for severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We sought to address this question using two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis approaches in large cohorts. Methods We performed large-scale TSMR analyses to examine whether there is a causal relationship between NAFLD, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), grade of steatosis, NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), or fibrosis stage and severe COVID-19. To maximize the power of this analysis, we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis (GWMA) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NAFLD. We also examined the impact of 20 major co-morbid factors of NAFLD on severe COVID-19. Results Univariate analysis of the UK Biobank (UKB) data demonstrated a significant association between NAFLD and severe COVID-19 (OR=3.06, p=1.0710?6). However, this association disappeared after demographic and co-morbid factors adjusted (OR=1.61, p=0.08). TSMR study indicated that NAFLD (OR=0.97, p=0.61), ALT level (OR=1.03, p=0.47), grade of steatosis (OR=1.08, p=0.41), NAS (OR=1.02, p=0.39), and fibrosis stage (OR=1.01, p=0.87) were not associated with severe COVID-19. Among all NAFLD-related co-morbid factors, BMI (OR=1.73, p=7.6510?9), waist circumference (WC, OR=1.76, p=2.5810?5), and hip circumference (HC, OR=1.33, p=7.2610?3) were the only ones demonstrated a causal impact on severe COVID-19. Conclusions There is no evidence supporting that NAFLD is a causal risk factor for severe COVID-19.

The fungi are found in the arid desert soils of the southwestern US, as well as in parts of Mexico and Central and South America. Acquisition is typically via inhalation of arthroconidia which become airborne after both natural (e.g., earthquakes, dust storms, and fires) and human-related events (e.g., military maneuvers, recreational activities, agriculture, and construction). The incidence of infection in increasing likely a result of both climatic and populational changes. Further, the recognized geographic distribution of Coccidioides spp. is expanding, as cases are being diagnosed in new areas (e.g., eastern Washington, Oregon, and Utah). Most coccidioidal infections are asymptomatic (60%); however, approximately one-third develop a pulmonary illness which is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in highly endemic areas. Uncommonly (0.5C2% of cases), the infection disseminates to extrapulmonary locations (e.g., skin, bones/joints, and the central nervous system), and is most commonly seen among persons with cellular immunodeficiencies (e.g., transplant recipients, HIV, and pregnancy) and non-Caucasian races (especially African Americans and Filipinos). The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis requires astute clinical suspicion and laboratory findings, including positive serology, cultures, and/or histopathology results. Treatment is warranted among persons with pneumonia who have risk factors for complicated disease and among those with extrapulmonary disease. Novel antifungals with improved fungicidal activity and rapidity of action with fewer side effects and drug interactions are needed. Preventive strategies (e.g., education regarding the disease, dust avoidance, mask wearing, including among select groups, antifungal prophylaxis, and surveillance laboratory testing) are advised for residents and travelers to endemic areas.

The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real-time RT-PCR-positive on various time-points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS-CoV-2 titres (> 7 Log10 copies/swab) on the first sampling time-point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real-time RT-PCR-positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx.

We applied this approach to a longitudinal panel of 164 counties throughout the United States, covering a 4-week interval ending in the first week of January 2022. Within this panel, we estimated that COVID incidence has been rising exponentially at a rate of 9.34% per day (95% CI, 8.93-9.87). Assuming that only one-quarter of all recent Omicron infections have been reported by public authorities, we further estimated the aggregate prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first week of January to be 4.89%. During the same week, among 250 high-COVID-volume hospitals within our 164-county panel, an estimated 1 in 4 inpatients was COVID-positive. Among such COVID-positive hospitalized patients, 15.2% were estimated to be incidental infections. Across individual counties, the median fraction of incidental COVID hospitalizations was 13.7%, with an interquartile range of 9.5 to 18.4%. Incidental COVID infections appear to be a nontrivial fraction of all COVID-positive hospitalized patients. In the aggregate, however, the burden of patients admitted for complications of their viral infections appears to be far greater.","output":"Estimated Fraction of Incidental COVID Hospitalizations in a Cohort of 250 High-Volume Hospitals Located in 164 Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A phenomenon known for over 100 years named cell-in-cell (CIC) is now undergoing its renaissance, mostly due to modern cell visualization techniques. It is no longer an esoteric process studied by a few cell biologists, as there is increasing evidence that CICs may have prognostic and diagnostic value for cancer patients. There are many unresolved questions stemming from the difficulties in studying CICs and the limitations of current molecular techniques. CIC formation involves a dynamic interaction between an outer or engulfing cell and an inner or engulfed cell, which can be of the same (homotypic) or different kind (heterotypic). Either one of those cells appears to be able to initiate this process, which involves signaling through cellCcell adhesion, followed by cytoskeleton activation, leading to the deformation of the cellular membrane and movements of both cells that subsequently result in CICs. This review focuses on the distinction of five known forms of CIC (cell cannibalism, phagoptosis, enclysis, entosis, and emperipolesis), their unique features, characteristics, and underlying molecular mechanisms.","output":"Classification of Cell-in-Cell Structures: Different Phenomena with Similar Appearance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is unclear whether HIV infection is associated with risk of COVID-19 death. We aimed to investigate this in a large-scale population-based study in England. Methods: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared to people without HIV. COVID-19 death was defined by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death, initially adjusted for age and sex, then adding adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and finally for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and calendar time. Results: 17.3 million adults were included, of whom 27,480 (0.16%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. There were 14,882 COVID-19 deaths during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had nearly three-fold higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex (HR=2.90, 95% CI 1.96-4.30). The association was attenuated but risk remained substantially raised, after adjustment for deprivation and ethnicity (adjusted HR=2.52, 1.70-3.73) and further adjustment for comorbidities (HR=2.30, 1.55-3.41). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of black ethnicity (HR = 3.80, 2.15-6.74, compared to 1.64, 0.92-2.90 in non-black individuals, p-interaction=0.045) Interpretation: HIV infection was associated with a markedly raised risk of COVID-19 death in a country with high levels of antiretroviral therapy coverage and viral suppression; the association was larger in people of black ethnicity.","output":"HIV infection and COVID-19 death: population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care data and linked national death registrations within the OpenSAFELY platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore return to work after COVID-19 and how disease severity affects this. STUDY DESIGN: This is a Nationwide Danish registryCbased cohort study using a retrospective follow-up design.

Admission types (i.e. no admission, admission to nonCintensive care unit [ICU] department and admission to ICU) and return to work was investigated using Cox regression standardised to the age, sex, comorbidity and education-level distribution of all included subjects with estimates at 3 months from positive test displayed. RESULTS: Among the 7466 patients included in the study, 81.9% (6119/7466) and 98.4% (7344/7466) returned to work within 4 weeks and 6 months, respectively, with 1.5% (109/7466) not returning. Of the patients admitted, 72.1% (627/870) and 92.6% (805/870) returned 1 month and 6 months after admission to the hospital, with 6.6% (58/870) not returning within 6 months. Of patients admitted to the ICU, 36% (9/25) did not return within 6 months. Patients with an admission had a lower chance of return to work 3 months from positive test (relative risk [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94C0.96), with the lowest chance in patients admitted to an ICU department (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35C0.72).

The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAK-STAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Activation of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor Ace2 by cytokines through pan JAK-STAT enhancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause acute upper respiratory illness.

The background of HRV PCR positivity in symptom-free individuals (30/139 [22%]) was only slightly lower than in those with respiratory illness (28/77 [36%]). For subjects with multiple samples, it was estimated that HRV was detectable by PCR for approximately 100 days before, during, and after clinical symptoms were documented. PCR is a remarkably more sensitive method of detecting HRV than is tissue culture. The presence of HRV RNA may not always reflect an association with infectious virus production.

In this study, we aimed to comprehensively analyze the prognostic significance of baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in melanoma patients with immunotherapy. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library until September 16, 2020. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled to investigate the association of baseline NLR with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Sensitivity analysis, subgroup analyses, publication bias assessment, and the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method were used to evaluate the stability of results. A total of 18 studies including 2054 patients were included in our analysis. Pooled data demonstrated that higher baseline NLR was associated with a poorer OS (HR=2.46, 95% CI=1.77, 3.43) and PFS (HR=2.38, 95% CI=1.95, 2.89) of melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy. Subgroup analysis according to immunotherapy type showed that the prognostic effects of baseline NLR existed in all the subtypes of immunotherapy, including anticytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy (OS HR=2.26, 95% CI=1.43, 3.59; PFS HR=2.68, 95% CI=1.79, 4.02), antiprogrammed cell death-1 therapy (OS HR=3.08, 95% CI=2.21, 4.27; PFS HR=2.01, 95% CI=1.64, 2.47), and combination therapy (OS HR=1.75, 95% CI=1.13, 2.72; PFS HR=3.13, 95% CI=1.63, 6.03). Conclusions were still consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by study year, region, study type, sample size, analysis of HR and cuttoff of baseline NLR.

There is still limited data comparing their respective long-term efficacy (>1 year). This study sought to compare the very long-term outcomes of AVNRT ablation using radiofrequency or cryotherapy. METHODS We retrospectively included all patients who had undergone a first AVNRT ablation in our institution between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was recurrence of documented AVNRT. RESULTS The study population consisted of 409 patients (274 females, mean age 49.9 year-old). Ablation was performed using cryoenergy in 260 patients and radiofrequency in 149. High acute procedural success rate (> 98%) was obtained and no permanent AV block was observed using both techniques. During a mean follow-up of 3.32.3 years, documented AVNRT reccurence occurred in 24 (9.2%) and 4 patients (2.7%) in the cryoablation and radiofrequency group respectively. The risk of AVNRT recurrence was significantly higher in the CA group as compared to the RF group (Hazard Ratio = 3.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9). Most of the recurrences after cryoablation occurred between 1- and 6-year follow-up (14/24; 58.3%), with 1/3rd of late recurrences after 3-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, only Koch's triangle anatomical variant was associated with AVNRT recurrence after cryoablation (Hazard Ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 2.7-16.3). CONCLUSION While AVNRT recurrence rates were similar at one year of follow-up regardless of the energy used, long-term efficacy appeared higher after radiofrequency ablation.

The process is based on the application of a liquid film on the surface or object under sterilization (OUS). A beacon signal is used to self-steer the transmitted power from the designed retrodirective antenna array (RDA) towards the OUS using circularly polarized fields; then, the sterilization is completed by raising and maintaining the required temperature for a certain time. Results suggest that the process takes 5 minutes or less for an angular coverage range over 60 degrees whilst abiding by the relevant safety protocols. This paper also models the power incident onto the OUS, providing consistent results with full-wave simulations. A practical RDA system is developed using a 2  1 microstrip patch array operating at 2.5 GHz and tested through the positioning of a representative target surface. Measurements, developed by sampling the power transmitted by the heterodyne RDA, are reported for various distances and angles, operating in the near-field of the system. To further validate the methodology, an additional experiment investigating virus deactivation through microwave heating was also developed. Measurements have been performed with an open cavity microwave oven on the Coronavirus (strain 229E) and egg white protein in a cuvette. This demonstrates that the temperature increases of aqueous films up to 70 [Formula: see text] C by remote microwave-induced heat can denature proteins and deactivate viruses.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the dynamic changes of immunological and radiographic features, and the association with the outcome of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Peripheral blood samples and radiographic data were collected longitudinally for up to 8 weeks from 158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The chest computed tomography (CT) scans were scored based on a semi-quantification assessment according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities; the temporal change of the immunological and radiographic features was analyzed. Results: Compared with mild and moderate patients, severe patients had significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells but dramatically elevated counts of neutrophils and levels of interleukin (IL)-6. Sequential monitoring showed a sustained increase in lymphocytes counts and significantly decreased levels of IL-6 in severe patients during the disease course. Notably, patients with persistent pulmonary lesions (CT score &#8805; 5 in week 8) showed high levels of IL-6 during the follow-up period, compared with those with recovery lesions (CT score < 5 in week 8). More importantly, the peak expression of IL-6 prior to the aggravated lung injury was mainly found in patients with persistent lesions, and multivariate analysis showed that IL-6 level upon admission was an independent factor associated with the persistent pulmonary injury. Conclusion: Prolonged elevation of IL-6 is associated with persistent pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis using tract (N = 73,056) and county (N = 3142) level data from the US Census Bureau and other sources for the USA. Confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population was our outcome measure. We performed mixed-effect negative binomial regression to examine the association of county populations percentage residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts with COVID-19 deaths while controlling for several other characteristics. RESULTS: For every 10% increase in the percentage of county population residing in concentrated disadvantage and Black-concentrated tracts, the rate for confirmed COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population increases by a factor of 1.14 (mortality rate ratio [MMR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.11, 1.18) and 1.11 (MMR = 1.11; 95% CI:1.08, 1.14), respectively.

METHODS: We collected data from Gansu Province National Health Information Platform. A cross-sectional study was conducted, including patients with COVID-19 confirmed between January 23 and February 6, 2020, and analyzed the gender and age of the patients. We also described the incubation period, consultation time and sources of infection in the cases, and calculated the secondary cases that occurred within Gansu for each imported case. RESULTS: We found thirty-six (53.7%) of the patients were women and thirty-one (46.3%) men, and the median ages were 40 (IQR 31C53) years. Twenty-eight (41.8%) of the 67 cases had a history of direct exposure in Wuhan. Twenty-five (52.2%) cases came from ten families, and we found no clear reports of modes of transmission other than family clusters. The largest number of secondary cases linked to a single source was nine. CONCLUSION: More women than men were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Gansu Province.

There now exists many different approaches to apply residual insecticide to indoor and outdoor surfaces in malaria endemic settings. This review aims to synthesise the best available evidence regarding full or partial indoor or outdoor residual insecticide surface treatment for preventing malaria. Methods and Analysis: This review will comprehensively search the literature (both published and unpublished) for any studies investigating the effectiveness of residual insecticide surface treatment for malaria. Studies will be screened to meet the inclusion criteria by a minimum of two authors, followed by assessment of risk of bias (using appropriate risk of bias tools for randomised and non-randomised studies) and extraction of relevant information using structured forms by two independent authors. Meta-analysis will be carried out where possible for epidemiological outcomes such as malaria, anaemia, malaria related mortality, all-cause mortality and adverse effects. Certainty in the evidence will be established with GRADE assessments. Ethics and Dissemination: A full review report will be submitted to the Vector Control & Insecticide Resistance Unit, Global Malaria Program, WHO. A version of this report will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal. The report will inform the development of WHO recommendations regarding residual insecticide treatment for malaria.

Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed. The objective of this study was to explore the anxiety, perceived stress, and resilience in a population presenting at the general practitioner, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between February and April 2021 and 440 individuals who presented to the general practitioner were evaluated. Concerning anxiety level, almost half of the respondents (49,3%, N = 217) scored above the threshold value on the anxiety scale (mild intensity 38.6%, moderate intensity 9.9%, severe intensity 0.8%). Having a low level of resilience, as well as experiencing a high level of stress, are both predictive of the occurrence of high anxiety (p < 0.001, r = ?0.551 and p < 0.001, r = 0.622, respectively). Furthermore, resilience is negatively related to perceived stress (p < 0.001, r = ?0.676). It is critical in the current crisis to recognize those at risk of developing mental illnesses, taking into consideration the various socioeconomic classes, as well as to maintain and improve the general publics mental health using appropriate psychological interventions.","output":"Anxiety, Perceived Stress, and Resilience during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Population Estimates of Persons Presenting to a General Practitioner in Romania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred at universities during Fall 2020, but little is known about risk factors for campus-associated infections immunity provided by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in young adults.

Using campus weekly reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results, the relationship between survey responses, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infections was assessed. RESULTS: Of 6136 students, 1197 completed the survey and 572 also completed serologic testing in September compared with 517 and 414 in November, respectively. Participation in fraternity or sorority events (adjusted Risk Ratio (aRR): 19 [95% CI: 14C25]) and frequent alcohol consumption (aRR: 16 [12C22]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mask wearing during social events (aRR: 06 [06C10]) was associated with decreased risk. None of the 20 students with antibodies in September tested postive for SARS-CoV-2 during the semester, while 278% of students who tested RT-PCR positive tested negative for antibodies in November.

Previous experiments suggested that CCHFV enters the cells via a clathrin dependent pathway. Therefore, we have evaluated the potential anti-CCHFV activity of several molecules targeting this entry possibility. We identified two molecules chloroquine and chlorpromazine. Neutralization and virus yield reduction assays were tested in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells on two different CCHFV strains. Several combinations, including ribavirin, were assayed to test a potential synergistic effect. The two molecules inhibited CCHFV, and depending on the virus and the cell lines, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for chloroquine and chlorpromazine ranged from 28 to 43 and 10.8C15.7 M, respectively. Time-of-addition studies demonstrated that these molecules had a direct effect on CCHFV infectivity and spread. The antiviral activity of the two molecules was still effective even when added up to 6 h post-infection and up to 24 h. The selectivity index ranging from 3 to 35 lead us to evaluate combinations with ribavirin. Combinations of ribavirin and chloroquine or chlorpromazine were synergistic against CCHFV.

We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. RESULTS: We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5%, IQR 2.4-8.4%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6% perinatal) to high (59% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p<0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p<0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95% CI 2.64-4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.96-3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95% CI 1.01-32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.60-2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95% CI 1.28-3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9-38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames.

METHODS: This study used data from the Global COVID-19 Index provided by PEMANDU Associates. The sample, representing 161 countries, comprised the number of confirmed cases, deaths, stringency indices, population density and GNI per capita (USD). Correlation matrices were computed to reveal the association between the variables at three time points: day-30, day-60 and day-90. Three separate principal component analyses were computed for similar time points, and several standardized plots were produced. RESULTS: Confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 showed positive but weak correlation with stringency and GNI per capita. Through principal component analysis, the first two principal components captured close to 70% of the variance of the data. The first component can be viewed as the severity of the COVID-19 surge in countries, whereas the second component largely corresponded to population density, followed by GNI per capita of countries.

CONCLUSION: Visualization of the global spread of COVID-19 showed the unequal severity of the pandemic across continents and over time. Distinct patterns in clusters of countries, which separated many European countries from those in Africa, suggested a contrast in terms of stringency measures and wealth of a country.

Here we asked whether positive attitudes towards facial masks were higher in those who had been wearing them longer.

To confirm reliability of findings, the experiment was repeated in a subset of participants 8-10 weeks later. The findings show that regular use of protective masks was linked to their positive appraisal, with a higher frequency and a longer history of wearing a mask predicting increased mask attractiveness. These results extended to other COVID related objects relative to controls.

Infection of the human CNS with many different viruses or infection of the rodent CNS induces vigorous host-inflammatory responses with recruitment of large numbers of leukocytes, particularly T lymphocytes and macrophages. Chemokines coordinate trafficking of peripheral blood leukocytes by stimulating their chemotaxis, adhesion, extravasation, and other effector functions. In view of these properties, research efforts have turned increasingly to the possible involvement of chemokines in regulating both peripheral tissue and CNS leukocyte migration during viral infection. The biological effects of chemokines are mediated via their interaction with receptors belonging to the family of seven transmembrane (7TM)-spanning, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the normal mammalian CNS, the number of leukocytes present in the brain is scant. However, these cells are attracted to, and accumulate in, a variety of pathologic states, many involving viral infection. Although leukocyte migration into local tissue compartments, such as the CNS, is a multifactorial process, it has become clear that chemokines are pivotal components of this process, providing a necessary chemotactic signal for leukocyte recruitment.","output":"Chemokines and viral diseases of the central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When considering the provision of healthcare services, it is necessary to examine action at a local level and problems that local health service providers must face.

Significantly more patients in the preceding group suffered respiratory failure (28% vs. 61%, p = 0.024), and higher reoperation rate (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.042) and hospital mortality (0% vs. 22%, p = 0.013). In the current group, 31 (97%) patients experienced complete cure during hospitalization. Naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage and concomitant enteral nutritional support are less invasive, and effective and powerful methods to treat even major leakage after esophagectomy.

Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) strengthened both the natural immunity and acquired immunity and played an important role in organ transplantation. The roles of IL-18 in the occurrence, development, and drug treatment of OB remained unclear. METHODS: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mouse IL-18 (siRNA-IL-18) was used to silence IL-18 expression. Mouse heterotopic tracheal transplantation model was used to simulate OB. Recipient mice were divided into 5 groups (n = 12) according to donor mouse strains and drug treatment: isograft group, allograft group, allograft+tacrolimus group, allograft+azithromycin group, and allograft+tacrolimus+azithromycin group. The luminal obliteration rates were pathological evaluation. Expressions of cytokines and MMPs were detected by real-time PCR, western blot, and enzyme chain immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The luminal obliteration rates of IL-18 of the siRNA-IL-18 group were significantly lower than those of the negative control group (p < 0.0001) and the blank control group (p = 0.0002). mRNA expressions of IFN-, EMMPRIN, MMP-8, and MMP-9 of the siRNA-IL-18 group were significantly lower than those of the negative and blank control groups. No tracheal occlusion occurred in grafts of the isograft group. The rates of tracheal occlusion of the allograft group, allograft+tacrolimus group, allograft+azithromycin group, and allograft+tacrolimus+azithromycin group were 72.17  4.66%, 40.33  3.00%, 38.50  2.08%, and 23.33  3.24%, respectively.

There are currently no approved treatments providing high chance of recovery from a severe case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the beneficial effect of Remdesivir and passive immunization therapies may only be seen when administered early on disease onset. The emergence of variants is also raising concerns regarding the efficacy of antibody therapies, antivirals, and vaccines. Therefore, there is still a need to develop new antivirals. Here, we investigated the suitability of primary human epithelial cells from the trachea/bronchia (NHBE) and small airway (SAEC) as lung models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to determine, whether the microbicide polyphenylene carboxymethylene (PPCM) has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Both NHBE and SAEC expressed proteins required for virus entry in lung epithelial cells. However, these cells were only low to moderately permissive to SARS-CoV-2 as titers increased at best by 2.5 log(10) during an 8-day kinetic. Levels of replication in SAEC, unlike in NHBE, were consistent with data from other studies using human normal tissues or air-liquid interface cultures, suggesting that SAEC may be more relevant to use than NHBE for drug screening. PPCM EC(50) against SARS-CoV-2 was between 32 and 132 g/ml with a selectivity index between 12 and 41, depending on the cell type and the infective dose used. PPCM doses were consistent with those previously showing effect against other human viruses. Finally, PPCM antiviral effect observed in SAEC was in line with reduction of inflammatory markers observed overly expressed in severe COVID-19 patients. Altogether, our data support the fact that PPCM should be further evaluated in vivo for toxicity and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Polyphenylene carboxymethylene (PPCM) microbicide repurposed as antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.

The original TIBSIT has been validated for use in Taiwan with age specific scores for different age groups and diagnosis. The main aim of this study is to examine if TIBSIT can be applicable for the Malaysian population and perform cultural adaptation as necessary to allow a more accurate assessment using this tool. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A preliminary study of the original TIBSIT (Phase 1) followed by cultural adaption (Phase 2) were carried out on volunteers from various neighbourhoods in Klang Valley, Malaysia comprising of age group 16-80 years. A total of 150 test subjects and 50 test subjects were recruited for Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively. Cultural adaptation was done with changes to the distractors that were found to be confusing. In addition, modifications included added language translation and visual reinforcement with images of the odour's substance of origin. RESULTS: 109 out of the 150 responses were accepted for Phase 1. A detection rate of less than 75% was found in three of the odours with the remaining showing an average rate of 87.2% to 97.7%. These three odours were culturally adapted for Phase 2. All 50 responses for Phase 2 were accepted;two of the odours' detection rates improved to 98% but the plum odour was only detected 53% of the time. CONCLUSION: TIBSIT provides a quick office-based olfaction testing. The culturally adapted test kit is a potentially useful screening test for the Malaysian population.

Early isolation and containment is challenging. Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed. METHODS: Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a \\"respiratory surveillance ward\\" (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done. Patients could be transferred when SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative on 2 consecutive occasions, 24 hours apart. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1,178 patients were admitted to the RSWs. The mean length-of-stay (LOS) was 1.89 days (SD, 1.23). Among confirmed cases of pneumonia admitted to the RSW, 5 of 310 patients (1.61%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This finding was comparable to the pickup rate from our isolation ward. In total, 126 HCWs were potentially exposed to these cases; however, only 3 (2.38%) required quarantine because most used appropriate PPE. In addition, 13 inpatients overlapped with the index cases during their stay in the RSW; of these 13 exposed inpatients, 1 patient subsequently developed COVID-19 after exposure. No patient-HCW transmission was detected despite intensive surveillance.

Efficient utilization of blood bank facilities by frequent auditing is crucial; however, few studies have examined blood utilization in Saudi Arabia. We aimed to review the blood ordering patterns and transfusion practices, and blood bank audit effectiveness at a single center in Saudi Arabia and compare our results with those of a similar study performed in the same center 20 years ago. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective descriptive chart review of all healthy blood donors and recipients from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. We evaluated the crossmatching-to-transfusion ratio (C/T) as an indicator of blood bank utilization and compared the findings with those of the previous study. We also evaluated changes in blood bank utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. RESULTS: Findings from 27,414 donors (men, 94.9%; mean age, 32.2 + 9.6 years) showed a 71% increase in blood donations compared to that of 2000. The donations gradually increased over the years, peaking just before COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020. For 3,836 patients, 13,324 units of blood were crossmatched (average, 3.47 crossmatch/patient), with 23% of the crossmatch requests from surgical departments. The average C/T ratio, transfusion index, and transfusion probability (T%) were 1.37, 2.55, and 73.2%, respectively. The C/T ratio decreased by 54% between 2000 and 2020. During the pandemic, crossmatching decreased by 26% between 2019 and 2020, but with comparable C/T ratio in 2019 (1.45) and 2020 (1.39). CONCLUSION: Our hospital blood bank utilization improved over the past 20 years, showing increased donations, reduced C/T ratio, and increased T%.

In this paper we explore how a planned intervention may be negatively perceivedeven as a form of structural violenceand may prevent Narcan (naloxone) use to stop an overdose related death in the Skid Row of Los Angeles. Data for this study consisted of a combination of Spatial Video Geonarratives (SVGs) and 325 incident reports from the Homeless Health Care Los Angeles Center for Harm Reduction (HHCLA-HRC) between November 2014 and December 2015. Chi-square and simple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between fear-of-arrest and other covariates of interest.

We screened 1930 FDA-approved ligands for the selection of optimal ones blocking this interaction. Virtual screening predicted top 25 ligands docking to any of the reported binding sites. After exclusion of those ligands which were unsuitable for systemic use, the remaining 69 RBD-ligand complexes were screened based on the masking capacity of the amino acid residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction, excluding 47 RBD-ligand complexes. A short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis identified 11 globally stable complexes with the lowest RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). Next, a moderately long MD analysis revealed those six RBD-ligand complexes with the lowest RMSD variation, as a measure of global stability. Finally, a long MD analysis revealed two select candidate ligands, including ritonavir and naloxegol, highly stabilizing those key residues engaged in RBD-hACE2 interaction. A similar MD analysis of a few antiviral drugs which are under clinical trials or approved for COVID-19 treatment showed them inferior to both select ligands in terms of stabilizing the RBD globally and locally at binding sites.

The World Health Organization recommends 150 min of moderate exercise per week for older adults to achieve these health benefits. However, only 20-60 % of adults aged 60 years and above currently meet these recommendations for exercise. The widespread use of the internet and mobile phones among older adults may open new opportunities to promote PA in this population. Findings of previous reviews suggest that eHealth interventions are effective in promoting PA in adults of various ages. However, to date, none of these reviews have provided a differentiated picture of engagement in such interventions and effects on PA among older adults. Also, we are unaware of any studies comparing effects of participation in eHealth vs. traditional paper-and-pencil interventions on PA in this population. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the effectiveness of eHealth interventions promoting PA in older adults aged 55 years and above with either a non-eHealth PA intervention or a group that is not exposed to any intervention. METHODS Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PEI, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and OpenGrey) will be searched to identify experimental and quasi-experimental studies examining the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for PA promotion in adults aged 55 years and above. Two authors will independently select and review references, extract data, and assess the quality of the included studies by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool.

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute of North India, from June 2012 through March 2014, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h. All enrolled children were assessed daily for development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) using the case definition given by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chest radiograph and microbiologic samplings were performed in children suspected to have VAP. Risk factors associated with VAP were calculated by doing bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were screened and 86 were enrolled (median age 30 mo 95% CI 4.0C84.0; 72% boys). The most common admitting diagnosis was sepsis (16%) followed by acyanotic congenital heart disease with pneumonia (14%) and the most common indication for ventilation was respiratory failure (45.3%). The incidence of VAP according to CDC criteria was 38.4%, while the incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 24.4%. The incidence of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was found to be 11.6%. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated organism (47%) followed by Pseudomonas (28%), Klebsiella (15%), E. coli (5%) and Enterobacter (5%). Risk factors for VAP on bivariate analysis were use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (p = 0.027, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1C24.3), enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1C19.4) and re-intubation (p = 0.024, OR 3.3 and 95% CI 1.1C9.6). On multivariate analysis, use of PPI (p = 0.03, OR 8.47, 95% CI 1.19C60.33) and enteral feeding (p < 0.001, OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.58C57.78) were identified as independent risk factors for VAP.

It is unclear which mutations affect receptor affinity versus immune recognition. METHODS: We produced wild type RBD, RBD with single mutations (E484K, K417N, or N501Y) or with all three mutations combined and tested their binding to ACE2 by biolayer interferometry (BLI). The ability of convalescent sera to recognize RBDs and block their interaction with ACE2 was tested as well. RESULTS: We demonstrated that single mutation N501Y increased binding affinity to ACE2 but did not strongly affect its recognition by convalescent sera. In contrast, single mutation E484K had almost no impact on the binding kinetics, but essentially abolished recognition of RBD by convalescent sera. Interestingly, combining mutations E484K, K417N, and N501Y resulted in a RBD with both features: enhanced receptor binding and abolished immune recognition.

This paper presents how the user-centred design process together with a patient organisation was transformed to a digital approach and the experiences from performing a remote co-creation user workshop. The digital approximation had a satisfactory result and the main contribution lies in the sharing of recommendations for how to practically apply a remote user-centred design methodology.","output":"User-Centred Design with a Remote Approach: Experiences from the Chronic Pain Project."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like all viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 acts at multiple levels, hijacking fundamental cellular functions and assuring its replication and immune system evasion.

We report the free energy profile for both K+ and Cl- transfer from the cytosol to the extracellular domain. The important role of ORF3a in the viral cycle and its high conservation among coronaviruses may also make it a target of choice for future antiviral development, further justifying the elucidation of its mechanism at the atomistic level.","output":"Hijacking of Cellular Functions by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2.

Medical students should critically appraise the research evidence to help them during their clinical practice in the future. We conducted this study to assess the skills, terms and attitude toward EBM. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for medical students from governmental universities. Students completed an online validated questionnaire consisting of several sections to assess skills, attitude and knowledge about terms related to EBM. We used a scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree) for the 11 questions assessing the attitude and a scale ranging from 1(Poor) to 5(advanced) for EBM skills. RESULTS: A total of 761 medical students with a mean age of 21.97  1.64 participated in the study. 327 (43 %) of them were males. The most commonly used search engines were Google 690 (91 %) and Wikipedia 465 (61 %). Medical books 719 (94 %) and lecture notes 353 (46 %) were the most common sources for health information. The majority of students rated their skills related to EBM as average and below average for all questions (overall = 2.18  0.8). Students rated their skills as poor (31 %) in locating professional literature, as average (34 %) in searching online databases, poor (42 %) in critical appraisal of a scientific publication reporting findings from clinical research and poor (36 %) in Critical appraisal of available scientific literature. Regarding attitude, the overall mean score was 2.83  0.76. There is no significant difference in attitude score between students with or without EBM training (P = 0.2). The terms with the highest understanding were case-control study (45 %) and case report (44 %) for study design. Median (44 %) and sample size (43 %) for statistics. Incidence (46 %) and prevalence (44 %) for epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students have a knowledge gap in skills and terms related to EBM and an average attitude towards EBM. The majority of them were using a nonscientific search engine to obtain medical information. There is a need to educate students about the proper steps for getting the scientific literature and EBM skills.

Policy decisions, however, are rarely informed by comprehensive economic evaluations (EE) including vaccination's wide-ranging value. The objective of this analysis was to focus on health technology assessment systems to identify relevant value concepts in order to improve current EE of non-pandemic vaccines. METHODS Following a literature review, a novel Value of Vaccination (VoV) framework was developed with experts in vaccine EE from developed countries with established health technology assessment systems. RESULTS Forty-four studies presenting value frameworks or concepts applicable to vaccination were included. Eighteen unique value concepts relevant to EE were identified and defined. These were categorised within the VoV framework using three dimensions, moving from a narrow payer perspective to a more expansive and societal perspective. The dimensions were: (I) conventional payer perspective concepts (e.g., health gains in vaccinees, direct medical costs); (II) conventional societal perspective concepts (e.g., indirect health/economic gains to caregivers/households, productivity in vaccinees); and (III) novel societal concepts (e.g., financial risk protection, peace of mind, societal health gains, healthcare systems security, political stability, social equity and macroeconomic gains). While good quality evidence and methods are available to support concepts in Dimensions I and II, further work is needed to generate the required evidence for vaccination impact on Dimension III concepts. CONCLUSIONS The devastating effect on nations of the COVID-19 pandemic has helped to highlight the potential far-reaching benefits that many vaccination programmes can offer. This VoV framework is particularly relevant to policy decisions considering EE, and the potential future expansion of non-pandemic vaccination value considerations. The framework helps to understand and compare current value considerations across countries and payer versus societal perspectives. It provides decision-makers with a transparent and logical path to broaden consideration of VoV in EE.","output":"Capturing the value of vaccination within health technology assessment and health economics: Literature review and novel conceptual framework."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: CoV infections can potentially cause from a simple cold to a severe respiratory syndrome, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).

The most efficacious palliative care interventions, the optimal model of their delivery and the most appropriate outcome measures in ICU are not clear. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of randomised clinical trials and observational studies to evaluate the number and types of palliative care interventions implemented within the ICU setting, to assess their impact on ICU practice and to evaluate differences in palliative care approaches across different countries. RESULTS Fifty-eight full articles were identified, including 9 randomised trials and 49 cohort studies; all but 4 were conducted within North America. Interventions were categorised into five themes: communication (14, 24.6%), ethics consultations (5, 8.8%), educational (18, 31.6%), involvement of a palliative care team (28, 49.1%) and advance care planning or goals-of-care discussions (7, 12.3%). Thirty studies (51.7%) proposed an integrative model, whilst 28 (48.3%) reported a consultative one. The most frequently reported outcomes were ICU or hospital length of stay (33/55, 60%), limitation of life-sustaining treatment decisions (22/55, 40%) and mortality (15/55, 27.2%). Quantitative assessment of pooled data was not performed due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes between studies. CONCLUSION Beneficial effects on the most common outcomes were associated with strategies to enhance palliative care involvement, either with an integrative or a consultative approach.

The age structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to COVID-related deaths in general. The coresidence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of COVID-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational coresidence, are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of COVID-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus. Preventing primary infections among the elderly is the most effective in countries with small households and little intergenerational coresidence, such as France, whereas confining younger age groups can have a greater impact in countries with large and intergenerational households, such as Bangladesh.","output":"National age and coresidence patterns shape COVID-19 vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores diverse views on both the current challenges and limits as well as the reforms and innovations of existing democracies at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Since its outbreak in December 2019, Wuhan, China, extensive collection of diverse data from cell culture and animal infections as well as population level data from an ongoing pandemic, has been vital in assessing strategies to battle its spread. Mathematical modelling plays a key role in quantifying determinants that drive virus infection dynamics, especially those relevant for epidemiological investigations and predictions as well as for proposing efficient mitigation strategies. We utilized a simple mathematical model to describe and explain experimental results on viral replication cycle kinetics during SARS-CoV-2 infection of animal and human derived cell lines, green monkey kidney cells, Vero-E6, and human lung epithelium cells, A549-ACE2, respectively. We conducted cell infections using two distinct initial viral concentrations and quantified viral loads over time. We then fitted the model to our experimental data and quantified the viral parameters. We showed that such cellular tropism generates significant differences in the infection rates and incubation times of SARS-CoV-2, that is, the times to the first release of newly synthesised viral progeny by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Specifically, the rate at which A549-ACE2 cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 15 times lower than that in the case of Vero-E6 cell infection and the duration of latent phase of A549-ACE2 cells was 1.6 times longer than that of Vero-E6 cells. On the other hand, we found no statistically significant differences in other viral parameters, such as viral production rate or infected cell death rate. Since in vitro infection assays represent the first stage in the development of antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, discrepancies in the viral parameter values across different cell hosts have to be identified and quantified to better target vaccine and antiviral research.","output":"Mathematical modelling of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human and animal host cells reveals differences in the infection rates and delays in viral particle production by infected cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To review the literature on retention strategies in follow-up studies and their relevance to critical care and to comment on the Toronto experience with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) follow-up studies.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is formed by the reaction between NO and oxygen, and when combined with water in the airways, NO2, forms nitric acid, leading to a caustic burn of the airways. In this study, we designed and developed a breathing system capable of safely delivering high concentrations of NO. Methods We developed a gas delivery system that utilizes standard respiratory circuit connectors, a reservoir bag, and a scavenging chamber containing calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) (Fig. 1). The system was tested using a bench testing lung and a mechanical ventilator. The NO concentration was measured by a NO analyzer connected to the inspiratory limb via a sampling line. NO2 levels were simultaneously evaluated by the Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift (CAPS) NO2 monitor using the same sampling port. To assess the efficacy of the Ca(OH)2 scavenger in reducing the inspiratory levels of NO2, we used a range of target NO concentrations (50, 150, and 250 ppm), two different levels of FiO2 (0.21 and 0.40) and measured NO2 levels with and without the scavenger. We administered high-dose NO with our system to healthy adult volunteers as part of a trial conducted at MGH. Each administration lasted for 15 minutes. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and methemoglobin (MetHb) were continuously monitored with a pulse co-oximeter. Results Using our delivery system, we were able to reach NO concentration up 250 ppm with an Inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 0.21 and 0.4. The scavenger reduced the inhaled NO2 concentration to an average of 0.9 ppm (CI -1.58, -0.22;p=0.01). At 150 ppm of inhaled NO, the NO2 concentration was maintained below 1.2 ppm with FiO2 from 0.21 to 0.40. Our data suggest that the scavenger can efficiently reduce NO2 in the circuit for NO delivery. We administered NO to 4 adult volunteers. The total number of NO administrations was 30. The average concentration of inspired NO was 163.910.1 ppm with NO2 levels of 0.750.08 ppm. During the administration methemoglobin levels increased from a baseline value of 0.970.6% to 2.170.43%. The subjects did not experience any adverse events.

Ten physicians and nurses were recruited from the pediatric and adult EDs at a high-volume hospital in New York City, USA to complete in-depth interviews to provide their perspectives on barriers to routine HIV testing of youth ages 13 to 24 in EDs. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide with questions and probes. All interviews were conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded independently by two researchers using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Participants often offered HIV testing to youth in the ED based on their perceptions of patients' HIV risk, with pediatric providers sometimes discouraging adolescents they perceived to be at low HIV risk from testing. Participants cited other priorities, logistics of blood-based testing, and discomfort discussing HIV as other reasons for not offering HIV testing to all youth in the ED. Efforts are needed to encourage providers to offer HIV testing to all youth regardless of perceived risk, as the ED often serves as youths' only point of contact with the healthcare system.

The aim of this study was to describe the ventilation and physiologic factors at the time of VV ECMO decannulation and to determine if these factors have association with mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay after ECMO decannulation. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective cohort study. SETTING: Eleven ICUs in Australia. PATIENTS: Adult patients treated with VV ECMO from March 19, 2019, to September 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Liberation from VV ECMO. RESULTS: Of 87 patients receiving VV ECMO, the median age was 49 years (interquartile range, 37C59 yr), 61 of 87 (70%) were male, and 52/87 (60%) had a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. There were 24 of 87 patients (28%) who died prior to day 90. No patient required a second run of VV ECMO. In a multivariate models, a higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (p < 0.01) and respiratory rate at the time of decannulation (p = 0.01) were predictive of a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay postdecannulation in survivors. Higher positive end-expiratory pressure at ECMO decannulation was associated with shorter duration of ICU length of stay post-ECMO decannulation in survivors (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and higher respiratory rate at ECMO decannulation were associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased duration of ICU stay postdecannulation, and increased positive end-expiratory pressure at decannulation was associated with decreased duration of ICU stay postdecannulation.

These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

Current sepsis guidelines recommend resuscitation with intravascular fluid administration in association with inotropes and vasopressors to maintain organ perfusion [2]. Dobutamine is recommended as first-line inotropic agent and should be administered when low cardiac output or signs of hypoperfusion persist after adequate fluid resuscitation and perfusion pressure have been achieved [2]. However, the efficacy of dobutamine in patients with heart failure has not been fully demonstrated and concerns on its use are still present [3]. Although dobutamine improves perfusion and increases oxygen delivery (DO(2)), its impact on survival in septic shock patients is limited, with guideline recommendations based mainly on the landmark study by Rivers et al. [4]. Recently, Wilkman et al. [5] reported that the use of inotropes, particularly dobutamine, in septic shock was associated with increased 90-day mortality. In explaining the lack of outcome benefit [3, 5], several aspects need to be taken into account. First, the need of inotropic support may simply represent an expression of disease severity rather than the cause of a poor outcome. Second, whereas the treatment of impaired cardiac output should be tailored based on the etiological mechanism of the cardiovascular dysfunction, the current guidelines recommend the use of inotropes without differentiating the underlying causes of impaired left ventricular (LV) stroke volume [2, 6]. In addition, the majority of cardiovascular monitoring instruments provide data almost exclusively on cardiac output and pressures. This approach may potentially increase the number of patients who may be harmed by inotrope administration (Fig. 1). Finally, the beneficial short-term effect of enhanced contractility by cAMP-increasing drugs (e. g., dobutamine, milrinone) is, at least partly, abolished by the increased energy consumption, the worsening of ventricular relaxation and the direct cardiomyocyte toxicity [1, 7C10].","output":"Inotropic Support in the Treatment of Septic Myocardial Dysfunction: Pathophysiological Implications Supporting the Use of Levosimendan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2021 many people in the Netherlands will be vaccinated against COVID-19.

METHODS: A UK-wide online and telephone survey was conducted with older adults, people with dementia, and carers between April and May 2020. The survey captured demographic and postcode data, social support service usage before and after COVID-19 public health measures, current quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between social support service variations and anxiety and well-being. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-nine participants completed the survey (61 people with dementia, 285 unpaid carers, and 223 older adults). Paired samples t-tests and X2 -tests showed that the mean hour of weekly social support service usage and the number of people having accessed various services was significantly reduced post COVID-19. Multiple regression analyses showed that higher variations in social support service hours significantly predicted increased levels of anxiety in people with dementia and older adults, and lower levels of mental well-being in unpaid carers and older adults.

To better understand what constitutes cannabis-induced behavioral effects, our objective was to identify a novel panel of blood-based metabolites that are predictive, diagnostic, and/or prognostic of behavioral effects. At 8 weeks of age, male rats were randomly assigned to groups and were gavage fed with full-spectrum cannabis extract (tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) along with all other cannabis compounds, 15 mg/kg), broad-spectrum cannabis extract (CBD along with all other cannabis compounds, 15 mg/kg), or vehicle oil. Four hours after being gavage fed, behavioral assessments were determined using the open field test and the elevated plus maze. Following these assessments, serum was collected from all rats and the serum metabolites were identified and quantified by LCCMS/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. We found that only rats treated with full-spectrum cannabis extract exhibited behavioral changes.

However, the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation cannot be easily evaluated in the clinical setting of HD therapy. We included 185 HD patients and 15 healthy volunteers as the control group in this study. Before HD, hepatic regional oxygen saturation (rSO2), a marker of hepatic oxygenation reflecting the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation, was monitored using an INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Hepatic rSO2 was significantly lower in patients undergoing HD than in healthy controls (56.4  14.9% vs. 76.2  9.6%, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed that hepatic rSO2 was independently associated with body mass index (BMI; standardized coefficient: 0.294), hemoglobin (Hb) level (standardized coefficient: 0.294), a history of cardiovascular disease (standardized coefficient: -0.157), mean blood pressure (BP; standardized coefficient: 0.154), and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.150) in Model 1 via a simple linear regression analysis. In Model 2 using the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in place of serum albumin concentration, the COP (standardized coefficient: 0.134) was also identified as affecting hepatic rSO2. Basal hepatic oxygenation before HD might be affected by BMI, Hb levels, a history of cardiovascular disease, mean BP, serum albumin concentration, and the COP. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify whether changes in these parameters, including during HD, affect the hepato-splanchnic circulation and oxygenation in HD patients.","output":"Association between hepatic oxygenation on near-infrared spectroscopy and clinical factors in patients undergoing hemodialysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has caused great distress in the lives of many populations.

In our institution, CTCA availability was increased in January 2020, and subsequently, expanded further to replace all exercise testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective was to assess the impact of increased utilisation of CTCA on length of stay in patients presenting with chest pain in the prepandemic era and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Study design was retrospective. Patients referred for cardiology review between October 2019 and May 2020 with chest pain and/or dyspnoea were broken into three cohorts: a baseline cohort, a cohort with increased CTCA availability and a cohort with increased CTCA availability, but after the national lockdown due to COVID-19. Coronary angiography and revascularisation, length of stay and 30-day adverse outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 513 patients (35.3% female) presented over cohorts 1 (n=179), 2 (n=182), and 3 (n=153). CTCA use increased from 7.8% overall in cohort 1% to 20.4% in cohort 3. Overall length of stay for the patients undergoing CTCA decreased from a median of 4.2 days in cohort 1 to 2.5 days in cohort 3, with no increase in 30 days adverse outcomes.

Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment to make recommendations for dosing. METHODS: COVID-19 agents included in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool COVID-19 drug interaction website ( www.covid19-druginteractions.org ), initially identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic databases. FINDINGS: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin, tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities. CONCLUSION: Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is complex. These recommendations were produced to provide guidance to clinicians worldwide who are treating patients with COVID-19, many of whom will have some degree of acute or chronic renal or hepatic impairment.","output":"Recommendations for Dosing of Repurposed COVID-19 Medications in Patients with Renal and Hepatic Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental noise control is necessary for human health and auditory comfort conditions.

This study evaluates safety risk in terms of nature and severity of probable conflicts during overtaking maneuvers on a bi-directional undivided two-lane highway in a heterogeneous traffic environment of a low-income country. Nature and severity of probable conflicts were defined with the application of surrogate safety proximity indicators in real-world naturalistic driving environment. METHOD A risk severity model for overtaking maneuver was developed to better understand the significant factors associated with the probability of conflict and its severity during overtaking maneuver using discrete choice modeling approaches. The relevance of three alternate discrete outcome frameworks, namely multinomial logit (ML), ordered probit (OP), and mixed logit (MXL) models are addressed. The best fitted model is identified and estimated. The impact of the significant attributes was also evaluated.

To explore health professionals' (working in wound care, treating both acute and hard-to-heal wounds) position in terms of the following: awareness of AMS; if they are aware of AMS, if they implement procedures to support its practice; and if they implement AMS, do they measure its impact by and compare pre- and post-implementation? METHOD: An e-survey designed to explore health professionals' awareness of AMS and its implications for wound care. RESULTS: There were 987 respondents to the survey. The majority were specialist wound care nurses, mainly based in the UK or the US and Canada. A high proportion of those surveyed were completely/partially aware (35.1/57.9%, respectively) of AMS, and almost all implemented strategies to reduce antimicrobial prescribing. Of those surveyed, 36% took steps to measure the impact of AMS, and as a result 35.2% reported positive impacts (for example, cost reductions, a reduction in the systemic use of antimicrobials, a reduction in the topical use of antimicrobials and a reduced level of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms). Challenging aspects of AMS implementation were reported by 33.2% of respondents (for example, poorer clinical outcomes in terms of healing and increased costs). The data highlighted that 40.49% felt that AMS would be 'easy' or 'very easy' to implement while 21.73% felt that AMS would be 'difficult' or 'very difficult' to implement. CONCLUSION: Education strategies need to be devised to raise awareness and support health professionals, including wound care practitioners, to understand and implement effective AMS programmes.

Once in prison, there is systemic discrimination against imprisoned LGBTQ+ people and a lack of understanding and concern regarding their care, treatment and support needs. While there is growing interest in their protection and that of other vulnerable populations in prison settings, little is known about their views and experiences regarding their distinct psychosocial needs. The aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and synthesize the existing research evidence relating to the unique psychological and social experiences of LGBTQ+ people in prison and identify aspects that may help or hinder access to appropriate psychosocial interventions and supports. The PRISMA procedure was utilized. A search of relevant databases from January 2010 to March 2021 was undertaken. Studies were identified that involved LGBTQ+ people, and addressed their views and experiences regarding their psychosocial needs whilst in prison. The search yielded 858 papers in total. Following the application of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria a total of 12 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Quality was assessed using the CASP instrument. Following analysis, three themes were identified: (i) interpersonal factors (ii) intrapersonal factors and (iii) institutional factors. The policy, education and practice development implications are highlighted and discussed. Future research opportunities have been identified that will add significantly to the body of evidence that may further the development of appropriate health interventions and supports specific to the LGBTQ+ population in prison.","output":"Views and Experiences of LGBTQ+ People in Prison Regarding Their Psychosocial Needs: A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Research Evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted recombination within the S (spike) gene of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was promoted by passage of helper respiratory virus isolates in cells transfected with a TGEV-derived defective minigenome carrying the S gene from an enteric isolate. The minigenome was efficiently replicated in trans and packaged by the helper virus, leading to the formation of true recombinant and pseudorecombinant viruses containing the S proteins of both enteric and respiratory TGEV strains in their envelopes. The recombinants acquired an enteric tropism, and their analysis showed that they were generated by homologous recombination that implied a double crossover in the S gene resulting in replacement of most of the respiratory, attenuated strain S gene (nucleotides 96 to 3700) by the S gene of the enteric, virulent isolate. The recombinant virus was virulent and rapidly evolved in swine testis cells by the introduction of point mutations and in-phase codon deletions in a domain of the S gene (nucleotides 217 to 665) previously implicated in the tropism of TGEV. The helper virus, with an original respiratory tropism, was also found in the enteric tract, probably because pseudorecombinant viruses carrying the spike proteins from the respiratory strain and the enteric virus in their envelopes were formed. These results demonstrated that a change in the tropism and virulence of TGEV can be engineered by sequence changes in the S gene.","output":"Targeted recombination demonstrates that the spike gene of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus is a determinant of its enteric tropism and virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major interventions have been introduced worldwide to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large scale lockdown of human movements are effective in reducing the spread, but they come at a cost of significantly limited societal functions. We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","output":"Heterogeneous interventions reduce the spread of COVID-19 in simulations on real mobility data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The devastating context of the Covid-19 pandemic has created a new reality in which tourism has practically come to a standstill, a situation that must be reversed This study focuses on the revitalization of businesses run by lifestyle entrepreneurs, a very significant class, of pivotal importance in innovation in the tourism sector Specifically, this study aims to identify the most relevant indicators to select the recovery strategies of these entrepreneurs Using the Delphi method combined with the Q-sort technique, a ranking of the indicators was produced on the basis of input from a panel of 26 senior managers and academics The top five indicators were: creativity and innovation, level of innovation, qualification, startups number, and turnover volume Findings reveal that the priority is on innovation and the qualification of the entrepreneurs Only afterward do the traditional indicators of competitiveness of tourist destinations emerge","output":"Selecting lifestyle entrepreneurship recovery strategies: A response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global emergence of novel coronavirus disease and its rapid global expansion over a short span of time require effective countermeasures to combat it. Development of a specific vaccine can induce an optimal antibody response, thus providing immunity against it. Our study proposes a detailed and comprehensive immunoinformatic approach that can be applied to the currently available coronavirus protein data in the online server for vaccine candidate development. We have identified the receptor binding domain (RBD) of structural spike protein (S1) as a potential target for immunity against COVID- 19 infection. Epitope prediction illustrated cytotoxic T-cell epitopes, helper T-cell epitopes, and B-cell epitopes associated with the target protein. These were joined through specific linkers along with adjuvant beta-defensin located at the N-terminal to create a multi epitope subunit vaccine (MESV). The specificity in the binding of the devised vaccine candidate to the TLR-3 immune cell receptor was evaluated via molecular docking interaction studies. Good docking score combined with robust interactions in the binding cavity certified the stringency of the engineered vaccine. Molecular dynamics simulation data showed minimal variation of the root-mean square deviations (RMSDs) and root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) which confirmed the interaction stability. These results obtained from various in-silico experiments indicate the potency of this vaccine candidate as a probable therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Vaccination strategies targeting conserved epitope-based immune response would be beneficial in providing cross protection across beta-coronaviruses, and such vaccines would be resistant to the ever-evolving viruses.

This cessation of activities may have impacted weight gain in children and adolescents. The aims of our study were to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the BMI of children and adolescents in treatment for obesity, and to compare its evolution to that of the previous year at the same time, as well as to that of normal-weight children. Methods This retrospective study gathered demographic and anthropometric data from subjects aged 2C18 years both with normal weight and with obesity, who attended our hospital clinics at four time points: before and after the lockdown period in 2020, and at the same times of the year in 2019. We used paired t-tests to assess weight, BMI and BMI z-score changes, linear and standard multiple regressions, independent Students t-tests or Chi-square tests to compare groups, and Pearson correlation coefficient when appropriate. Results Forty-seven children with obesity and 20 normal-weight subjects had complete data for the 4 visits. The mean BMI increased in both groups during the lockdown (obese: +0.96  1.5 vs. control: +0.51  0.5), however the increase was significantly more important in the subjects with obesity compared to the same period in 2019 (2019: +0.33  1.0;mean difference between 2019 and 2020: +0.63  2.0 p = 0.034). Conclusion The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on the BMI of youth with obesity. Interestingly we observed extreme changes in this population, which was not the case in normal-weight children. Therefore, families with a child with obesity must be actively supported during these stressful and obesogenic periods of confinement.","output":"Evaluation of the Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on BMI in Children and Adolescents with or Without Obesity (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the rapid depletion of water resources, more interest is paid for the efficient desalination process in recent years. MoS2 membrane aroused attention due to its high mechanical stability and electronic properties, which can sustain extra-large strains. In this study, the electronic properties and water desalination performance of TiO2/MoS2-hexagonal, and TiO2/MoS2-rhombohedral nanocomposites bilayer membranes were studied and simulated for the first time. The effect of TiO2 in the performance of MoS2 was observed in water desalination under the defined applied pressure ranging from 50 to 250 MPa with a 6.4 ? pore diameter. The membrane structure is created and optimized. The energy minimized for TiO2 from - 19,596.4282 kcal/mol for the initial structure to - 19,605.1611 kcal/mol for the final structure. For TiO2/MoS2-hexagonal, the energy minimized from - 4955.54271 eV) to - 4955.62091 eV and TiO2/MoS2-rhombohedral from - 6042.26925 eV to - 6046.91835 eV. A molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed using Material Studio 2019 to study the electronic properties under 0-1 eV electric field using the CASTEP code. The results showed a better photocatalytic performance under the external electric field. The effect of external electric field significantly intensifies absorption in the visible range and achieved a high photocatalytic activity on TiO2/MoS2.

Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16C24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to pre-corona, but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering post-corona consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field.","output":"Changing Patterns of Substance Use During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Self-Reported Use of Tobacco, Alcohol, Cannabis, and Other Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been linked to the Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS).

The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R t ) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.

Bacterial infections are very common in NHL patients. Because most of the patients do not experience apparent symptoms during the initial stage of infection, it is difficult to detect the underlying condition before it progresses to a more critical level. The activation of the cytokines is a hallmark of inflammation. Due to the advantages of short detection time and high sensitivity of cytokines, many studies have focused on relationship between cytokines and infection. However, few studies have been conducted on NHL patients with infection. Therefore, we reviewed the cytokine profiles of 229 newly diagnosed NHL patients and 40 healthy adults to predict respiratory bacterial infection and bacteremia. Our findings revealed that IL-6(41.67 vs 9.50 pg/mL), IL-8(15.55 vs 6.61 pg/mL), IL-10(8.02 vs 4.52 pg/mL),TNF-(3.82 vs 2.96 pg/mL), IFN- (4.76 vs 2.96 pg/mL), body temperature(37.6 vs 36.5C), CRP(20.80 vs 4.37 mg/L), and PCT(0.10 vs 0.04 ng/mL) levels were considerably greater in NHL cases with respiratory bacterial infections relative to NHL cases without infection (P<0.05). Furthermore, IL-6(145.00 vs 41.67 pg/mL), IL-8(34.60 vs 15.55 pg/mL),temperature(38.4 vs 37.6C), PCT(0.79 vs 0.10 ng/mL), and CRP(93.70 vs 20.80 mg/L) levels in respiratory infectious NHL patients with more severe bacteremia were considerably elevated than in patients with respiratory bacterial infections only (P<0.05). Remarkably, increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 are effective in determining whether or not pulmonary bacterial infectious NHL patients have bacteremia. Temperature, PCT, and CRP all have lower sensitivity and specificity than IL-6. IL-6 18.79pg/mL indicates the presence of pulmonary bacterial infection in newly diagnosed NHL patients, and IL-6 102.6pg/mL may suggest pulmonary bacterial infection with bacteremia. In short, this study shows that cytokines can be advantageous in the diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary bacterial infection and bacteremia in newly diagnosed NHL patients and may also guide for the use of clinical antibiotics.","output":"Increased Cytokine Levels Assist in the Diagnosis of Respiratory Bacterial Infections or Concurrent Bacteremia in Patients With Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the paper by Putman et al.(1).

The most active compound, 2-acetyl-8-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (15), which exhibited much higher potency in enzyme inhibitions than shikonin as the positive control, displayed an IC(50) value of 72.07  4.84 nM towards M(pro)-mediated hydrolysis of the fluorescently labeled peptide. It fit well into the active site cavity of the enzyme by forming hydrogen bonds with adjacent amino acid residues in molecular docking studies. The results from in vitro antiviral activity evaluation demonstrated that the most potent M(pro) inhibitor could significantly suppress the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells within the low micromolar concentrations, with its EC(50) value of about 4.55 M. It was non-toxic towards the host Vero E6 cells under tested concentrations. The present research work implied that juglone skeleton could be a primary template for the development of potent M(pro) inhibitors.","output":"Discovery of juglone and its derivatives as potent SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bexarotene is a very rare cause of central hypothyroidism (CH) and its effects have been reported to be dose-dependent; however, the available data in the literature on dose-dependent effects are variable. The standard practice of monitoring thyroid function using thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to adjust levothyroxine (LT4) dose does not apply to bexarotene since it causes CH. In CH, TSH is not reliable. Hence free tetraiodothyronine (fT(4)) level is used to monitor and adjust the LT4 dose. We report a case of an 81-year-old Caucasian male with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who was treated with bexarotene. His pre-treatment TSH was normal at 1.6 IU/mL (reference range: 0.46-4.68 IU/mL). Post-bexarotene, the total tetraiodothyronine (T(4)) level was within the reference range, but a downward trend was noted. Eventually, total triiodothyronine (T(3)) dropped to a low level of 0.61 ng/mL (reference range: 0.97-1.69 ng/mL), and LT4 was initiated. Bexarotene dose was increased, but LT4 was not increased by the primary physician who relied on TSH level, which was low, and hence the existing LT4 dose was maintained. The patient had persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism and, eventually, a diagnosis of CH was made. The symptoms of hypothyroidism improved after normalizing fT(4), with an increase in the LT4 dose. This case represents an example of missed CH due to bexarotene, -which led to suboptimal LT4 replacement impacting the quality of life for the patient.","output":"Bexarotene: A Rare Cause of Misleading Thyroid Function Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infections require early diagnosis and adequate treatment. With the antibiotic overuse and increment in antibiotic resistance there is an increased need to accurately distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.

Biomarkers were analyzed in patients with viral respiratory infections and patients with bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis (n = 135). Results were compared with values obtained from 144 healthy controls. All biomarkers were elevated in bacterial and viral infections compared to healthy controls. Calprotectin was significantly increased in patients with bacterial infections; bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis compared with viral infections. PCT was significantly elevated in patients with bacterial pneumonia compared to viral infections but not in streptococcal tonsillitis or mycoplasma caused infections. HBP was not able to distinguish between bacterial and viral causes of infections. The overall clinical performance of calprotectin in the distinction between bacterial and viral respiratory infections, including mycoplasma was greater than performance of PCT and HBP.

METHODS PS was evaluated in 4 neonatal and 6 adult ventilators using a bench model to evaluate triggering, pressurization, and cycling in both the absence and presence of leaks. Delivered tidal volumes were also assessed. Three patients were simulated: a preterm infant (resistance 100 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 2 mL/cm H2O, inspiratory time of the patient [TI] 400 ms, inspiratory effort 1 and 2 cm H2O), a full-term infant (resistance 50 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 5 mL/cm H2O, TI 500 ms, inspiratory effort 2 and 4 cm H2O), and a child (resistance 30 cm H2O/L/s, compliance 10 mL/cm H2O, TI 600 ms, inspiratory effort 5 and 10 cm H2O). Two PS levels were tested (10 and 15 cm H2O) with and without leaks and with and without the leak compensation algorithm activated. RESULTS Without leaks, only 2 neonatal ventilators and one adult ventilator had trigger delays under a given predefined acceptable limit (1/8 TI). Pressurization showed high variability between ventilators. Most ventilators showed TI in excess high enough to seriously impair patient-ventilator synchronization (> 50% of the TI of the subject). In some ventilators, leaks led to autotriggering and impairment of ventilation performance, but the influence of leaks was generally lower in neonatal ventilators. When a noninvasive ventilation algorithm was available, this was partially corrected. In general, tidal volume was calculated too low by the ventilators in the presence of leaks; the noninvasive ventilation algorithm was able to correct this difference in only 2 adult ventilators. CONCLUSIONS No ventilator performed equally well under all tested conditions for all explored parameters. However, neonatal ventilators tended to perform better in the presence of leaks. These findings emphasize the need to improve algorithms for assisted ventilation modes to better deal with situations of high airway resistance, low pulmonary compliance, and the presence of leaks.","output":"Neonatal and adult ICU ventilators to provide ventilation in neonates, infants, and children: a bench model study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated if people's response to the official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with conspiracy beliefs related to COVID-19, a distrust in the sources providing information on COVID-19, and an endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). METHODS: The sample consisted of 1325 Finnish adults who filled out an online survey marketed on Facebook. Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict people's response to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM are related to people's willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs and a lower trust in information sources were less likely to have a positive response to the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM. These findings highlight the need for governments and health authorities to create communication strategies that build public trust.","output":"Unwillingness to engage in behaviors that protect against COVID-19: the role of conspiracy beliefs, trust, and endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020 COVID-19 has swept across the United States, exposing shortcomings in the current healthcare delivery system.

Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is an excellent tool in rational drug design that takes advantage of accurate methods such as unbiased molecular dynamics (UMD) simulation for designing and optimizing molecular entities by understanding the binding and unbinding pathways of the binders. Supervised molecular dynamics (SuMD) simulation is a branch of UMD in which long-duration simulations are turned into short simulations, called replica, and a specific parameter is monitored throughout the simulation. In this work, we utilized this strategy to reconstruct the unbinding pathway of the anticancer drug dasatinib from its target protein, the c-Src kinase. Several unbinding events with valuable details were achieved. Then, to assess the efficiency and trustworthiness of the SuMD method, the unbinding pathway was also reconstructed by conventional UMD simulation, which uncovered some of the limitations of this method, such as limited sampling of the active site and finding the metastable states in the unbinding pathway.

All Iranian provinces are now affected, although to a different extent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the distance from the epicenter of the infection (Qom) or demographic factors such as population density and the ratio of the elderly population are associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in different Iranian provinces. For the purpose of determining whether the distance from the virus epicenter could be associated with the spread of infection, linear regression analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 software. The association of the incidence of COVID-19 with the population density and the ratio of the population over 65 years old in 31 Iranian provinces was also evaluated. According to our results, a strong association was found between the incidence of COVID-19 in Iranian provinces and their respective distance from Qom (p < 0.001; C = -0.68). The incidence of COVID-19 in Iranian provinces was also positively associated with the ratio of the population over 65 years old (p = 0.002; C = 0.53), while no significant association with population density was found (p = 0.39; C = 0.16). These results suggest that the implementation of travel restrictions from highly affected areas to other provinces could considerably reduce the rate of transmission of the disease throughout the country. Also, provinces with a higher proportion of elderly people (over 65) were identified as particularly at risk for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

We sequenced the complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (collected by the IEDCR in Bangladesh between March and July 2020) and combined these data with 324 publicly available Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh at that time.

Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted that SARS-CoV-2 first emerged during mid-February in Bangladesh, from abroad, with the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported on 8 March 2020. At the end of March 2020, three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity in Bangladesh, combined with the mobility data, revealed that the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) and the rest of the country, disseminated three dominant viral lineages. Further analysis of an additional 85 genomes (November 2020 to April 2021) found that importation of variant of concern Beta (B.1.351) had occurred and that Beta had become dominant in Dhaka.

Studies that reported clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19, stratified by the class of antihypertensives, were included. Random and fixed-effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR). Results: : A total 36 studies involving 30,795 patients with COVID-19 were included. The overall risk of poor patient outcomes (severe COVID-19 or death) was lower in patients taking RAAS inhibitors (OR=0.79, 95% CI: [0.67, 0.95]) compared with those receiving non-RAAS inhibitor antihypertensives. However, further sub-meta-analysis showed that specific RAAS inhibitors did not show a reduction of poor COVID-19 outcomes when compared with any class of antihypertensive except beta-blockers (BBs). For example, compared to calcium channel blockers (CCBs), neither angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR=0.91, 95% CI: [0.67, 1.23]) nor angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR=0.90, 95% CI: [0.62, 1.33]) showed a reduction of poor COVID-19 outcomes.

There was a significant decrease (36.7%) in the 30-day incidence rate of trauma victims presenting to the ED during the lockdown phase (525) compared with the prelockdown phase (830). The 30-day incidence of road traffic accidents (RTA), fall from height, fall on level ground and other trauma decreased by 53.2%, 26%, 23.2% and 12.9%, respectively, while assault cases increased by 8.3% during the lockdown period as compared with the prelockdown period. During the lockdown period, the 30-day incidence of trauma victims with a positive blood alcohol content decreased by 39.6% with a significant drop in the strict lockdown month of April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in the incidence rate of trauma victims, especially RTA and geriatric trauma was seen during the gruelling lockdown period of the COVID 19 pandemic.","output":"Changing pattern of trauma during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The attachment of specific antibody to viral glycoproteins and other structures on the surface of a virus or virus-infected cell has a number of potential consequences to the virus or virus-infected cell.

The physical presence of antibody molecules on the virus surface may interfere with the ability of the virus to infect potentially susceptible cells. Antibody on the surface of virus-infected cells may prevent the maturation and release of virus particles; antibody also can alter certain normal cell functions. The Fc portions of antibody molecules bound to virus-infected cells facilitate interactions with effector cells bearing Fc receptors. In the case of lymphocytes and perhaps phagocytic cells, this interaction may lead to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [51, 58].

The objective of the study was to develop an oligonucleotide microarray for rapid diagnosis of avian diseases that would be used in the course of mass analysis for routine epidemiological surveillance owing to its ability to test one specimen for several infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: The paper describes the technique for rapid and simultaneous diagnosis of avian diseases such as avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis and infectious bursal disease with use of oligonucleotide microarray, conditions for hybridization of fluorescent-labelled viral cDNA on the microarray and its specificity tested with use of AIV, NDV, IBV, IBDV strains as well as biomaterials from poultry. Sensitivity and specificity of the developed microarray was evaluated with use of 122 specimens of biological material: 44 cloacal swabs from sick birds and 78 tissue specimens from dead wild and domestic birds, as well as with use of 15 AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV strains, different in their origin, epidemiological and biological characteristics (RIBSP Microbial Collection). This microarray demonstrates high diagnostic sensitivity (99.16% within 95% CI limits 97.36C100%) and specificity (100%). Specificity of the developed technique was confirmed by direct sequencing of NP and M (AIV), VP2 (IBDV), S1 (IBV), NP (NDV) gene fragments. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic effectiveness of the developed DNA microarray is 99.18% and therefore it can be used in mass survey for specific detection of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV circulating in the region in the course of epidemiological surveillance.

METHODS: An IRB-approved anonymous survey was administered to women receiving screening mammography across six sites in the U.S. and Singapore from October 7, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Using a 1C5 Likert scale, women rated their pre- and post-visit anxiety regarding having their mammogram during the COVID-19 pandemic, importance of observed COVID-19 precautions, and personal risk factors for breast cancer and severe COVID-19 illness. Post-visit change in anxiety was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test associations of pre-visit anxiety with breast cancer and COVID-19 risk factors. RESULTS: In total, 1086 women completed the survey. Of these, 59% (630/1061) had >1 breast cancer risk factor; 27% (282/1060) had >1 COVID-19 risk factors. Forty-two percent (445/1065) experienced pre-visit anxiety. Pre-visit anxiety was independently associated with risk factors for severe COVID-19 (OR for >2 vs 0 risk factors: 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11C3.76) and breast cancer (OR for >2 vs 0 risk factors: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.17C2.50), after adjusting for age and site. Twenty-six percent (272/1065) of women reported post-visit anxiety, an absolute 16% decrease from pre-visit anxiety (95% CI: 14%C19%, P < 0.001).

In recent years, great progress has been made into mRNA vaccine development, especially in individualized tumor vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a promising approach as the production process is simple, safety profiles are better than those of DNA vaccines, and mRNA-encoded antigens are readily expressed in cells. However, mRNA vaccines also possess some inherent limitations. While side effects such as allergy, renal failure, heart failure, and infarction remain a risk, the vaccine mRNA may also be degraded quickly after administration or cause cytokine storms. This is a substantial challenge for mRNA delivery. However, appropriate carriers can avoid degradation and enhance immune responses, effector presentation, biocompatibility and biosafety.

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","output":"A longitudinal and geospatial analysis of COVID-19 tweets during the early outbreak period in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1148/ryct.2020200107.].","output":"Erratum: Extension of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Chest CT and Implications for Chest Radiographic Interpretation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although recent data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to affect the central nervous system (CNS), little is known about the neuropsychiatric effects resulting from this condition. In addition to the well-known neurotrophism of coronaviruses, recent evidence shows also that the cytokine storm induced by the infection is at the basis of the neuroinflammation of the CNS. Furthermore, prolonged hospitalization, polypharmacotherapy, and isolation could be at the basis of the onset of delirium in hospitalized COVID patients. This multicentric observational study explores the incidence of the onset of delirium in an Italian cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. METHODS: Data were collected in the COVIDhospitals of Brescia, Bergamo, Chieti, and Genova. Different socio-demographic, medical, neurological, and pharmacological parameters were collected. As a rapid screening for delirium, the 4AT scale was used. Eighty COVID-19 inpatients (mean age 74.7  14.5 years) met the inclusion criteria (confirmed positivity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus; the presence of delirium and/or psychomotor agitation and/or new onset of other neuropsychiatric symptoms during hospitalization). RESULTS: The majority of these patients (68.8%) had hyperactive delirium subtype. Polypharmacotherapy, current treatment with corticosteroids, and higher age were associated with delirium severity. CONCLUSION: These data provide an insight into the onset of delirium among COVID-19 patients underlining the need for monitoring, especially in elderly patients, the neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the therapy in order to have shorter hospitalization times and better outcomes.","output":"Delirium in COVID-19 patients: a multicentric observational study in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 affected the sports industry with the cancellation of many professional sports competitions worldwide.

Similar to other respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses, it is thought that COVID-19 may impact the cornea. However, its impact on the cornea and anterior segment parameters are currently poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the corneal endothelial cell morphology and anterior segment parameters in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the COVID-19 group comprised 34 patients who had been diagnosed with and recovered from COVID-19, while the control group comprised age- and sex-matched individuals without any systemic or ocular diseases. The endothelial cell density (ECD), coefficient of variation (CV) of cell area, hexagonal cell percentage (HEX), anterior chamber depth (ACD), central corneal thickness (CCT), horizontal anterior chamber diameter (HACD), iridocorneal angle (ICA), horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID), pupillary diameter (PD), and keratometry values (K1 and K2) were analyzed for each participant. The differences in each of these between the groups were analyzed using either an independent samples t test or a MannCWhitney U test based on the normality of the data. RESULTS: Regarding corneal endothelial cell morphology, the ECDs for the COVID-19 and control groups were 2278.50  186.78 cells/mm(2) and 2420.15  222.25 cells/mm(2), respectively (p = 0.002).

Regarding the anterior segment parameters, no significant differences were observed between the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It was hypothesized that individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 would demonstrate a reduction in their endothelial functional preserves.

We found that PCN-224 can be employed as an ECL reporter with a strong signal because of its zirconium-based organic porous frame nanomaterial with a large specific surface area and stable structure. TiO2 nanoparticles were used as an accelerator for the first time to promote the reduction of coreactant potassium peroxydisulfate on the cathode; thus, the initial ECL signal of PCN-224 was significantly amplified. In the presence of PEDV, the ECL signal decreased due to the block effect to electron transfer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were collected and analysed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19 with or without new-onset CVD were compared. RESULTS: Of 219 patients with COVID-19, 10 (4.6%) developed acute ischaemic stroke and 1 (0.5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. COVID-19 with new onset of CVD were significantly older (75.710.8 years vs 52.115.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to present with severe COVID-19 (81.8% vs 39.9%, p<0.01) and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and medical history of CVD (all p<0.05). In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state as reflected in C reactive protein (51.1 (1.3C127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1C212.0) mg/L, p<0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3C20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1C20.0) mg/L, p<0.001).

The other four patients received anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin and 2 of them died. As of 24 March 2020, six patients with CVD died (54.5%).

We here studied the impact of novel improved molecular cut-off hemodialysis filters on systemic microinflammation, uremia and endothelial dysfunction. Human endothelial cells (ECs) were incubated with uremic serum obtained from patients treated with two different hemodialysis regimens in the Permeability Enhancement to Reduce Chronic Inflammation (PERCI-II) crossover clinical trial, comparing High-Flux (HF) and Medium Cut-Off (MCO) membranes, and then assessed for their vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and angiogenesis. Compared to HF membranes, dialysis with MCO membranes lead to a reduction in proinflammatory mediators and reduced endothelial VEGF production and angiogenesis. Cytokine multiplex screening identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily members as promising targets. The influence of TNF- and its soluble receptors (sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2) on endothelial VEGF promoter activation, protein release, and the involved signaling pathways was analyzed, revealing that this detrimental signaling was indeed induced by TNF- and mediated by AP-1/c-FOS signaling. In conclusion, uremic toxins, in particular TNF-signaling, promote endothelial maladaptation, VEGF expression and aberrant angiogenesis, which can be positively modulated by dialysis with novel MCO membranes.

Concerns among dental clinicians over cross-contamination are among the main challenges currently present in the dental profession. This study aimed to assess dental students distress level and attitude towards their professional future following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was carried out recruiting 369 dental students of the Guilan University of Medical Sciences (a census sampling method) using an online questionnaire consisted of the three main topics of students academic status, distress level, and attitude towards their professional future. The students received the link to the questionnaire via instant messaging applications. The Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Spearmans correlation, the chi-squared test, the Fishers exact test, the binomial test, as well as the backward multiple logistic regression model were used for data analysis. Results: The dental students had a low level of distress and a negative attitude towards their professional future. Accordingly, the distress level was significantly higher in females (P < 0.001) than in males. Besides, it had a positive correlation with the academic level. In addition, the attitude of the females and those attending the Rasht Dental School was more significantly negative than that of the males and those attending the Anzali Private Dental School (P = 0.01 and P = 0.009, respectively). Furthermore, attitude had a positive correlation with distress. Conclusion: The subjects showed little distress over the pandemic.

The gig workers are independent workers or temporary contract workers who enter into formal/informal agreements with on-demand companies to provide their services. Rather than employing full-time/permanent employees companies may utilize gig workers as per the demand and work burden, which can minimize the costs incurred in managing permanent employees. However, there is a lack of research on using gig economy in health care, its prospects and the issues involved. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate various prospects in integrating gig economy with the Saudi health-care system. METHODS: An online survey questionnaire instrument including 22 prospects under three categories including organizational competitiveness, resource management, and sustainable development was used for collecting data from 712 health-care decision-makers and practitioners in Saudi Arabia. Findings were analyzed using the statistical means and standard deviations for each item in the questionnaire for analyzing the role of each factor in depth, and t-tests were used for comparing the responses between the groups. RESULTS: T-tests revealed no significant differences among the experts and health-care workers in relation to organizational competitiveness and resource management; however, significant differences in opinions were identified in relation to sustainable development. Individual factors including motivation for Saudization program (mean=4.5, SD=1.15) and creating employment opportunities in rural areas (mean=4.5, SD=1.08), growth in economy (mean=4.4, SD=1.43), increased opportunities for women and disabled (mean=4.4, SD=1.28), and growth in employment (mean=4.3, SD=1.68) were the major prospects identified in relation to the use of gig economy in the Saudi Arabian health-care system.

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses, is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification makes SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the United States; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we provide methods and resources of producing, purifying, fluorescently and APEX2-labeling of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs for the evaluation of mechanisms of viral budding and entry as well as assessment of drug inhibitors under BSL-2 conditions.

Methods The paper is structured along three sets of relations, intended to support analyses that go beyond determinist or instrumental depictions of educational technologies: education-technology, human-technology, and human-education. Findings I outline three key characteristics of educational technologies' function during the pandemic: they were central to the grammar of schooling, their use was widespread across social contexts, and was need-driven rather than innovation-driven. Contribution Accordingly, the paper suggests reorienting existing conceptualizations of educational technologies: (i) rethinking learning-avoiding the portrayal of technologies as solutions to educational problems and examining how they reshape learning;(ii) rethinking context-attending more to how socio-cultural, political, and historical features inform technological affordances;(iii) rethinking teaching-emphasizing adults' role in mediating the normative commitments underlying technology-use, particularly in light of the dominance of commercial platforms and tools.","output":"What kind of revolution?

This study attempted to improve our recognition of postoperative bleeding. METHODS Among 1143 patients undergoing pulmonary resection for pulmonary nodules, ten underwent surgical treatment for postoperative bleeding. Clinical and pathologic data were analyzed. Additionally, the relationship between the bleeding point and an increased amount of drained bloody effusion before the second operation was analyzed. RESULTS The bleeding point was recognized in eight cases: the intercostal artery (n = 4), the lung (n = 2), aberrant vessel of the apex of the lung (n = 1) and the bronchial artery (n = 1). The bleeding points were unknown in two cases in whom the decision to perform a second operation was delayed. Potential reasons or influential factors for bleeding were stapling complications (n = 4), low coagulation ability (n = 2) and intraoperative injury (n = 1). We experienced two cases in which intercostal arterial bleeding was induced by scratching the thoracic wall or the vertebra with the edge of the reinforced stapling line or the sharp edge of a broken staple at the first operation. We divided patients into three groups based on the interval between operations. Bleeding from the arteries seemed to show a higher rate of bleeding per hour than that from the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION The bleeding points and speculated reasons for bleeding varied among patients. We were able to cure all ten cases.

However, conventional solvent extraction involves the excessive use of organic solvents, costly equipment, and tedious operation. These limitations of conventional extraction methods could be prospectively overcome by the carotenoid-pectin hydrocolloidal complexation. The complexation of lycopene and pectin was efficiently promoted in an aqueous environment, resulting in the colloidal complexes that can be subsequently recovered by sedimentation or centrifugation. In this study, the potential of carotenoid-pectin complexation on tomato pomace containing carotenoids and pectin was evaluated. Tomato pomace is a rich source of lycopene, ?-carotene as well as pectin, making it suitable as the raw material for the carotenoid extraction. The extraction of carotenoid and pectin from tomato pomace was optimized using response surface methodology. The maximum recovery was 9.43 mg carotenoid fractions/100 g tomato pomace, while the purity of carotenoid-rich fractions was 92%. The antioxidant capacity of carotenoids extracted from the complexation method was found to be higher than that from the solvent extraction method. Moreover, extraction yield and antioxidant capacity of carotenoid obtained from the carotenoid-pectin complexation were comparable to that from solvent extraction.

Using these hostCpathogen interactions to their advantage, pathogens attach, invade, disseminate, and evade host defense mechanisms to promote their survival in the hostile host environment. Many viruses, bacteria, and parasites express adhesins that bind to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to facilitate their initial attachment and subsequent cellular entry. Some pathogens also secrete virulence factors that modify HSPG expression. HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface of adherent cells and in the extracellular matrix. HSPGs are composed of one or several heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains attached covalently to specific core proteins. For most intracellular pathogens, cell surface HSPGs serve as a scaffold that facilitates the interaction of microbes with secondary receptors that mediate host cell entry. Consistent with this mechanism, addition of HS or its pharmaceutical functional mimic, heparin, inhibits microbial attachment and entry into cultured host cells, and HS-binding pathogens can no longer attach or enter cultured host cells whose HS expression has been reduced by enzymatic treatment or chemical mutagenesis. In pathogens where the specific HS adhesin has been identified, mutant strains lacking HS adhesins are viable and show normal growth rates, suggesting that the capacity to interact with HSPGs is strictly a virulence activity. The goal of this chapter is to provide a mechanistic overview of our current understanding of how certain microbial pathogens subvert HSPGs to promote their infection, using specific HSPGCpathogen interactions as representative examples.","output":"Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans in Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global effort to combat and contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is now proceeding on a war footing.

In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images.

The psychological status of patients was evaluated by DASS-21 questionnaire, while physical functions were determined using medical history, laboratory examination, thoracic computed tomography (CT), and echocardiography. RESULTS: Fifty patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled, and 11 (22%) patients still showed symptoms related to COVID-19. The mean contents (cells/ul) of CD3+ cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T, B lymphocytes and NK cells of the survivors elevated significantly after 6-month discharge (P < 0.001).

Meanwhile, 228, 23, and 14 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained for the ITS2, matK, and rbcL regions, respectively, after bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, no differences were evident between the assembly sequences obtained via shotgun metabarcoding and their corresponding reference sequences of the same species obtained via Sanger sequencing, except for part of the ITS2 and matK assembly sequences of Paeonia lactiflora Pall., Saussurea costus (Falc.)

Dornase alfa is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization. METHODS: Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19including three requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed. RESULTS: Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by critically ill patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are required to formally test the dosing, safety, and efficacy of dornase alfa in COVID-19, and two have recently been registered (NCT04359654 and NCT04355364).

METHODS: Consecutive stage I-III breast cancer patients treated with NET and surgery from January 2009 to December 2019 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Nodal pCR rates were compared between biopsy-proven node-positive patients treated with NET, and HR+/HER2- patients treated with NAC from November 2013 to July 2019. RESULTS: 127 cancers treated with NET and 338 with NAC were included. NET recipients were older, more likely to have lobular and lower-grade tumors, and higher HR expression. With NET, the nodal pCR rate was 11% (4/38) of biopsy-proven cases, and the breast pCR rate was 1.6% (2/126). Nodal-dowstaging rates with NET and NAC were not significantly different (11% vs 18%; P = 0.37).

To reach these objectives, data from a web survey conducted in Brazil and Spain was analyzed. The main outcome was risky drinking assessed by the AUDIT-C. Lifestyle was measured using the Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation (SMILE). Fixed logistic models were used to evaluate associations between lifestyle and risky drinking. Between April and May 2020, 22,785 individuals answered the survey. The prevalence of risky drinking was 45.6% in Brazil and 30.8% in Spain. The SMILE score was lower (unhealthier lifestyle) among at-risk drinkers.

The first cohort was a case-control analysis of 10 non-ventilated moderately to severely hypoxic COVID-19 patients who received IVIG (Privigen) matched 1:2 with 20 control patients of similar age, body mass index (BMI), degree of hypoxemia, and co-morbidities. The second cohort consisted of patients enrolled in a previously published randomized open-label prospective study of 14 COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care (SOC) versus 13 patients who received SOC plus IVIG (Octagam 10%). Results: Among the first case control population, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $21,982 per IVIG-treated case versus $42,431 per case for matched non-IVIG receiving controls, representing a net cost reduction of $20,449 (48%) per case.

CONCLUSION When sevoflurane is administered with tidal volume approximating the airway dead space volume, end-tidal sevoflurane and end-tidal carbon dioxide may not correctly reflect the concentration of these gases in the alveoli, leading to misinterpretation of expired gas data.","output":"Effects of inhalational anaesthesia with low tidal volume ventilation on end-tidal sevoflurane and carbon dioxide concentrations: prospective randomized study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has put much of the world into lockdown, as one unintended upside to this response, the air quality has been widely reported to have improved worldwide. Existing studies examine the environmental effect of lockdowns at a city- or country-level, few examines it from a global perspective. Using a novel COVID-19 government response tracker dataset, combining the daily air pollution data and weather data across 597 major cities worldwide between January 1, 2020, and July 5, 2020, this study quantifies the causal impacts of 8 types of lockdown measures on changes of a range of individual pollutants based on a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23-37%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14-20%), SO2 (2-20%), PM2.5 (7-16%), and CO (7-11%), but the O3 increases 10-27%. Furthermore, intra/intercity travel restrictions have a better performance in curbing air pollution. These results are robust to a set of alternative specifications, including different panel sizes, independent variables, estimation strategies. The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the lockdown effects are more remarkable in cities from lower-income, more industrialized, and populous countries. We also do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 99,270 to 146,649 among 76 countries and regions involved in this study during the COVID-19 lockdown.

One of the ways for prevention of Covid-19 is by disabling its spike protein which results in inhibiting its binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The other alternative is to inhibit its replication once inside the body. The aim of this study was to explore the literature to identify whether there were any Ayurvedic remedies which contained ingredients which demonstrated this dual effect. METHODS: :In silico studies were carried out to find the structures of the targets i.e. spike protein of the virus and its main protease (Mpro). Databases were searched to identify the composition of Ayurvedic decoctions used for respiratory ailments. RESULTS: : We have found that two components out of 26 active ingredients of Ayurvedic decoction are strong binders for spike protein as well as corresponding Mpro (3CL protease) which plays an essential role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive antiviral drug target. Out of 26 components of Ayurvedic herbal decoction used for influenza, one compound was found to be most active. It is a well-known antioxidant, antinflammatory and hepatoprotective molecule.

Moreover, we measured cytokine mRNA expression in lung and spleen samples. Broilers were inoculated with IBV H120 vaccine or virulent M41 and challenged 5 days later with E. coli 506. A PBS control and E. coli group without previous virus inoculation were also included. Birds were sacrificed at various time points after inoculation (h/dpi). Inoculation with IBV induced extended and more severe colibacillosis than with E. coli alone. At 4 dpi, the number of KUL-01(+) PBMC in all E. coli-inoculated groups was significantly higher than in PBS-inoculated birds, which correlated with lesion scores. From 1 to 4 dpi, NO production by PBMC from all E. coli-inoculated animals was elevated compared to PBS birds. Bactericidal activity of PBMC in IBV-inoculated animals at 7 dpi was lower than in PBS- and E. coli-inoculated birds, but phagocytic capacity and recruitment were not severely impaired. In spleen samples of IBV-infected animals reduced expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and IFN- mRNA was found 1 dpi.

Researchers find evidences that regions with more immigrants from the new member states of the European Union (EU hereinafter) in eastern Europe tended to vote more in favor of Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Similar relations between the size of immigrant population and anti-immigration attitudes or far-right voting are found in other richer EU member states. A common explanation for this relation is the concern that immigrants negatively affect the outcome in the host labor market. Immigration is drawing attention in Korea too. Although immigrants' share in population is still substantially smaller in Korea than in the EU, its increase is noticeable. Also, certain industries in Korea are known to be already heavily reliant on immigrant labor. Recently, as entry into the country was tightened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, firms and farms are reported to have faced a disruption in production. This trend of increasing presence of immigrants in population and in the labor market, vis--vis the low fertility rate and rapid aging in Korea, is raising interest and concern on the socioeconomic impact of immigration.To offer some reference for the debates related to immigration in Korea, KIEP researchers (Joe et al. 2020 and Joe and Moon 2021) look at the EU, where immigrants' presence was much higher from much earlier on, and where the greater heterogeneity among the immigrants allows for richer analyses.

More precisely, it presents the basics of a theory of contextuality called Contextuality-by-Default (CbD). One of the main tenets of CbD is that the identity of a random variable is determined not only by its content (that which is measured or responded to) but also by contexts, systematically recorded conditions under which the variable is observed; and the variables in different contexts possess no joint distributions. I explain why this principle has no paradoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic\\"everything depends on everything else\\"view. Contextuality is defined as the difference between two differences: (1) the difference between content-sharing random variables when taken in isolation, and (2) the difference between the same random variables when taken within their contexts. Contextuality thus defined is a special form of context-dependence rather than a synonym for the latter. The theory applies to any empirical situation describable in terms of random variables. Deterministic situations are trivially noncontextual in CbD, but some of them can be described by systems of epistemic random variables, in which random variability is replaced with epistemic uncertainty.

Results of blood sample analysis from 359 cats during a 1-year period at the University of Glasgow Veterinary Haematology Laboratory were examined. Smear estimates of platelet number were done in those cases in which records did not indicate adequate platelet numbers. Platelet counts obtained with an impedance counter (Minos Vet, Abx Hematologie) were <200X10(9) cells/L in 256 samples (71%) and <50X10(9) cells/L in 43 samples (12%). However, based on estimation of platelet numbers from blood smears, only 11 samples (3.1%) had platelet counts of <200X10(9) cells/L and 9 samples (2.5%) had counts of <50X10(9) cells/L. Four cats with thrombocytopenia estimated by blood smear evaluation had clinical signs of a bleeding disorder. Disorders associated with thrombocytopenia included neoplasia, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and infectious diseases. There was no evidence that delay due to mailing of samples was associated with lower automated platelet counts than would have been obtained on the day of sampling.

It remains unknown whether nursing studies utilizing complex methodology like sleep actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be conducted remotely without compromising data quality. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (a) disseminate our remote study protocol for sleep actigraphy and EMA data from hospital nurses during COVID-19, (b) assess feasibility and acceptability of this approach for studies on hospital nurses, and (c) examine the reliability and ecological validity of sleep characteristics measured across 14 days. METHODS: Using an online platform, we provided 86 outpatient nurses from a cancer hospital with detailed video/text instructions regarding the study and facilitated virtual study onboarding meetings. Feasibility was assessed by comparing adherence rates to a similar in-person study of nurses from the same hospital; acceptability was evaluated through content analysis of qualitative study feedback. Multilevel modeling was conducted to assess changes in sleep characteristics as a function of study day and daily stressful experiences. RESULTS: Adherence to EMA (91.8%) and actigraphy (97.9%) was high. EMA adherence was higher than the in-person study of inpatient day-shift nurses from the same hospital. Content analyses revealed primarily positive feedback, with 51.2% reporting \\"easy, clear, simple onboarding\\" and 16.3% reporting the website was \\"helpful.\\" Six participants provided only negative feedback. Sleep characteristics did not change as a function of study day except for self-reported quality, which increased slightly during Week 1 and regressed toward baseline after that. A higher incidence of stressor days or higher stressor severity followed nights with shorter-than-usual time in bed or poorer-than-usual sleep quality, supporting the ecological validity for these methods of assessing sleep in nurses. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that a fully remote study protocol for EMA and actigraphy studies in nursing yields robust feasibility, acceptability, reliability, and validity.

We aimed to understand the scale, nature, and duration of changes to admissions for different types of acute coronary syndrome in England and to evaluate whether in-hospital management of patients has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analysed data on hospital admissions in England for types of acute coronary syndrome from Jan 1, 2019, to May 24, 2020, that were recorded in the Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care database. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), myocardial infarction of unknown type, or other acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina). We identified revascularisation procedures undertaken during these admissions (ie, coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], PCI, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). We calculated the numbers of weekly admissions and procedures undertaken; percentage reductions in weekly admissions and across subgroups were also calculated, with 95% CIs. Findings Hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome declined from mid-February, 2020, falling from a 2019 baseline rate of 3017 admissions per week to 1813 per week by the end of March, 2020, a reduction of 40% (95% CI 37C43). This decline was partly reversed during April and May, 2020, such that by the last week of May, 2020, there were 2522 admissions, representing a 16% (95% CI 13C20) reduction from baseline. During the period of declining admissions, there were reductions in the numbers of admissions for all types of acute coronary syndrome, including both STEMI and NSTEMI, but relative and absolute reductions were larger for NSTEMI, with 1267 admissions per week in 2019 and 733 per week by the end of March, 2020, a percent reduction of 42% (95% CI 38C46). In parallel, reductions were recorded in the number of PCI procedures for patients with both STEMI (438 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 346 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 21%, 95% CI 12C29) and NSTEMI (383 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 240 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 37%, 29C45). The median length of stay among patients with acute coronary syndrome fell from 4 days (IQR 2C9) in 2019 to 3 days (1C5) by the end of March, 2020. Interpretation Compared with the weekly average in 2019, there was a substantial reduction in the weekly numbers of patients with acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to hospital in England by the end of March, 2020, which had been partly reversed by the end of May, 2020. The reduced number of admissions during this period is likely to have resulted in increases in out-of-hospital deaths and long-term complications of myocardial infarction and missed opportunities to offer secondary prevention treatment for patients with coronary heart disease.

BACKGROUND The risk of cerebral embolization persists throughout the carotid artery stenting procedure and remains during the stent healing period. METHODS A total of 30 consecutive patients (age 71.6  7.6 years, 63% male) meeting the conventional carotid artery stenting inclusion criteria were enrolled in 4 centers in Germany and Poland. RESULTS The primary combined endpoint was the procedure success of the CGuard system and the number and volume of new lesions on the ipsilateral side assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 48 h post-procedure and at 30 days. The secondary endpoint was 30-day major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (death, stroke, or myocardial infarction). Protection devices were used in all procedures. Procedure success was 100%, with 0% procedural complications. The 30-day major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events rate was 0%. New ipsilateral ischemic lesions at 48 h occurred in 37.0% of patients and the average lesion volume was 0.039  0.08 cm(3).

The paper concludes by examining the current crisis in which a fragmented professoriate is facing market-driven working conditions, exacerbated by the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The procedure requires a small amount of S-protein/RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). A high-throughput, simple ELISA technique is employed. Plate-coated-RBDs are allowed to interact with the serum, then soluble ACE2 is added, followed by secondary antibodies and substrate. The key steps in this procedure include: 1) serum heat treatment to prevent non-specific interactions, 2) proper use of blank controls to detect side reactions and eliminate secondary antibody cross-reactivity, 3) the addition of an optimal amount of saturating ACE2 to maximize sensitivity and prevent non-competitive co-occurrence of RBD-ACE2 binding and neutralization, and 4) mechanistically derived neutralization calculation using a calibration curve. Even manually, the protocol can be completed in 16 hours for >30 serum samples;this includes the 7.5 hours of incubation time. This automatable, high-throughput, competitive ELISA assay can screen a large number of sera, and does not require sterile conditions or special containment measures, as live viruses are not employed. In comparison to the gold standard assays (virus neutralization titers (VNT) or plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT)), which are laborious, time-consuming and require special containment measures due to their use of live viruses. This simple, alternative neutralization efficacy assay can be a great asset for initial vaccine development stages. The assay successfully passed conventional validation parameters (sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy) and results with moderately neutralizing murine sera correlated with VNT assay results (R 2 =0.975, n=25), demonstrating high sensitivity.","output":"Detection and Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Neutralization by a Sensitive Competitive ELISA Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current Covid-19 era, personal protective equipment (PPE) is difficult to find and very much needed by medical personnel in service People also need PPE to maintain health Mask is one of the PPEs that is difficult to find and buy Mostly, pharmacies run out of it and if there is any, the price goes up highly UNNES, as a university, formed a COVID-19 Task Force during the Covid-19 period to help prevent the disease spread in the internal campus community The UNNES Covid-19 Task Force prepared 3000 hand sanitizers and disinfectants, and 5100 masks for lecturers and staff Fashion Design Major of Home Economics Department of Engineering Faculty of UNNES is appointed by the university to design and produce cloth masks to be distributed to lecturers and educational staff The production of these UNNES non-medical masks went viral on social media and was even covered by a famous social media account named Lambe Turah With various limitations, they produced 2-layer masks with pleated design on the outer side and a pocket on the inside that can be filled with a sheet of tissue as a filter In addition, they also produced 2-layer cloth masks A total of 4500 masks have been distributed to lecturers and staff for use Moreover, there are 600 more masks that still need to be studied from the aspect of function, comfort and aesthetic and need to be tested in laboratory, particularly in the aspect of dust, microbes and air, as well as sterilization Based on the above conditions, it is necessary to conduct research related to the analysis of mask quality developed and produced by Home Economics Department of Engineering Faculty of UNNES during the Covid-19 period This study aims to describe the quality of cloth masks from the aspect of comfort and medical, such as the mask permeability and sterilization The research approach was a survey based on user evaluation and experimentation through laboratory tests The survey used a questionnaire via Google form to reveal the assessment of masks from the aspect of comfort Experiments were carried out through sample tests for air permeability and sterilization in the health laboratory of PT Sucofindo, Semarang The result of the research with respondents from lecturers and educational staff showed that the masks that had a very high quality is 50 71%;the ones with high quality is 37 14%;those which are moderate in quality is 3 51 and 0 71 had low quality The laboratory test result of the UNNES non-medical mask based on the air permeability aspect showed that it had low air absorption because when it was tested using fire blow test, the fire did not go out The sterility test results for non-medical cloth masks showed that they were not yet sterile Non-medical masks already have very good quality in terms of comfort, function and aesthetic as well as low air absorption so that they are very useful for lecturers and staff to maintain health from the escalating Covid-19 pandemic New non-medical cloth mask products are not sterile Therefore, a thorough clean-up is required before using ?

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3-98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0-10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users. The results of empirical studies demonstrate that by constantly inputting medical knowledge into the system, the proposed method will be capable to detect unknown diseases from existing ones and perform an early response to the initial outbreaks.","output":"Unknown Disease Outbreaks Detection: A Pilot Study on Feature-Based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the situation where expansion of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) does not stop, there is concern about co-infection of people with the seasonal influenza infections from late autumn to winter 2020.

Since we recently demonstrated that both CRV431 and NV556 also inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in nonviral-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis mouse models, our present data suggest that the two entirely structurally different CypIsCRV431 and NV556derived from unrelated natural products, represent attractive partners to current direct-acting agent (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C and liver diseases.","output":"Structurally distinct cyclosporin and sanglifehrin analogs CRV431 and NV556 suppress established HCV infection in humanized-liver mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW There is a need for improved diagnosis and for optimal classification of patients with infectious diseases. An alternative approach to the pathogen-detection strategy is based on a comprehensive analysis of the host response to the infection. This review focuses on the value of transcriptome analyses of blood leukocytes for the diagnosis and management of patients with infectious diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Initial studies showed that RNA from blood leukocytes of children with acute viral and bacterial infections carried pathogen-specific transcriptional signatures. Subsequently, transcriptional signatures for several other infections have been described and validated in humans with malaria, dengue, salmonella, melioidosis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV. In addition, transcriptome analyses represent an invaluable tool to understand disease pathogenesis and to objectively classify patients according to the clinical severity. SUMMARY Microarray studies have been shown to be highly reproducible using different platforms, and in different patient populations, confirming the value of blood transcriptome analyses to study pathogen-specific host immune responses in the clinical setting. Combining the detection of the pathogen with a comprehensive assessment of the host immune response will provide a new understanding of the correlations between specific causative agents, the host response, and the clinical manifestations of the disease.","output":"Detecting specific infections in children through host responses: a paradigm shift."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health insurance industry in China is undergoing great shocks and profound impacts induced by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

This short series demonstrates our experience in managing COVID-19 disease in renal transplant patients in the absence of strong evidence. We report 8 cases of kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 (median age = 48.5 years; range = 21-71 years), including 4 males and 4 females. The most frequently associated comorbidity was hypertension. The most common presenting features were fever and cough. The main radiological investigation was a portable chest X-ray. Other common features included lymphopenia, high C-reactive protein, and a very high ferritin level. Overall, 1 patient was managed as an outpatient, the remaining 7 required hospital admission, 1 of them referred to the intensive therapy unit. Management included supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy, monitoring renal function, and symptomatic treatment with or without ward-based oxygen therapy depending on oxygen saturation) and discontinuation of the antiproliferative immunosuppressive drugs. Seven patients recovered and discharged home to self-isolate. One patient required intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation. Supportive treatment could be sufficient for the management or to be tried first.

It is posing a serious health and economic challenge worldwide. However, case fatality rates (CFRs) have varied amongst various countries ranging from 0 to 8.91%. We have evaluated the effect of selected socio-economic and health indicators to explain this variation in CFR. Countries reporting a minimum of 50 cases as on 14th March 2020, were selected for this analysis. Data about the socio-economic indicators of each country was accessed from the World bank database and data about the health indicators were accessed from the World Health Organisation (WHO) database. Various socioeconomic indicators and health indicators were selected for this analysis. After selecting from univariate analysis, the indicators with the maximum correlation were used to build a model using multiple variable linear regression with a forward selection of variables and using adjusted R-squared score as the metric. We found univariate regression results were significant for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, POD 30/70 (Probability Of Dying Between Age 30 And Exact Age 70 From Any of Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Diabetes or Chronic Respiratory Disease), HCI (Human Capital Index), GNI(Gross National Income) per capita, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10000 population, as these parameters negatively corelated with CFR (rho = -0.48 to -0.38 , p<0.05). Case fatality rate was regressed using ordinary least squares (OLS) against the socio-economic and health indicators. The indicators in the final model were GDP per capita, POD 30/70, HCI, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10,000, median age, current health expenditure per capita, number of confirmed cases and population in millions.

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is mainly used for respiratory virus detection owing to its high sensitivity and reproducibility. In response, a multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1C4 (PIV1-4), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. Detection ability of RT-PCR assay was confirmed by applying it to a portable device capable of point-of-care testing (POCT). Amplicons were synthesized using primer pairs and probe sets designed for each target virus, and a standard curve was constructed to confirm the limit of detection. An experiment using nasopharyngeal swab samples was conducted to understand the field applicability of the rRT-PCR assay. Detection was confirmed in most samples. This study demonstrated that rapid and accurate detection results can be obtained using the multiplex rRT-PCR based POC test, and that it is possible to detect 14 types of respiratory viruses that are generally difficult to distinguish at the same time, enabling timely treatment.

METHODS The data of N=1,715 rehabilitation inpatients who completed the rehabilitation before the lockdown in 2019 and N=707 rehabilitation inpatients who began in 2020 after the lockdown of the clinic due to the pandemic (during the COVID-19 phase) from March to Mai 2020 are compared in reference to their sample characteristics and their results in patient reported outcomes. RESULTS There are no significant differences between the two observed time periods in reference to the sociodemographic characteristics of the rehabilitation inpatients. At the beginning of the rehabilitation there was no significant difference in the scale somatization. There was a significantly higher score in the scales' anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 phase, but only to the extent of a small effect. The results of the scales of activity and participation (ICF 3 F AT) as well as functionality (WHODAS 2.0) do not differ in the time periods at the beginning of the rehabilitation. However, rehabilitation inpatients with low socioeconomic status (rehabilitation allowance or disability pension) have critical scores in some scales.

Whether they originated in Han or Daic people, there is no consensus. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of this group: (1) the Han Chinese origin, (2) the ancient Daic origin, (3) and the admixture between Daic and Han. This study addressed this issue by analyzing the paternal Y chromosome and maternal mtDNA variation of 62 Fujian Tanka and 25 neighboring Han in Fujian. The southern East Asian predominant haplogroups (e.g., Y-chromosome O1a1a-P203 and O1b1a1a-M95, and mtDNA F2a, M7c1, and F1a1) had relatively high frequencies in Tanka. The interpopulation comparison revealed that the Tanka have a closer affinity with Daic populations than with Han Chinese in paternal lineages but are closely clustered with southern Han populations such as Hakka and Chaoshanese in maternal lineages. Network and haplotype-sharing analyses also support the admixture hypothesis. The Fujian Tanka mainly originate from the ancient indigenous Daic people and have only limited gene flows from Han Chinese populations. Notably, the divergence time inferred by the Tanka-specific haplotypes indicates that the formation of Fujian Tanka was a least 1033.8-1050.6 years before present (the early Northern Song dynasty), indicating that they are an indigenous population, not late Daic migrants from southwestern China.","output":"Uniparental Genetic Analyses Reveal the Major Origin of Fujian Tanka from Ancient Indigenous Daic Populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary we propose four questions to be addressed while building a meaningful public primary healthcare response in Lebanon today.

In order to identify how these questions are related to the need to be working short and long, we look at the imprints left by past and present shocks.

Then, we consider how two present shocks -- the economic breakdown and the blast of ammonium nitrate in Beirut port -- are affecting and threatening the progress made by the PHCN to ensure that primary healthcare remains a public good, a fragile space acquired with difficulty in the past half century. We identify what questions emerge from the combined consequences of such traumas, when the immediate constraints of the present meet the impediments of the past.

RESULTS: Overall, 317 individuals were enrolled. Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317). The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%). Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%). An 'atypical' presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%). Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury. During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275). On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10; p < 0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission. Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.","output":"Clinical characteristics, management and in-hospital mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Genoa, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic public health and social protective measures imposed globally resulted in partial or full closure of key services and supports for services and supports for people with a disability, chronic illness or age-related dependency. This caused huge disruption to care provision and family carers were relied upon to assume this care at home. Many family carers, including those in employment, found themselves navigating additional care responsibilities without 'usual levels' of support from family, friends, work, school, day care services, homecare and community services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family carers, their employment and care-giving responsibilities, through the lens of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989). Adopting a qualitative research approach, 16 family carers (14 females, 2 males) who were in employment prior to the onset of or during the pandemic, participated in an in-depth, semi-structured telephone or online video interview between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 45 and 100 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified four main themes: colliding worlds; navigating unchartered waters alone; opportunity despite adversity and the relentless unknowing. Findings indicate that the onset of the pandemic resulted in the sudden loss of valued resources, which disrupted routines and caused care and work life domains to become intrinsically intertwined. Consistent with the main principles of the COR theory, adapting and transitioning to different ways of working and caring with depleted resources and supports, generated considerable stress for family carers and impacted their well-being. The implications for employers, healthcare providers, policy makers and other key stakeholders are considered, to enable family carers to successfully reconcile work with care and protect their well-being, as the pandemic continues to unfold and in the event of future societal crises.","output":"Colliding worlds: Family carers' experiences of balancing work and care in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We comment on science advice in the political context of the Philippines during the COVID 19 pandemic.

From the result, it is assertive that daily recovery from COVID-19 eases financial stress, while the reported daily deaths from COVID-19 further hamper financial stress in the country. Moreover, the uncertainty of the USA' economic policy has also cost the Americans more financial stress and other socio-economic challenges.

Relevant data were systematically gathered from three databases, viz., Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus. The information obtained included botanical information, extraction method and extracts concentrations, as well as the proposed mechanisms. Fourteen articles describing 30 different plants met our eligibility criteria. Random effects model and subgroup analysis were applied to investigate heterogeneity. According to subgroup analysis, the substantial heterogeneity of the estimated mean based on the IC50 values reporting the most potent anti-SARS-CoV 3C--like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors (10.07 %, p < 0.0001), was significantly higher compared to the most active anti-SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors (6.12 %, p < 0.0001). More importantly, the literature analysis revealed that fruit extracts of Rheum palmatum L. and the compound cryptotanshinone isolated from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (IC50 = 0.8  0.2 mol LC1) were excellent candidates for anti--SARS-CoV targeting PLpro. Meanwhile, iguesterin (IC50 = 2.6  0.6 mol LC1) isolated from the bark of Tripterygium regelii emerged as the most excellent candidate for anti-SARS--CoV targeting 3CLpro.

We performed multiple linear regression analyses to assess which regulation strategies were associated with individual differences in perceived stress. Among all emotion regulation strategies, psychological distancing, which involves thinking about stressful circumstances in an objective, impartial way, was uniquely associated with reductions in perceived stress due to COVID-19 across individuals. This effect was not moderated by age, gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or trait-related difficulty in regulating emotion. Conversely, situation modification was associated with significantly greater perceived stress overall.

However, there is limited strategic planning or policy initiatives to address this groups vulnerability resulting in several public health ethical issues that need to be considered and addressed. This article aims to develop a public health ethics framework for the geriatric community with the purpose to review ethical implications when working with the geriatric community. METHODS: The Q-methodology was selected for data collection. Fifteen statements were ranked by means of a five-point Likert-scale questionnaire. Twenty-two participants from six geriatric institutions participated in the ranking of the statements. RESULTS: The ranking of the statements confirmed the need for a public health ethics framework to provide guidance when working with the geriatric community and to evaluate decisions about geriatric care. Such a framework should be application-based and practice-oriented which can assist in addressing unfamiliarity with public health ethics in general and can extend the capacity for decision-making. The ranking of these statements contributed to the scope of the planned framework, by considering the vulnerability of healthcare practitioners (as community of practitioners) and the geriatric community as a basis from which to promote justice in public health programmes. CONCLUSION: Based on the ranking of statements, eight building blocks for a public health ethics framework were identified. The building blocks are imbedded in professional ethics and care ethics.

The increase in energy required for a gestating cow to compensate for a muddy environment is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of muddy conditions on cow body weight (BW) and fetal growth during late gestation. Sixteen multiparous Angus cows (n = 8/treatment) were paired based on initial BW and one cow from each pair was randomly allocated to either the mud (MUD) or control (CON) treatment on day 213 of gestation. Pens in the CON group were bedded with wood chips, while pens in the MUD group were designed to create a muddy lot (average depth of 23.6  5.8 cm). Cows were housed outdoors individually and fed the same diet that consisted of a limit-fed total mixed ration. Each pair was fed to meet energy and protein requirements for maintenance and gestation. From day 213 to 269 of gestation, cows were weighed and sampled for blood metabolites weekly. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with repeated measurements (SAS 9.4). Though cows consumed the same amount of dry matter, cows in the MUD treatment weighed 37.4 kg less than cows in the CON treatment (P < 0.01) by day 269 of gestation. Cows in the MUD treatment decreased approximately half a body condition score (BCS), while cows in the CON treatment gained approximately 1 BCS during the treatment period (P < 0.01). There was no evidence of a treatment  day of gestation effect for 12th rib back fat (P = 0.85), rump fat (P = 0.48), total plasma protein concentrations (P = 0.85), or plasma 3-methylhistidine (P = 0.84); however, there was a marginally significant treatment  day of gestation effect for plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentration (P = 0.09). Despite differences in cow BW at the end of the treatment period, calf birth weight (P = 0.66) and calf total plasma protein (P = 0.27) were not different; however, the divergence in cow BW remained marginally significant at parturition (P = 0.06).

Low-resource, rural communities often lack programmes for early identification and intervention. The Prechtl General Movement Assessment (GMA) is regarded as the best clinical tool to predict cerebral palsy in infants <5 months. In addition, children with developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, late detected genetic disorders or autism spectrum disorder show abnormal general movements (GMs) during infancy. General Movement Assessment in Neonates for Early Identification and Intervention, Social Support and Health Awareness (G.A.N.E.S.H.) aims to (1) provide evidence as to whether community health workers can support the identification of infants at high-risk for neurological and developmental disorders and disabilities, (2) monitor further development in those infants and (3) initiate early and targeted intervention procedures. METHODS: This 3-year observational cohort study will comprise at least 2000 infants born across four districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Community health workers, certified for GMA, video record and assess the infants' GMs twice, that is, within 2 months after birth and at 3-5 months. In case of abnormal GMs and/or reduced MOSs, infants are further examined by a paediatrician and a neurologist. If necessary, early intervention strategies (treatment as usual) are introduced. After paediatric and neurodevelopmental assessments at 12-24 months, outcomes are categorised as normal or neurological/developmental disorders. Research objective (1): to relate the GMA to the outcome at 12-24 months. Research objective (2): to investigate the impact of predefined exposures. Research objective (3): to evaluate the interscorer agreement of GMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: G.A.N.E.S.H. received ethics approval from the Indian Government Chief Medical Officers of Varanasi and Mirzapur and from the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service in Varanasi. GMA is a worldwide used diagnostic tool, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz, Austria (27-388 ex 14/15).

Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition) issued by National Health and Commission of China and The Experts Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hanks solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.","output":"Inactivating porcine coronavirus before nuclei acid isolation with the temperature higher than 56 C damages its genome integrity seriously"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for mental health care despite novel barriers to services.

Multiple frameworks have been proposed to mine, store, preprocess, and analyze physiological vitals data using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, less research has been done to collect potentially high volume, high-quality big data in an organized, time-synchronized, and holistic manner to solve similar problems in multiple fields. Although a large number of data collection devices exist in the form of sensors. They are either highly specialized, univariate and fragmented in nature or exist in a lab setting. The current study aims to propose artificial intelligence-based body sensor network framework (AIBSNF), a framework for strategic use of body sensor networks (BSN), which combines with real-time location system (RTLS) and wearable biosensors to collect multivariate, low noise, and high-fidelity data. This facilitates gathering of time-synchronized location and physiological vitals data, which allows artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based time series analysis. The study gives a brief overview of wearable sensor technology, RTLS, and provides use cases of AI/ML algorithms in the field of sensor fusion. The study also elaborates sample scenarios using a specific sensor network consisting of pressure sensors (insoles), accelerometers, gyroscopes, ECG, EMG, and RTLS position detectors for particular applications in the field of health care and sports.

Per stakeholder group, participants were interviewed to generate statements. Next, each participant sorted these statements on relatedness and importance. For each group, a concept map was created, using cluster analysis. Finally, focus group discussions were held to refine the maps. The three concept maps resulted in several clustered ideas that stakeholders had in common, grouped by thematic analysis into the following meta-clusters: (A) Employees experience of autonomy in work (employees responsibility, freedom to exert control, meaningful work), (B) Supervisor support (being proactive, connected, and involved), (C) Ways to match employees capacities to work (job accommodations), (D) Safe social climate in workplace (transparent organizational culture, collective responsibility in teams, collegial support), and (E) professional and organizational support, including collaboration with occupational health professionals. Promoting stay at work is a dynamic process that requires joined efforts by workplace stakeholders, in which more attention is needed to the interpersonal dynamics between employer and employee.

The use of SN in the Middle Eastern HE sector has the capacity to promote and motivate students to acquire professional and personal skills for their studies and future workplace; however, the use of SN by tertiary students is also associated with several risks: isolation, depression, privacy, and security. Furthermore, culture is influenced by using SN use, since some countries shifted from one dimension to another based on Hofstede's cultural framework. The study new findings are based on a sample at a specific point in time within a culture.

The present study aimed to investigate perceived stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by ICU staff working directly with COVID-19 patients. Methods: The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress, the PTSD Diagnostic Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5 th edition) was used to determine PTSD symptoms, and a sociodemographic questionnaire was used to record different sociodemographic variables. Results: Altogether, 124 participants (57.2% of whom were men) were included in the analysis. The majority of participants perceived working in the ICU with COVID-19 patients as moderately to severely stressful. Moreover, 71.4% of doctors and 74.4% of nurses experienced moderate to severe perceived stress. The staff with previous ICU experience were less likely to have a probable diagnosis of PTSD than those without previous ICU experience. Conclusions: Assessing perceived stress levels and PTSD among ICU staff may enhance our understanding of COVID-19-induced mental health challenges. Specific strategies to enhance ICU staffs mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should be employed and monitored regularly.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the risk of new-onset diabetes after COVID-19 through a population follow-up study. Methods All COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea from January 20 to June 4, 2020, were matched with national health insurance data and their health screening data, both provided by the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. Controls were selected as the people who received the PCR test for COVID-19 and showed negative results in the same period and followed up until July 19, 2020. We selected the outcome as the diagnosis of diabetes according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10, E10 C E14). People who were diagnosed with diabetes in the past five years were excluded from both groups. After performing a log-rank test between groups, adjusted incidence rate and hazard ratio were estimated using Cox proportional hazard modeling. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, region, family histories of hypertension/diabetes, and income) and underlying health conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and BMI were adjusted. Proportional assumptions were tested by the zph test and the sensitivity analysis by excluding each factor in turn and comparing results. Results A total of 6,247 COVID-19 patients and 143,594 controls without diabetes in the past were included for the analysis. The number of new-onset diabetes were 759 (12.15%) in COVID-19 patients and 3,465 (2.41%) in controls (P < 0.01). The adjusted incidence of diabetes was 15.34 (95% confidence interval, CI: 14.10 C 16.66) and 11.18 (95% CI: 10.67 C 11.72) per 100 person-year, respectively, with the mean follow-up time as 46.31 (standard deviation: 16.37) days. The adjusted hazard ratio of diabetes in COVID-19 cases was 2.97 (95% CI: 2.44 C 3.63). Conclusion Since COVID-19 patients showed a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes in a short-time follow-up, we should consider diabetes as one of the possible complications of COVID-19.

The inability to use tactile senses makes it difficult for surgeons to locate lesions during laparoscopic surgery. Endoscopic India ink marking techniques are often used in laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery. We present our experience with performing LPC with India ink during the surgical resection of various bladder lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS LPC with cystoscopic fine needle tattooing was performed on 10 patients at our institute. Tattooing was performed at 1- to 2-cm intervals approximately 1 cm away from the outer margin of the lesion with enough depth (the deep muscle layer) under cystoscopic guidance. LPC was performed by the transperitoneal approach. The clinical courses and pathologic results were analyzed. RESULTS All LPC with cystoscopic tattooing cases were performed successfully. The mean patient age was 39.1 years. The mean operative time was 130.5 minutes, and the mean estimated blood loss was 93 ml. The mean hospital stay was 13.1 days, and the mean duration of indwelling Foley catheterization was 10.7 days. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications except 1 case of delayed urinary leak and 1 case of delayed wound healing. The pathological diagnosis included 1 urachal cancer, 1 urachal remnant, 4 urachal cysts, 2 pheochromocytomas, and 2 inflammatory masses. All specimens showed adequate surgical margins.

Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes-larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property-and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: city-wide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica.

We used a multivariable Bayesian model to estimate the probability of needing critical care. RESULTS: The study enrolled 350 children from March 12, 2020, to July 1, 2020: 292 (83.4%) and 214 (73.7%) were considered to have relevant COVID-19, of whom 24.2% required critical care. Four major clinical syndromes of decreasing severity were identified: multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) (17.3%), bronchopulmonary (51.4%), gastrointestinal (11.6%), and mild syndrome (19.6%). Main risk factors were high C-reactive protein and creatinine concentration, lymphopenia, low platelets, anemia, tachycardia, age, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and low oxygen saturation.

RESULTS: 827 clinicians participated, mostly physiotherapists (82%) working in Australia (70%). Most (71%, 587/827) reported reduced revenue (mean (SD) 62% (24.7%)) since the pandemic commenced. Median proportion of people seen via telehealth increased from 0% pre (IQR 0 to 1) to 60% during the pandemic (IQR 10 to 100). Most clinicians reported managing common musculoskeletal conditions via telehealth. Less than half (42%) of clinicians surveyed believed telehealth was as effective as face-to-face care. A quarter or less believed patients value telehealth to the same extent (25%), or that they have sufficient telehealth training (21%). Lack of physical contact when working through telehealth was perceived to hamper accurate and effective diagnosis and management. CONCLUSION: Although telehealth was adopted by allied health clinicians during the coronavirus pandemic, we identified barriers that may limit continued telehealth use among allied health clinicians beyond the current pandemic.","output":"Its not hands-on therapy, so its very limited: Telehealth use and views among allied health clinicians during the coronavirus pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although as many as 75% of the >2 million annual intensive care unit (ICU) survivors experience symptoms of psychological distress that persist for months to years, few therapies exist that target their symptoms and accommodate their unique needs.

LIFT reduced distress symptoms more than either a telephone-based mindfulness program or education control in a pilot randomized clinical trial (LIFT1). OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods of a factorial experimental clinical trial (LIFT2) being conducted to aid in the development and implementation of the version of the LIFT intervention that is optimized across domains of effect, feasibility, scalability, and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The LIFT2 study is an optimization trial conceptualized as a component of a larger multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) project. The goal of LIFT2 is to use a 2  2  2 factorial experimental trial involving 152 patients to determine the ideal components of the LIFT mobile mindfulness program for ICU survivors across factors including (1) study introduction by call from a therapist vs. app only, (2) response to persistent or worsening symptoms over time by therapist vs. app only, and (3) high dose vs. low dose. The primary trial outcome is change in depression symptoms 1 month from randomization measured by the PHQ-9 instrument. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical symptoms; measures of feasibility, acceptability, and usability; as well as themes assessed through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with study participants conducted after follow up completion.

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemic, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well-validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, emergency use authorization (EUA)-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity toward sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 prepandemic healthy donors was &#8805;99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at &#8805;16 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and &#8805;32 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients. Altogether, the Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Performance Characteristics of the Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG Serological Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Pulmonary Vascular Disease Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (CVOD-19) is presumed to be a prothrombotic state however, there is no concrete evidence supporting therapeutic anticoagulation in this disease Here, we present a case of a 67-year old male diagnosed with COVID-19 who developed an acute pulmonary embolism and right ventricular strain pattern during hospitalization and was treated with therapeutic Lovenox CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old male who had tested positive for COVID-19 one week ago presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, fever (T 102 8), and generalized body aches His oxygen saturation worsened, and he was put on the nasal cannula, later transitioning to non-rebreather, and finally intubation for not maintaining saturation Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest on admission revealed bilateral, bibasilar and sub-pleural ground-glass opacities (Figure 1) One week later, he became hypotensive, tachycardiac, and hypoxic on the same ventilator settings Bedside echocardiogram revealed right ventricular dilatation and akinesis of the mid free wall (Figure 2) A provisional diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made and he was treated with therapeutic Lovenox CT scan of the chest with contrast confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (Figure 3) His hospital course was complicated by pneumonia treated which was treated with antibiotics He was discharged to a nursing home with a tracheostomy tube and Eliquis on the third week of hospitalization DISCUSSION: Emerging as a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread across the world It attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed in the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract [1] Widespread microvascular thrombi in the pulmonary circulation as evidenced by autopsy studies cause profound hypoxia by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the lungs The proposed mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis includes hypercoagulable state and cytokine-mediated damage [2] It is believed that 50 % of these patients have elevated D-dimer levels that in combination with elevated prothrombin time and reduction in fibrinogen level have been associated with increased mortality [3] Some enterprises are therapeutically anticoagulating these patients based on these coagulation parameters while others are not CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 increases the incidence of microvascular and microvascular thrombotic complications Worsening respiratory status not explained by radiological changes in the lung fields, and especially in conjunction with high titers of D-dimers, should raise the suspicion for pulmonary embolism More studies are needed to evaluate the need for therapeutic anticoagulation in these patients without objective evidence of thrombosis Reference #1: Yang XL, Wang XG, Hu B, Zhang L, Zhang W, et al A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature 2020 https://doi org/10 1038/s41586-020-2012-7 Reference #2: Mei H , Hu Y (2020) Characteristics, causes, diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi 41:E002 Reference #3: ang N, Li D, Wang X, Sun Z Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2020 Apr 1 DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by John Madara, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Sohaib Roomi, source=Web Response","output":"Pulmonary Embolism and Right Heart Strain Pattern in Covid-19: an Incidental Finding or a Persistent Pattern?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or 'Coronavirus' has become a global pandemic since its initial report in Wuhan, China, on November 17, 2020.

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic. This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.

ICEES is equipped with tools to support basic statistical exploration of the integrated data in a completely open manner. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to further develop and apply ICEES as a novel tool for openly exposing and exploring integrated clinical and environmental data. We focus on an asthma use case. METHODS: We queried the ICEES open application programming interface (OpenAPI) using a functionality that supports chi-square tests between feature variables and a primary outcome measure, with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (=.001). We focused on 2 primary outcomes that are indicative of asthma exacerbations: annual emergency department (ED) or inpatient visits for respiratory issues; and annual prescriptions for prednisone. RESULTS: Of the 157,410 patients within the asthma cohort, 26,332 (16.73%) had 1 or more annual ED or inpatient visits for respiratory issues, and 17,056 (10.84%) had 1 or more annual prescriptions for prednisone. We found that close proximity to a major roadway or highway, exposure to high levels of particulate matter 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) or ozone, female sex, Caucasian race, low residential density, lack of health insurance, and low household income were significantly associated with asthma exacerbations (P<.001). Asthma exacerbations did not vary by rural versus urban residence. Moreover, the results were largely consistent across outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the open-source ICEES can be used to replicate and extend published findings on factors that influence asthma exacerbations. As a disease-agnostic, open-source approach for integrating, exposing, and exploring patient-level clinical and environmental exposures data, we believe that ICEES will have broad adoption by other institutions and application in environmental health and other biomedical fields.","output":"Development and Application of an Open Tool for Sharing and Analyzing Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Data: Asthma Use Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE.

It is characterized by the presence of abnormalities of vascular structures, and may affect many organ systems, including the lungs, brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. A causative mutation is identified in approximately 97% of patients with definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in one of three genes including a mutation in endoglin, a mutation in a locus mapped to chromosome 5, and an activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ACVRL1) mutation that is associated with an increased incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare (15-25 cases per million people) but severe vascular disorder. Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with several gene mutations, with 75% having a mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2). However, the remaining 25% of patients have other associated genetic mutations including ACVLR1, which is also associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare complication in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (< 1% of the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia population). We describe a case report with this rare occurrence. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old white/caucasian Irish male presented for screening for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia due to a history of recurrent epistaxis (once/week) and a family history suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic testing confirmed an ACVRL1 mutation, while an echocardiogram and right heart catheterization confirmed pulmonary arterial hypertension. On examination, he had several mucocutaneous telangiectasia across his face. He was commenced on tadalafil and macitentan. However, this led to increased iron deficiency anemia and pedal edema. Selexipag was also added to his drug regime. He continues to require intermittent admissions for diuresis and blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: The association of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension is rare (< 1%). Here we describe a case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia complicated with pulmonary arterial hypertension as a result of an ACVRL1 mutation. We also describe the clinical challenges of treating these two conditions together, as treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension tend to worsen hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia symptoms.","output":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia associated with ACVRL1 mutation: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EINLEITUNG: Als Reaktion auf die Corona-Pandemie fand im Frhjahr 2020 ein gesellschaftlicher Stillstand statt.

BACKGROUND: Extensive lockdown restrictions were implemented by the government to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic situation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether and how access to the emergency department (ED) changed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to baseline parameter in a hospital in the county Mecklenburg in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on patients who accessed the ED in \\"Corona - Phase 1\\" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) and \\"Corona - Phase 2\\" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020) were collected and compared with the\\"pre-Covid-era\\" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020). RESULTS: Data on 24,977 patients were evaluated; of these, 2493 patients in the Corona-Phase 1 and 5106 patients in the Corona-Phase 2 periods. Among these patients, 53% patients were older than 50, 30% older than 70 years. Normally 67.6 patients/day (p/d) visit the ED. This value decreased to 19.7 p/d in Phase 1 and 8.2 p/d in phase 2. 24% of the patients were referred by the GP, 56% presented themselves and 17% by the rescue service. Wo observed a decline of stroke cases by 52%, heart attacks by 61% and atrial fibrillation by 55% in Phase 1. The decline of cases mainly persisted in phase 2 (e. g. stroke 29%). CONCLUSIONS: Access to the ED decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak especially by patients who presented to the ED by themselves or referred by the GP - these were more than those brought into the ED by the rescue service. Based on literature and our own data, we suspect the lockdown restrictions could be responsible for the observed decrease of cases, too. In the context of the mild course of COVID-19 cases in Mecklenburg, these results are surprising.

Results: The average errors of 1-step to 10-step forecasting were 2.9%. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we evaluated the potential effects of a number of public health measures. We found that the estimated peak number of new cases and cumulative cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases worldwide with one week later additional intervention were reduced to 103,872, 2,104,800, and 2,271,648, respectively. The estimated total peak number of new cases and cumulative cases would be the same as the above and the maximum number of cumulative cases would be 3,864,872 in the world with 3 week later additional intervention. Duration time of the Covid-19 spread would be increased from 91 days to 123 days. Our estimation results showed that we were in the eve of stopping the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. However, we observed that transmission would quickly rebound if interventions were relaxed. Conclusions: The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. The AI and causal inference-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking.

However, the comparative effects of different expectation inductions, such as verbal suggestion or mental imagery, and their generic effects on physical sensitivity, to different sensations such as pain, itch, and fatigue, are still largely unknown. In the current study, we assessed the individual and combined effects of verbal suggestion and imagery on pain, itch, and fatigue as indicators of physical sensitivity in a randomized study design. Healthy participants (n = 116) were given an inert (placebo) capsule that was said to be effective for reducing physical sensitivity in either the majority (positive verbal suggestion) or the minority (control verbal suggestion) of users. Subsequently, they imagined either their best possible health (positive imagery) or a typical day (control imagery). Sensitivity to pain, itch, and fatigue was tested using a cold pressor test, histamine iontophoresis, and a bicycle test, respectively. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded continuously. Results showed that positive verbal suggestion and imagery successfully induced positive expectations, but they did not affect physical sensitivity, as indicated by sensitivity to pain, itch, or fatigue, or concurrent physiological responses.

After the transition, they used trapezius and deltoid to move the hand toward the toy and combinations of multiple muscles when their arms were high and extended near the toy. Thus, infants showed a dramatic change in which muscles worked together across the transition to reaching, even though their hands moved in similar spatial regions.","output":"Spatially Specific Changes in Infants' Muscle Coactivity as They Learn to Reach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly and this scenario is concerning worldwide. In hospitalized patients, dysnatremia (hyponatremia and/or hypernatremia) is the most common electrolyte disturbance, being reported in 30C40% of cases and associated with a poor prognosis. This retrospective longitudinal study aimed to evaluate the association of dysnatremia with mortality in hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. We analyzed data from hospital records of 1000 patients with COVID-19 (median age, 62.5 years;57.1% men), including 109 (10.9%) deaths. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models with Hazard Ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were applied to confirm the association between dysnatremia (hyponatremia and/or hypernatremia) and death. Hypernatremia was detected in 83 (76.1%) of the patients who died, with a cumulative reduction in survival ( p < 0.01) and an increased risk for death by 2.4 fold (95%CI 1.4C2.9). In the multivariable analysis, hypernatremia was the main factor associated with increased mortality (HR:1.50;95%CI:1.23C1.81). Other factors also associated with death were long length of stay (LOS) (HR:1.54;95%CI:1.21C1.78), old age (HR:1.63;95%CI:1.28C1.88), and kidney disease (HR:1.77;95%CI:1.21C3.30). Hypernatremia during hospitalization is an important risk factor for poor prognosis and an increased risk (2.4) of mortality.

Similar deals are evident around access to proposed vaccines for COVID-19, and such deals are only likely to increase. These attempts to secure preferential access to medicines and vaccines, so-called vaccine/treatment nationalism, jeopardise supplies of life-saving treatments and vaccines available elsewhere, and jeopardise global equitable distribution of such vaccines/treatments more generally. Much of the focus to date has been on States role in negotiating such deals. However, such developments also demonstrate the power patent holders have in controlling access to life-saving healthcare, determining who obtains access first and at what price. This article argues that the extent of control currently given to patent holders for COVID-19 must be questioned. This article demonstrates that patents have significant implications for healthcare acting as private governance tools over patented inventions.

Although the overall rate of PhACs extraction from hospital wastewater (HWW) through different secondary wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been high equal to 79C99%, activity and proliferation of neurotransmitters are inhibited by antiseptics due to the low removal rate of some elements, such as naproxen, excellent-performance technologies are still needed. Venlafaxine and citalopram are the most used antidepressants associated with 10C12% removal value through WWTPs. While HWW contains various types of antibiotics, they improve biocides bacterial tolerance against treatment. Ozonation is one of the methods to enhance biodegradability, whereas biofilm reactors have effectively removed emerging contaminants (ECs). Combined activate sludge (CAS) and membrane filtration bioreactors will potently exclude compounds, but previous studies show that membrane filtration bioreactors are around 30%-55% more efficient. ECs elimination in tertiary treatment has shown its great ability rather than conventional treatment sectors. Moreover, ozone treatment can decrease in PPCPs value as 90C98% through activated carbon beds. Activated carbon (NAC) has shown its full capability for micropollutants removal from PAC and membrane bioreactors as well as PPCP reside removal from treated effluents.

STUDY TYPE Cross-sectional multi-institutional survey. METHODS An online survey of 55 otolaryngology departments across North America. RESULTS As of March 25, 2020, almost all (n = 53 of 55, 96.3%) otolaryngology departments had canceled elective cases and were performing only urgent consults. Most residents continued to participate in operative cases (n = 45 of 49, 91.8%) and take call (n = 48 of 50, 96.0%). Of the respondents, 27 of 29 (93.1%) stated that they were deferring nonemergent tracheostomy procedures for the time being. The use of personal protective equipment followed a general trend of an increasing level of protection with an increased risk of the procedure; most (n = 49 of 54, 90.7%) incorporated N95 mask usage for bedside/clinic examinations with flexible laryngoscopy. Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces. DISCUSSION Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure. Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations. Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers.

HCPs across studies believed that vaccination is important to protect themselves and their patients. However, beliefs that some diseases such as influenza are less risky were reported by some HCPs as a reason for not getting vaccinated. Concerns about both short- and long-term side effects were identified among HCPs in most studies, such as those affecting the immune or neurological system. Mistrust toward health authorities and pharmaceutical industry was reported in some studies. The question of mandatory vaccination revealed mixed opinions, with some favoring self-determination and others viewing vaccination as a duty.

However, the systematic study of a catalyst structure and mechanism about Cu(III) with peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation is challenging owing to the coexistence of multiple Cu species and the structural symmetry of PDS. Herein, we anchored a Cu atom with two pyridinic N atoms to synthesize a single-atom Cu catalyst (CuSA-NC). Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations complemented each other well because of the uniform atomic active sites. The single-atom Cu was identified as the active site, and the unsaturated Cu-N2 configuration was more conductive to PDS activation than the saturated Cu-N4 configuration. Benefiting from the generation of Cu(III), CuSA-NC exhibited an obvious selective and anti-interference performance for pollutant degradation in a complex matrix. The superior catalytic activity of CuSA-NC compared with that of other reported Cu-based catalysts and good durability in a continuous-flow experiment further revealed the potential of CuSA-NC for practical applications. This work strongly deepens the understanding of the generation of Cu(III) in a single-atom Cu catalyst with unsaturated Cu-N2 sites under PDS activation and develops an efficient approach for actual water purification.","output":"Origin of the Excellent Activity and Selectivity of a Single-Atom Copper Catalyst with Unsaturated Cu-N2 Sites via Peroxydisulfate Activation: Cu(III) as a Dominant Oxidizing Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

Within a healthcare context, psychological safety supports patient safety by enabling engagement in quality improvement and encouraging staff to speak up about errors. Despite the low levels of psychological safety in healthcare teams and the important role it plays in supporting patient safety, there is a dearth of research on interventions that can be used to improve psychological safety or its related constructs. This review synthesises the content, theoretical underpinnings and outcomes of interventions which have targeted psychological safety, speaking up, and voice behaviour within a healthcare setting. It aims to identify successful interventions and inform the development of more effective interventions. METHODS: A key word search strategy was developed and used to search electronic databases (PsycINFO, ABI/Inform, Academic search complete and PubMed) and grey literature databases (OpenGrey, OCLC WorldCat, Espace). Covidence, an online specialised systematic review website, was used to screen records. Data extraction, quality appraisal and narrative synthesis were conducted on identified papers. RESULTS: Fourteen interventions were reviewed. These interventions fell into five categories. Educational interventions used simulation, video presentations, case studies and workshops while interventions which did not include an educational component used holistic facilitation, forum play and action research meetings. Mixed results were found for the efficacy or effectiveness of these interventions. While some interventions showed improvement in outcomes related to psychological safety, speaking up and voice, this was not consistently demonstrated across interventions. Included interventions' ability to demonstrate improvements in these outcomes were limited by a lack of objective outcome measures and the ability of educational interventions alone to change deeply rooted speaking up behaviours. CONCLUSION: To improve our understanding of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions targeting psychological safety, speaking up and voice behaviour, longitudinal and multifaceted interventions are needed. In order to understand whether these interventions are successful, more objective measures should be developed. It is recommended that future research involves end users in the design phase of interventions, target both group and organisational levels, ensure visible leader support and work across and within interdisciplinary teams.

We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery.

In the present investigation, we assess nasopharyngeal suctioning as a mitigation strategy to decrease particulate spread during simulated endonasal surgical activity. METHODS: Airborne particulate generation in the 1\\\\10m range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real\\\\time during cadaveric\\\\simulated anterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery conditions. To test suction mitigation, experiments were performed both with and without a rigid suction placed in the contralateral nostril, terminating in the nasopharynx. RESULTS: Both anterior (medial maxillary wall and nasal septum) and posterior (sphenoid rostrum) drilling produced significant particulate generation in the 1\\\\10m range throughout the duration of drilling (p<0.001) without the use of suction, while nasopharyngeal suction use eliminated the detection of generated airborne particulate. A similar effect was seen with nasal cautery, with significant particle generation (p<0.001) that was reduced to undetectable levels with the use of nasopharyngeal suction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of nasopharyngeal suctioning via the contralateral nostril minimizes airborne particulate spread during simulated sinonasal drilling and cautery.

AIMS: This study aims to compare the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with cancer (with and without COVID-19) and characterize the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID-19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be Non-Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID-19 living in lower-income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All-cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID-19.

The identification of disease at an early stage is needed to provide proper medication and isolate patients to preventing the spread of virus. This chapter focuses on the application of an artificial intelligenceCbased enhanced kernel support vector machine (E-KSVM) approach to detect COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). KSVM is enhanced by the use of the particle swarm optimization algorithm to tuning the parameters of KSVM. First, preprocessing takes place to remove unwanted details and noise. This is followed by the Hough transform to extract useful features from the image. Finally, the E-KSVM model is applied to classify images into normal, COVID-19, and ARDS. An extensive set of experimentations takes place on a chest X-ray dataset and ensures that the E-KSVM model has the ability to detect the disease effectively. The simulation outcome indicates that the E-KSVM model attains a maximum sensitivity of 72.34%, specificity of 75.20%, accuracy of 74.01%, and F score of 73.94% with a minimum computation time of 8.039s.","output":"Artificial intelligenceCbased solutions for early identification and classification of COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 hit the economy in an unprecedented way, changing the data generating process of many series.

However, there are no well-established methods for optimizing PEEP selection due to the heterogeneity of ARDS. This research investigates the viability of titrating PEEP to minimum elastance for mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. METHODS Ten mechanically ventilated ARDS patients from the Christchurch Hospital Intensive Care Unit were included in this study. Each patient underwent a stepwise PEEP recruitment manoeuvre. Airway pressure and flow data were recorded using a pneumotachometer. Patient-specific respiratory elastance (Ers ) and dynamic functional residual capacity (dFRC) at each PEEP level were calculated and compared. Optimal PEEP for each patient was identified by finding the minima of the PEEP-Ers profile. RESULTS Median Ers and dFRC over all patients and PEEP values were 32.2 cmH2O/l [interquartile range (IQR) 25.0-45.9] and 0.42 l [IQR 0.11-0.87]. These wide ranges reflect patient heterogeneity and variable response to PEEP. The level of PEEP associated with minimum Ers corresponds to a high change of functional residual capacity, representing the balance between recruitment and minimizing the risk of overdistension. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring patient-specific Ers can provide clinical insight to patient-specific condition and response to PEEP settings. The level of PEEP associated with minimum-Ers can be identified for each patient using a stepwise PEEP recruitment manoeuvre. This 'minimum elastance PEEP' may represent a patient-specific optimal setting during mechanical ventilation.

We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed COVID-19: mild/moderate (n=7) and severe (n=19). Immunophenotyping of whole blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n=25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. RESULTS: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between mild and severe patients. Increased counts of CD15 (+)CD16 (+) neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with the emergence of PDL1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. CONCLUSION: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages. COVID-19 alters the frequency and functional phenotypes of granulocyte subsets with the emergence of CRTH2 as a disease biomarker.","output":"A granulocytic signature identifies COVID-19 and its severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The detrimental role of viruses has been well described in CF, although the pattern of virus infections has not been investigated in a longitudinal study.

One of the important applications of robots to fight such infectious diseases is disinfection. Manual disinfection can be a time-consuming, risky, labor-intensive, and mundane, and humans may fail to disinfect critical areas due to the resulting fatigue. Autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile manipulators mounted with a spray nozzle at the end-effector can be very effective in spraying disinfectant liquid for deep disinfection of objects and surfaces. In this paper, we present an area-coverage planning algorithm to compute a path that the nozzle follows to disinfect surfaces represented by their point clouds. We project the point cloud on a plane and produce a polygon on which we generate multiple spray paths using our branch and bound-based tree search area-coverage algorithm such that the spray paths cover the entire area of the polygon. An appropriate spray path is chosen using a robot capability map-based selection criterion. We generate mobile manipulator trajectories using successive refinement-based parametric optimization so that the paths for the nozzle are followed accurately. Thereafter, we need to make sure that the joint velocities of the mobile manipulator are regulated appropriately such that each point on the surface receives enough disinfectant spray. To this end, we compute the time intervals between the robot path waypoints such that enough disinfectant liquid is sprayed on all points of the point cloud that results in thorough disinfection of the surface, and the particular robot path is executed in the minimum possible time. We have implemented the area-coverage planning and mobile manipulator motion planning on five test scenarios in simulation using our ADAMMS-SD (Agile Dexterous Autonomous Mobile Manipulation System for Surface Disinfection) robot. We benchmark our spray path generation algorithm with three competing methods by showing that the generated paths are significantly more efficient in terms of area coverage and reducing disinfectant wastage.

We aimed to investigate the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on general practice health-care usage, and the subsequent diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions in a deprived UK population. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected primary care data that was recorded in the Salford Integrated Record between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020. We extracted the weekly number of clinical codes entered into patient records overall, and for six high-level categories: symptoms and observations, diagnoses, prescriptions, operations and procedures, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures. Negative binomial regression models were applied to monthly counts of first diagnoses of common conditions (common mental health problems, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer), and corresponding first prescriptions of medications indicative of these conditions. We used these models to predict the expected numbers of first diagnoses and first prescriptions between March 1 and May 31, 2020, which were then compared with the observed numbers for the same time period. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 1073 first diagnoses of common mental health problems were reported compared with 2147 expected cases (95% CI 1821 to 2489) based on preceding years, representing a 500% reduction (95% CI 411 to 569). Compared with expected numbers, 456 fewer diagnoses of circulatory system diseases (433% reduction, 95% CI 296 to 535), and 135 fewer type 2 diabetes diagnoses (490% reduction, 238 to 631) were observed. The number of first prescriptions of associated medications was also lower than expected for the same time period. However, the gap between observed and expected cancer diagnoses (31 fewer; 160% reduction, -181 to 366) during this time period was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this deprived urban population, diagnoses of common conditions decreased substantially between March and May 2020, suggesting a large number of patients have undiagnosed conditions. A rebound in future workload could be imminent as COVID-19 restrictions ease and patients with undiagnosed conditions or delayed diagnosis present to primary and secondary health-care services. Such services should prioritise the diagnosis and treatment of these patients to mitigate potential indirect harms to protect public health.

Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. A total of 764 patients admitted to 14 different hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic from 03/09/2020 to 05/20/2020 who had reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction proven coronavirus infection were included. We used LightGBM, a machine learning algorithm, to predict in-hospital mortality at different time points (after 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days of hospitalization) and in-hospital LOS. Results: Among 764 patients, 116 (15%) either died (n = 87) or were transitioned to hospice care (n = 29) during their hospitalization. The median LOS was 5 days (range 1 - 44 days) for patients admitted to the regular nursing floor and 10 days (range 1-38 days) for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients who died during hospitalization were older, initially admitted to the ICU, more likely to be white and to have worse organ dysfunction compared to patients who survived their hospitalization.

Although the emotion of disgust has been shown to be an effective tool to affect consumer attitudes toward meat, it remains unclear whether such graphic warning labels that recruit disgust would also affect people's intentions to reduce their meat consumption. Two experiments reveal that graphic warning labels, by recruiting disgust, can increase people's intention to reduce their current levels of meat consumption. However, by eliciting disgust, graphic warning labels can simultaneously trigger reactance: graphic images can make people feel they are being manipulated, thereby ironically decreasing meat-reduction intentions. In a final experiment, we aimed to circumvent reactance by providing disgusting information under the guise of trivia, thereby avoiding the perception that the disgusting information was meant to manipulate. Via this route, disgust becomes a potent tool to influence consumers' intentions to consume meat.

However, there is lack of sustained improvement in 30 to 46% of infants. Aerosolized prostaglandins I2 (PGI2) and E1 (PGE1) have been reported to be effective selective pulmonary vasodilators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of inhaled PGE1 (IPGE1) in NHRF. METHODS Two pilot multicenter phase II RCTs are included in this report. In the first pilot, late preterm and term neonates with NHRF, who had an oxygenation index (OI) of 15 and <25 on two arterial blood gases and had not previously received INO, were randomly assigned to receive two doses of IPGE1 (300 and 150 ng/kg/min) or placebo. The primary outcome was the enrollment of 50 infants in six to nine months at 10 sites. The first pilot was halted after four months for failure to enroll a single infant. The most common cause for non-enrollment was prior initiation of INO. In a re-designed second pilot, co-administration of IPGE1 and INO was permitted. Infants with suboptimal response to INO received either aerosolized saline or IPGE1 at a low (150 ng/kg/min) or high dose (300 ng/kg/min) for a maximum duration of 72 hours. The primary outcome was the recruitment of an adequate number of patients (n = 50) in a nine-month-period, with fewer than 20% protocol violations. RESULTS No infants were enrolled in the first pilot. Seven patients were enrolled in the second pilot; three in the control, two in the low-dose IPGE1, and two in the high-dose IPGE1 groups. The study was halted for recruitment futility after approximately six months as enrollment targets were not met. No serious adverse events, one minor protocol deviation and one pharmacy protocol violation were reported. CONCLUSIONS These two pilot RCTs failed to recruit adequate eligible newborns with NHRF.

Complex challenges facing countries, such as COVID-19, cut across health, education, environment, financial and other sectors. Addressing these challenges requires the range of responsible sectors and intersecting services C across health, education, social and financial protection, economic development, law enforcement, among others C transform the way they work together towards shared goals. While the necessity of MSC is recognized, research is needed to understand how sectors collaborate, inform how to do so more efficiently, effectively and equitably, and ascertain similarities and differences across contexts. To answer these questions and inform practice, research to strengthen the evidence-base on MSC is critical. METHODS: This paper draws on a 12-country study series on MSC for health and sustainable development, in the context of the health and rights of women, children and adolescents. It is written by core members of the research coordination and country teams. Issues were analyzed during the study period through real-time discussions and structured reporting, as well as through literature reviews and retrospective feedback and analysis at the end of the study. RESULTS: We identify four considerations that are unique to MSC research which will be of interest to other researchers, in the context of COVID-19 and beyond: 1) use theoretical frameworks to frame research questions as relevant to all sectors and to facilitate theoretical generalizability and evolution; 2) specifically incorporate sectoral analysis into MSC research methods; 3) develop a core set of research questions, using mixed methods and contextual adaptations as needed, with agreement on criteria for research rigor; and 4) identify shared indicators of success and failure across sectors to assess MSCs. CONCLUSION: In responding to COVID-19 it is evident that effective MSC is an urgent priority. It enables partners from diverse sectors to effectively convene to do more together than alone. Our findings have practical relevance for achieving this objective and contribute to the growing literature on partnerships and collaboration.

The adaptive algorithm proposed is deterministic, uses two parameters known as neighborhood distance and minimum support threshold value for the risk profile, and can be very useful in predicting bad debts. It produces overlapped as well as non-overlapped clusters. This algorithm can detect the outliers with the help of an adaptive threshold value for the object's risk profile attribute. Objects with a moderately high or high value of risk profile attribute may emerge as outliers, and these outliers can be known as bad debts. The clusters generated are labeled as paid fully, not paid fully, and not paid. It can also generate clusters of different sizes. The proposed adaptive deterministic algorithm clusters the dataset without knowing the number of clusters. Many clusters are generated using this algorithm, but the parameter risk profile minimum threshold value prunes the clusters being formed.

METHODS: This study utilized health records from hospitals and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) covering 46% of the Danish population (n = 2,693,924). In a time\\\\trend study, we compared the number of psychiatric in\\\\patients, referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior in years prior to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic to levels during the first lockdown (March 11 C May 17, 2020), inter\\\\lockdown period (May 18 C December 15, 2020), and second lockdown (December 16, 2020 C February 28, 2021). RESULTS: During the pandemic, the rate of psychiatric in\\\\patients declined compared to pre\\\\pandemic levels (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94 C 0.96, p < 0.01), with the largest decrease of 19% observed three weeks into the first lockdown. Referrals to mental health services were not significantly different (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.92 C 1.10, p = 0.91) during the pandemic; neither was suicidal behavior among hospital contacts (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.94 C 1.14, p = 0.48) nor EMS contacts (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00 C 1.18, p = 0.06). Similar trends were observed across nearly all age groups, sexes, and types of mental disorders examined. In the age group <18, an increase in the rate of psychiatric in\\\\patients (RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07 C 1.15, p < 0.01) was observed during the pandemic; however, this did not exceed the pre\\\\pandemic, upwards trend in psychiatric hospitalizations in the age group <18 (p = 0.78). CONCLUSION: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has been associated with a decrease in psychiatric hospitalizations, while no significant change was observed in referrals to mental health services and suicidal behavior.

It causes unprecedented morbidity and shocked health systems and the supply chains in new epicenters such as Italy, Spain, and the USA, claiming thousands of lives. Meanwhile, the pandemic is reaching swiftly and silently to low-income countries where international media cover less. How likely health outcomes among the countries with different economies may differ during the pandemic has not been reported yet. Methodologically, we conducted an analysis of COVID-19 deaths comparing case fatality rate (CFR) among countries with different income categories, applying COVID-19 global data from the European Centre for Disease Control including 199 countries data as of 31 March 2020, in the early phase of the pandemic. We categorized countries into high-income countries (HIC), upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), and low-income countries (LIC) according to World Bank classification by income as of 2020. FINDING: Statistically, countries in different income groups are significantly different in terms of new cases identified in the last 2 weeks and the case fatality rate (MANOVA, P value < 0.001). New tests and detected case numbers shot up in HICs where CFR shot up in LMICs and LICs. The results of this analysis pointed out an important gap among countries with different economic status during the ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSION: In the HIC, contact tracing, testing capacity, and outbreak response, as well as clinical services, are strong. In the LICs, there is a low capacity of outbreak response which is reflected by the significantly lower number of diagnostic tests. Consequently, the reported number of COVID-19 cases in LICs may not reflect the actual burden of the pandemic. Without effective prevention, the pandemic can readily break into the weak health system and over-burden the hospitals and clinical services in poor countries. This finding is showing health inequality between the rich and the poor being amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing such a gap through the local governance and integrated global responses will not only prevent unprecedented deaths, but also preserve the momentum towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","output":"Health inequality among different economies during early phase of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Here, we discuss a chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient with large pericardial effusion who arrested secondary to tamponade and had an unintentional pericardial decompression secondary to cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) that subsequently saved his life. Methods: PRESENTATION 67 years old male, a case of CKD on maintenance hemodialysis (for last two years) but inadequately dialyzed over last two months after recent covid pneumonia was detected to have large pericardial effusion (red arrows) on echocardiography (Figure 1). He was planned for intensive heparin free dialysis in view of absence of frank clinical and echocardiographic findings of tamponade with close surveillance for pericardial effusion. 60 minutes into hemodialysis, patient developed dyspnea, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after three cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Echocardiography (echo) guided pericardiocentesis was planned based on clinical suspicion of tamponade. But, echocardiography revealed only mild pericardial effusion (Figure 1). Chest x ray showed new left pleural effusion. Pleurocentesis revealed hemorrhagic fluid. Subsequently done CT thorax showed multiple rib fractures. Patient was discharged on day eleven in stable condition with repeat chest X ray and echocardiography showing no further collection. Figure1: Panel A ( Pre CPR echo, Large pericardial effusion - red arrows), Panel B (Post CPR echo, minimal pericardial effusion) [Formula presented] Results: DISCUSSION Though cardiac tamponade is largely a clinical diagnosis, various other features like echocardiography aid in its diagnosis. Diagnosis of tamponade in CKD patient with pericardial effusion is difficult because of several reasons. All classical clinical features of tamponade like hypotension or elevated systemic pressures may not be manifested all the time in cases of tamponade. Our patient developed clinical signs of tamponade 60 minutes into dialysis session indicating that precipitation of tamponade was likely due to reduction in preload due to ultrafiltration (UF) during hemodialysis. Though, daily dialysis is the initial preferred treatment of choice for uremic pericardial effusions in CKD patients without clinical or echocardiographic signs of tamponade, there are case reports which support early pericardiocentesis as treatment of choice in all large pericardial effusions in CKD patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). In our case of large pericardial effusion, due to absence of frank clinical/ echocardiographic evidence of tamponade, we were prompted to go for aggressive dialysis treatment plan, but had tamponade during dialysis. CPR can cause inadvertent injury to surrounding structures, ribs, abdominal organs and vascular injury. In our case, CPR associated injury lead to unintentional pericardial decompression probably due to rib injury or due to high force generated during CPR coupled with high pericardial pressures which overcame the tensile strength of pericardium resulting in pericardial decompression. Findings of fractured ribs on CT scan post resuscitation in our case supports that high force and pressure were generated during CPR. Conclusions: This case report supports early pericardiocentesis as treatment of choice for large pericardial effusion in CKD patients on MHD. Also, care should be taken while dialyzing these patient as rapid UF can precipitate tamponade.

METHODS In this IRB-approved study, patients were selected from a maintained six-year database of consecutive patients who underwent both pretreatment MRI imaging with a probable or definitive imaging diagnosis of HCC (LI-RADS 4 or 5) and loco-regional treatment with RFA. An experienced radiologist manually segmented the hepatic nodules in MRI arterial and equilibrium phases to obtain the volume of interest (VOI) for extraction of 107 quantitative textural features, including shape and first- and second-order features. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between textural features and complete response. RESULTS The study consisted of 34 patients with 51 treated hepatic nodules. Sustained complete response was achieved by 6 patients (4 with single nodule and 2 with multiple nodules). Of the 107 features from the arterial and equilibrium phases, 20 (18%) and 25 (23%) achieved AUC >0.7, respectively. The three best performing features were found in the equilibrium phase: Dependence Non-Uniformity Normalized and Dependence Variance (both GLDM class, with AUC of 0.78 and 0.76, respectively) and Maximum Probability (GLCM class, AUC of 0.76). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrates that a radiomic analysis of pre-treatment MRI might be useful in identifying patients with HCC who are most likely to have a sustained complete response to RFA.

As personal contact is greatly reduced, they also create a shared informational landscape, allowing for a shared threat response. This is a difficult task, since truthfulness of content that leads to actionable knowledge is impossible to consistently validate. So, not only that curation of information is rarely congruent with pressing health issues, but digital spaces may also become fertile ground for misinformation and disinformation, contributing to the devastating effects of an infodemic. Digital intermediaries are useful exactly because their representation of reality is not a true construct, but a result of purposely curated information. However, they are active, dynamic epistemological agents with their own logic and aim. In dealing with a pandemic, we should reconsider the ways how our digital informational landscapes are created and sustained. This urges us to consider ethical governance of digital data curation and dissemination, alongside forms of control of the truthfulness and reach of its content. Some of the most fundamental issues in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the newly available vaccines are reliant on digital information and data sharing among experts, and the role of informing the general public.

Researchers used a wide range of spatial and statistical software to apply spatial analysis for the purpose of disease mapping, exposure mapping, and epidemiological modeling. Factors limiting the use of these spatial techniques were the unavailability and bias of COVID-19 dataalong with scarcity of fine-scaled demographic, environmental, and socio-economic datawhich restrained most of the researchers from exploring causal relationships of potential influencing factors of COVID-19.

Inspired by the ability, a circulated air curtain composed of end-to-end plane jets generated by a relay of air pillars is proposed to confine exhaled contaminants in this study. Furthermore, the optimization study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is conducted to explore cutting-off performance and find better design parameters under different conditions, i.e., human-curtain distance, enclosure shape, jet velocity from air pillar, and exhalation modes. The multidirectional blockage and vortex-like rotative transmission routes of exhaled airflow are observed when air curtain exists. Results indicate that contaminants are concentrated around the source. The average mole fraction of exhaled contaminants outside air curtain under different human-curtain distance decreases 4.3%C19.6% compared to mixing ventilation with same flux. Shortening the human-curtain distance can improve the performance of air curtain and may change the direction of exhaled airflow. Moreover, It has better performance when the enclosure shape is close to a circle. Higher jet velocity is better for improving the confinement performance, but the trend is not very obvious as velocity increases. For exhalation modes, it is more challenging to control exhaled contaminants for intense exhalation activity (such as coughing) in steady simulation, but results in transient simulation show better performance when coughing only once. These results can provide a reference for the subsequent design and improvement in applying air curtain in hospital wards or other places, especially during the period of flu outbreak.

This study aimed to investigate endoparasites of captive wildlife in Bangladesh. Perception and understanding of veterinarians regarding one health and zoonoses were also assessed. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 to August 2020. A total of 45 fecal samples from 18 different species of wild animals (i.e., 11 species of mammals: herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, six birds, and a single reptile species) were collected randomly. Parasitological assessments were done by modified formalin ether sedimentation technique and rechecked by Sheathers sugar floatation technique. Molecular identification of Spirometra spp. was conducted by amplifying the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) gene. Questionnaire surveys among 15 veterinarians and an in-depth interview (IDI) with a zoo officer were conducted. Results: Helminths (Spirometra sp., Capillaria sp., Ascaridia/Heterakis, opisthorchiid, strongyles, acuariid, hookworms, roundworms, and unidentified nematode larvae) and protozoa (coccidian oocyst) were identified, and the overall prevalence was 48.9% (22/45). The cox1 sequences (341 bp) of the Bangladesh-origin Spirometra species from lion showed 99.3C99.7% similarity to the reference sequences of Spirometra decipiens (GenBank No: KJ599679.1; MT122766).

Only 6.7% of veterinarians perceived confidence in diagnosing parasitic diseases and preventing antiparasiticidal resistance. Conclusions: In the present survey, we found a considerable prevalence of endoparasites in captive wildlife. For the first time, zoonotically important S. decipiens from lion was molecularly characterized in Bangladesh. Veterinarian training is required to improve parasite control knowledge and practice.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre prospective study in pregnancy based on a universal antenatal screening program for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Throughout Spain 45 hospitals tested all women at admission on delivery ward using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 since late March 2020. The cohort of positive mothers and the concurrent sample of negative mothers was followed up until 6-weeks post-partum. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric outcomes. Main outcome measures: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. RESULTS: Among 1009 screened pregnancies, 246 were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Compared to negative mothers (763 cases), SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the odds of preterm birth (34 vs 51, 13.8% vs 6.7%, aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.32C3.36, p = 0.002); iatrogenic preterm delivery was more frequent in infected women (4.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.001), while the occurrence of spontaneous preterm deliveries was statistically similar (6.1% vs 4.7%). An increased risk of premature rupture of membranes at term (39 vs 75, 15.8% vs 9.8%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11C2.57, p = 0.013) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (23 vs 18, 9.3% vs 2.4%, aOR 4.62, 95% CI 2.43C8.94, p < 0.001) was also observed in positive mothers.

METHOD The case notes for 11 patients with adult Hirschsprung's disease, treated operatively between January 1986 and December 2007, were reviewed and data on preoperative diagnosis, operative procedures and postoperative complications were retrieved. RESULTS Diagnosis was by open rectal biopsy in nine patients and by rectal suction biopsy in two patients. The time taken for preoperative bowel preparation ranged from 10 to 35 days, and colostomy was required in three patients to facilitate bowel cleansing. The Soave and Swenson procedures were used in six and five patients, respectively, leading to anastomotic stricture in one patient treated using the Soave procedure and to leakage in two patients treated using the Swenson procedure. All procedures took longer than 300 min, and 300-800 ml of blood or plasma was transfused.

The aims of this research were to: (1) explore the individual- and country-level determinants of intentions to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, and (2) examine worldwide variation in vaccination intentions. This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, involving 6697 respondents across 20 countries. Results showed that 72.9% of participants reported positive intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19, whereas 16.8% were undecided, and 10.3% reported they would not be vaccinated. At the individual level, prosociality was a significant positive predictor of vaccination intentions, whereas generic beliefs in conspiracy theories and religiosity were negative predictors. Country-level determinants, including cultural dimensions of individualism/collectivism and power distance, were not significant predictors of vaccination intentions. Altogether, this study identifies individual-level predictors that are common across multiple countries, provides further evidence on the importance of combating conspiracy theories, involving religious institutions in vaccination campaigns, and stimulating prosocial motives to encourage vaccine uptake.","output":"Intentions to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19: The Role of Prosociality and Conspiracy Beliefs across 20 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lignans are a class of chemicals formed by the combination of two molecules of phenylpropanoids with promising nutritional and pharmacological activities. Lignans glucosides, which are converted from aglycones catalyzed by uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs), have abundant bioactivities. In the present study, two UGTs from Isatis indigotica Fort., namely IiUGT71B5a and IiUGT71B5b, were characterized to catalyze the glycosylation of lignans with promiscuities toward various sugar acceptors and sugar donors, and pinoresinol was the preferred substrate. IiUGT71B5a was capable of efficiently producing both pinoresinol monoglycoside and diglycoside. However, IiUGT71B5b only produced monoglycoside, and exhibited considerably lower activity than IiUGT71B5a. Substrate screening indicated that ditetrahydrofuran is the essential structural characteristic for sugar acceptors. The transcription of IiUGT71B5s was highly consistent with the spatial distribution of pinoresinol glucosides, suggesting that IiUGT71B5s may play biological roles in the modification of pinoresinol in I. indigotica roots.

Emotional and social support are essential to help people to get through personal crises such as bereavement. In this study we characterize the social support owners obtain from their dogs, provide evidence of how widespread this social support is amongst dog-owners, and show how social support from dogs can increase during a crisis (using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example). We collected data from a representative population-based sample of Spanish dog-owners and found that most respondents said that their dogs helped them to get through tough times. They got comfort from physical contact with their dogs, shared activities with them and treated them as confidants in a similar way to friends and family. These are all key aspects of social support, and dogs offer the advantage of being more available than human sources of support. It would be expected that the support that dogs provide would be increased during a time of personal crisis and when we looked at data collected from a convenience sample of Spanish dog-owners during the COVID-19 confinement that is what we found; during the confinement owners engaged in more shared activities with their dogs, hugged them more often and turned to them more as a source of companionship and comfort (p < 0.0001 in all cases). However, although owners did confide more in their dogs (p < 0.0001), the effect was not as great as for other aspects of social support. We suspect that this is because people were able to use telecommunications such as video conferencing to maintain their human confidant relationships. Our findings indicate that dogs can substitute for humans as sources of some kinds of social support when conventional sources are unavailable. Our conclusion is that where a dog is present in a household, it should be regarded as an important resource for social support. This should be considered when designing clinical interventions and when public health decisions are being made.","output":"The Value of Companion Dogs as a Source of Social Support for Their Owners: Findings From a Pre-pandemic Representative Sample and a Convenience Sample Obtained During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR remains the gold standard to perform viral detection, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is already used to perform diagnosis of various infections.

Video games, which have been extensively employed in educational contexts to understand lexical development in foreign languages, foster both exposure to and the production of authentic and meaning-focused vocabulary. An empirical study was conducted to explore the effect of playing an online multiplayer social deduction game (i.e., a game in which players attempt to uncover each others hidden role) on incidental and intentional second language (L2) vocabulary learning. Secondary school pre-intermediate English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students (n = 54) took a vocabulary pre-test that identified eight unknown words likely to appear in the video game Among Us. Then, students were randomly assigned to different groups of players and to different learning conditionswithin each group, half of the players were given a list of phrases containing such target words, which they were encouraged to meaningfully use in the game by means of written interaction. In doing so, students learnt some target words intentionally and provided contextualized incidental exposure to other players. They took a vocabulary test after two sessions of practice with the game to explore intentional and incidental L2 vocabulary learning gains. The pre- and post-tests suggested, among other results, that players using new L2 words in the game Among Us would retain more vocabulary than players only encountering them, that vocabulary intentionally input helped other users trigger incidental vocabulary learning, and that repetition had a positive effect on L2 vocabulary learning.","output":"The Effect of Multiplayer Video Games on Incidental and Intentional L2 Vocabulary Learning: The Case of Among Us"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although advance care planning (ACP) is beneficial if dementia develops, and virtually all older adults are at risk for this disease, older adults do not consistently engage in ACP. Health behavior models have highlighted the importance of perceived susceptibility to medical conditions in motivating behavior. Following these models, we sought to determine how often older adults believe they are not at risk of developing dementia and to examine the association between perceived dementia risk and ACP participation. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling adults without cognitive impairment, aged 65 years, who were interviewed for the Health and Retirement Study in 2016 and asked about their perceived dementia risk (n = 711). Perceived dementia risk was ascertained with this question: \\"on a scale of 0 to 100, what is the percent chance that you will develop dementia sometime in the future?\\" We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression to evaluate the association between perceived risk (0% versus >0%) and completion of a living will, appointment of a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions, and discussion of treatment preferences. RESULTS Among respondents, 10.5% reported a perceived dementia risk of 0%. Perceived risk of 0% was associated with lower odds of completing a living will (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93) and discussing treatment preferences (OR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.93) but not appointment of a durable power of attorney (OR 0.77; 95% CI, 0.42-1.39). Many respondents with perceived dementia risk >0% had not completed ACP activities, including a substantial minority of those with perceived risk >50%. CONCLUSIONS Older adults with no perceived dementia risk are less likely to participate in several forms of ACP, but the fact that many older adults with high levels of perceived risk had not completed ACP activities suggests that efforts beyond raising risk awareness are needed to increase engagement.","output":"Perceived dementia risk and advance care planning among older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive procedures are gaining widespread acceptance in difficult-to-access brain tumor treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the preferred choice, however, laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has emerged as a tumor cytoreduction technique. The present meta-analysis compared current SRS therapy with LITT in brain tumors. METHODS: A search was performed in Lilacs, PubMed, and Cochrane database. Patients demographics, tumor location, therapy used, Karnofsky performance status score before treatment, and patients outcome (median overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events) data were extracted from studies. The risk of bias was assessed by Cochrane collaboration tool. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in this meta-analysis. LITT and SRS MOS in brain metastasis patients were 12.8 months versus 9.8 months (ranges 9.3C16.3 and 8.3C9.8; P = 0.02), respectively. In a combined comparison of adverse effects among LITT versus SRS in brain metastasis, we found 15% reduction in absolute risk difference (?0.16; 95% confidence interval P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We could not state that LITT treatment is an optimal alternative therapy for difficult-to-access brain tumors due to the lack of systematic data that were reported in our pooled studies. However, our results identified a positive effect in lowering the absolute risk of adverse events compared with SRS therapy. Therefore, randomized trials are encouraged to ascertain LITT role, as upfront or postoperative/post-SRS therapy for brain tumor treatment.","output":"Laser interstitial thermal therapy as an adjunct therapy in brain tumors: A meta-analysis and comparison with stereotactic radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-scale deployment of COVID-19 vaccines will seriously affect the ongoing phases 2 and 3 randomised placebo-controlled trials assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.

Regrettably, only a small proportion of the population in many low-income and middle-income countries will have access to available vaccines.

Once sufficient knowledge on the immunogenicity response to COVID-19 vaccines is acquired, non-inferiority immunogenicity trials-comparing the immune response of a vaccine candidate to that of an authorised vaccine-would probably be the most common trial design. Until then, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trials will continue to play a role in the development of new vaccine candidates.

Previously developed prediction models may assist in triaging patients when allocating healthcare resources. We aimed to assess the value of several prediction models when applied to COVID-19 patients in the ED. Methods: All consecutive COVID-19 patients who visited the ED of a combined secondary/tertiary care center were included. Prediction models were selected based on their feasibility. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcomes were 14-day mortality, and a composite outcome of 30-day mortality and admission to the medium care unit (MCU) or the intensive care unit (ICU). The discriminatory performance of the prediction models was assessed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 403 ED patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Within 30 days, 95 patients died (23.6%), 14-day mortality was 19.1%. Forty-eight patients (11.9%) were admitted to the MCU, 66 patients (16.4%) to the ICU and 152 patients (37.7%) met the composite endpoint. Eleven models were included: RISE UP score, 4C mortality score, CURB-65, MEWS, REMS, abbMEDS, SOFA, APACHE II, CALL score, ACP index and Host risk factor score. The RISE UP score and 4C mortality score showed a very good discriminatory performance for 30-day mortality (AUC 0.83 and 0.84 respectively, 95% CI 0.79-0.88 for both), for 14-day mortality (AUC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79-0.88, for both) and for the composite outcome (AUC 0.79 and 0.77 respectively, 95% CI 0.75-0.84). The discriminatory performance of the RISE UP score and 4C mortality score was significantly higher compared to that of the other models. Conclusion: The RISE UP score and 4C mortality score have good discriminatory performance in predicting adverse outcome in ED patients with COVID-19.

Cancer incidence and/or death depends on several intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., dietary habits, socio-behavioral activities, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, gender, races/ethnicities and age). Various studies have found that an inverse relationship subsists between environmental temperature and cancer risk. Furthermore, this negative relationship was found to be more consistent in the USA female population. This research mainly focuses on influence of aging on cold environment mediated cancer risk for overall and various anatomical site-specific cancers. Age-specific county-wise data of cancer incidence rate (CIR) in the USA female population was selected in this study. Statistical analysis found a negative correlation between the average annual temperature (AAT) and CIR in all anatomical sites (AAS; overall) as well as different anatomical site-specific cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, leukaemia, pancreas, bladder, uterus, thyroid and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), except for cervical cancer) in different age groups (e.g., less than 50 years, 50 plus years, less than 65 years and 65 plus years). In addition, an inverse relationship between the AAT and CIR was found in case of paediatric cancer. However, all the results obtained from the linear model based statistical analysis proposed that the older age-group of females particularly above 65 years seems to be more prone to cold temperature linked cancer risk. For example, age-specific cold linked cancer incidence appears to be more inclined in case of breast cancer in the age-group of 65 plus years.

This study aims to explore through the literature the potential to design effective digital services that work for victims, survivors and those who provide domestic abuse support services. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a systems or service design thinking methodology which was adopted during a Scottish Government-funded Technology Enabled Care (TEC) pathfinder project on domestic abuse. This methodology is the basis for the Scottish Approach to Service Design which is based on the Design Council Double Diamond. During the first phase, known as the discovery phase, desk-based research is conducted by the service design team to inform their approach to the later phases (the second half of the first diamond is define whilst design and deliver form the second diamond). Time is spent during discovery to unpack the complexity whilst the approach takes a pragmatic worldview. Findings Technology has yet to be shown to provide an effective solution to any aspect of the victim or survivors' experience or support services albeit these are often over-stretched and under-funded even without the Covid-19 pandemic. Digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Digital developments should be grounded on ethical design principles. Research limitations/implications This study is the result of the desk-based research during a TEC project considering the potential role of technology in tackling domestic abuse. Limitations include only including evidence from the literature;interviews were conducted but are not reported here. Another limitation is the pragmatic rather than academic nature of the approach;it was to be a foundation for service re-design. So hopefully useful for new practitioners to immerse themselves in the topic area but with no claims to be reproducible as would be the case in a formal review. Practical implications All the evidence shows the authors need to keep trying different approaches, different forms of engagement and ways to empower survivors. Could technology support health-care practitioners to consistently use sensitive routine enquiry? Perhaps enable independent domestic violence advisors to attend more multidisciplinary team meetings in local community settings? Meanwhile, digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Technology has not yet provided a digital solution which is practical and meets the needs of the broad intersectional population affected by domestic abuse nor those who provide support. If the future is to be based on digital developments it must be grounded on ethical design principles.

limited. The present study aimed at analyzing the association between the psychophysical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and same-sex couples conflict, also considering the potential mediating effect of internalized sexual stigma (ISS). For this purpose, psychophysical challenges and couples conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic, ISS, age, biological sex, sexual orientation, relationship duration, religiosity, involvement in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) associations, sexual satisfaction, and interpersonal partner violence were assessed in an Italian sample of 232 LGB people engaged in a same-sex relationship (aged 18C45 years; M(age) = 28.68, SD = 6.91). The results indicated that the psychophysical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with couples conflict, and ISS mediated this relationship. Among the covariates considered, only sexual satisfaction was associated with couples conflict. The findings suggest that ISS, over and above the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychophysical health, triggered conflict within same-sex relationships. Studying the role of ISS in various relational and social contexts is important, as ISS may have an adverse effect on the mental health of sexual minority people. We recommend that more efforts be made to improve research on the LGB population during the public health response to the COVID-19 emergency, because the paucity of studies underlines the invisibility of this population in many domains, including the domain of romantic relationships.

This creates an additional challenge in medical waste management, particularly in developing countries. Improper managing of medical waste may have serious public health issues and a significant impact on the environment. There are currently three disinfection technologies, namely incineration, chemical, and physical, that are available to treat COVID-19 medical waste (CMW). This study focuses on thermochemical process, particularly the pyrolysis process to treat medical waste. Pyrolysis is a process that utilizes the instability of organic components in medical waste to convert it into valuable products. Besides, the technique is environmentally friendly, more efficient, requires less landfill capacity, causes lower pollution, and cost-effective. The current pandemic situation generates a high amount of plastic medical waste, which has components like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and nylon (N). These plastic wastes can be converted into valuable energy products like oil, gas and char through the pyrolysis process.

The molecular chaperones, the important mediator in the proteostasis network can be considered as any protein that contributes to proper folding and assembly of other macromolecules, through maturating of unfolded or partially folded macromolecules, refolding of stress-denatured proteins, and modifying oligomeric assembly, otherwise it leads to their proteolytic degradation. Viruses that use the hosts gene expression tools and protein synthesis apparatus to survive and replicate, are obviously protected by such a host chaperone system. This means that many viruses use members of the hosts chaperoning system to infect the target cells, replicate, and spread. During viral infection, increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to high expression of viral proteins enhances the level of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and induces cell apoptosis or necrosis. Indeed, evidence suggests that ER stress and the induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) may be a major aspect of the corona-host virus interaction. In addition, several clinical reports have confirmed the autoimmune phenomena in COVID-19-patients, and a strong association between this autoimmunity and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and S protein were detected by ELISA. A series of blood samples were collected along the disease course from the same patient, including 11 ICU patients and 27 non-ICU patients for longitudinal analysis. N and S specific IgM and IgG (N-IgM, N-IgG, S-IgM, S-IgG) in non-ICU patients increased after symptom onset. N-IgM and S-IgM in some non-ICU patients reached a peak in the second week, while N-IgG and S-IgG continued to increase in the third week. The combined detection of N and S specific IgM and IgG could identify up to 75% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the first week. S-IgG was significantly higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients in the third week. In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to iteratively devise protocols and processes that minimized HCW exposure while safely and effectively caring for children who may require unanticipated aerosol-generating procedures. METHODS As part of our PED's initiative to optimize clinical care and HCW safety during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, regular multidisciplinary systems and process simulation sessions were conducted. These sessions allowed us to evaluate and reorganize patient flow, test and improve communication modalities, alter the process for consultation in resuscitations, and teach and reinforce the appropriate donning and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS Simulation was a highly effective method to disseminate new practices to PED staff. Numerous workflow modifications were implemented as a result of our in situ systems and process simulations. Total number of persons in the resuscitation room was minimized, use of a \\"command post\\" with remote providers was initiated, communication devices and strategies were trialed and adopted, and personal protective equipment standards that optimized HCW safety and communication were enacted.

However, it remains unclear how neutrophils contribute to pathophysiology during COVID\\\\19. Here, we assessed the impact of the dysregulated cytokine profile on the regulated cell death (RCD) programme of neutrophils. METHODS: Regulated cell death phenotype of neutrophils isolated from critically ill COVID\\\\19 patients or healthy donors and stimulated with COVID\\\\19 or healthy plasma ex vivo was assessed by flow cytometry, time\\\\lapse microscopy and cytokine multiplex analysis. Immunohistochemistry of COVID\\\\19 patients and control biopsies were performed to assess the in situ neutrophil RCD phenotype. Plasma cytokine levels of COVID\\\\19 patients and healthy donors were measured by multiplex analysis. Clinical parameters were correlated to cytokine levels of COVID\\\\19 patients. RESULTS: COVID\\\\19 plasma induced a necroptosis\\\\sensitive neutrophil phenotype, characterised by cell lysis, elevated release of damage\\\\associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), increased receptor\\\\interacting serine/threonine\\\\protein kinase (RIPK) 1 levels and mixed lineage kinase domain\\\\like pseudokinase (MLKL) involvement. The occurrence of neutrophil necroptosis MLKL axis was further confirmed in COVID\\\\19 thrombus and lung biopsies.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of non-enhanced computer tomographic scans has been performed in the main center for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Blinded for those scanned from 13(th) of March 2020 to 13(th) of May 2020. Included scans were routinely performed during 24 -hs of admission apart from having respiratory complaint. CT protocol included non-enhanced 1 mm slice thickness by Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands). All computer tomographic scans were reviewed by two senior radiologists with more than 8 years of experience each and senior registrar. Several factors have been thoroughly studied including patient age, gender, positive versus negative pulmonary findings, laterality of lung involvement, lobar distribution, pattern of pulmonary changes on initial and follow-up scans. RESULTS: The total number of patients evaluated was 302. There were 188 men and 114 women studied. Among the totally studied 302 cases; 181 cases (59.9%) showed no pulmonary changes. Positive findings were present in 121 patients with a total number of 191 computer tomographic scans including initial and follow-up scans. Positive findings were present in 51 female and 70 male patients (age range, 12 - 87 years; mean age  standard deviation, 46.1  16.5). Bilateral disease was more frequently encountered presented in 86 cases (71.1%), while unilateral disease showed two times more predilection for the right lung compared to the left. The incidence of lobar involvement in descending order: right lower (75.2%), left lower (71.9%), right upper (62.8%), left upper (60.3%) and right middle (50.4%). The incidence of the affected lobes on the initial scans were as follow: one (24 %), two (10.7 %), three (9.1 %), four (16.5 %) five (36.4 %). In cases with single lobar involvement (24%); the left upper and right middle lobes showed lowest incidence of involvement accounting for 10.3 % & 13.8 %, respectively; on the other hand, in cases with four lobar involvement (16.5%); the right middle lobe was most commonly spared in two third of cases (63.2 %). Several initial patterns of the pulmonary changes resulting from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were present with a descending order; ground-glass pattern (96.7%), lenticular pattern (32.2%), Halo sign (15.7% %), rounded (14.9 %), nodular (10.7%), ground-glass with consolidation (8.3%), tree-in-bud (1.7 %) and pleural effusion (1.7 %). Pathologically-enlarged lymph node was not a feature of COVID-19. The total number of patients with positive findings having follow-up scans was 57 including single (45 patients) versus two (12 patients) follow-up scans. Initial follow up scans showed regression and progression of the pulmonary changes in 35 and 22 patients, respectively. A remarkable pattern was seen in almost all regressed cases that showed patchy reticular pattern changes with septal thickening which was referred to pulmonary synapses (34 patients) with only one patient showed complete resolution of the parenchymal changes. Patterns seen in progressed cases were lenticular ground-glass (63.6%) vs patchy ground-glass (36.4 %) patterns. CONCLUSION: Computer tomographic scan of the chest is a principal diagnostic measure for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pulmonary changes showed more propensity being bilateral disease and affecting the lower lobes, while the right middle lobe was the least likely involvement. Several pattern of pulmonary changes can be seen on initial scans including ground glass, consolidation, Halo sign, lenticular, nodular, pleural effusion and tree-in-bud patterns. The tree-in-bud is first time described pattern of COVID-19 in the current article and thought to be an excluding criterion. In follow-up scans; the lenticular and patchy ground-glass patterns were present in cases with disease progression, compared with pulmonary synapses pattern encountered in cases with disease regression.","output":"Chest CT Scan Features from 302 patients with COVID-19 in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Under the growing concern about prescription opioid misuse, abuse, addiction, tampering and diversion, stakeholders (e.g, governments, pharmaceutical companies and health care providers) are developing opioid formulations that they hope are less attractive to those seeking to misuse or abuse pain medications. However, these products must maintain their therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Many abusers tamper with formulations in an effort to convert the active ingredient into a form suitable for alternative and more abuse-desirable routes of administration, such as snorting, inhaling or injecting. AREAS COVERED A tamper-deterrent strategy is to embed opioid antagonists into the opioid agonist formulation. Upon tampering, the opioid antagonist is released and binds to the opioid receptors in sufficient amount to impede access of the agonist. This approach is intended to reduce the opioid subjective rewarding effects such as euphoria which are prominent following swallowing the dosage form without tampering. Sequestered naltrexone in sustained-release morphine or oxycodone is an example of this. We performed a comprehensive literature search using available databases to identify clinical studies utilizing an opioid agonist in combination with naltrexone. Efficacy, safety and abuse potential studies were identified for the developed products containing morphine and naltrexone as well as oxycodone and naltrexone. EXPERT OPINION The clinical impact of such combined formulations on tampering for abuse/misuse potential has not yet been determined, but long-term epidemiological studies are currently being conducted in order to answer these questions. Until these studies are complete, it seems prudent to remain cautious and assume that all formulations of prescription opioids might be abusable and that, similar to other opioids, the best current practice is to adhere to the principles of opioid risk management.","output":"Sequestered naltrexone in sustained release morphine or oxycodone - a way to inhibit illicit use?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trainees' value as effective leaders within academic medicine has been increasingly recognized.

Healthcare workers themselves, therefore, must be confident in vaccination as a public health good and able to transmit this confidence to those who trust them. However, just as with the general public, healthcare workers develop confidence at different rates and may be susceptible to misinformation about vaccines. METHODS: During April and May 2021, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted a mixed-methods survey to assess vaccination attitudes, opinions, and reasoning of 1197 healthcare workers across 14 Caribbean countries. FINDINGS: Seventy-seven percent of respondents expressed clear intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 as soon as possible. Intention to be vaccinated as soon as possible was expressed by lower proportions of nurses (66%) and allied health professionals (62%) than physicians (85%) and by younger respondents than older ones (64% vs. 85%, respectively; p < 0.001 for all these comparisons). Across 32 questions about attitudes and opinions, vaccine hesitancy was consistently expressed by higher proportions of nurses and allied health professionals than physicians and by younger respondents than older ones.

Our purpose was to report outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients after hospitalization in a field intensive care unit (ICU), established under military tents in a civilCmilitary collaboration. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to the Military Health Service Field Intensive Care Unit in Mulhouse (France) between March 24, 2020, and May 7, 2020, were included in the study. Medical history and clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively. The institutional review board of the French Society Anesthesia and Intensive Care approved the study. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were hospitalized (37 men, median age 62 [54-67] years, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 7 [6-10] points, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score 39 [28-50] points) during the 45-day deployment of the field ICU. Median length of stay was 11 [6-15] days and median length of ventilation was 13 [7.5-21] days. At the end of the deployment, 25 (53%) patients went back home, 17 (37%) were still hospitalized, and 4 (9%) died. At hospital discharge, 40 (85%) patients were alive. CONCLUSION: In this study, a military field ICU joined a regional civil hospital to manage a large cluster of COVID-19-related ARDS patients in Mulhouse, France. This report illustrates how military teams can support civil authorities in the provision of advanced critical care.

Early laparoscopic appendicectomy is the gold-standard management. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) brought concerns of increased perioperative mortality and spread of infection during aerosol generating procedures: as a consequence, conservative management was advised, and open appendicectomy recommended when surgery was unavoidable. This study describes the impact of the first weeks of the pandemic on the management of AA in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Patients 18 years or older, diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically with AA were eligible for inclusion in this prospective, multicentre cohort study. Data was collected from 23rd March 2020 (beginning of the UK Government lockdown) to 1st May 2020 and included: patient demographics, COVID status; initial management (operative and conservative); length of stay; and 30-day complications. Analysis was performed on the first 500 cases with 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: The patient cohort consisted of 500 patients from 48 sites. The median age of this cohort was 35 [26-49.75] years and 233 (47%) of patients were female. Two hundred and seventy-one (54%) patients were initially treated conservatively; with only 26 (10%) cases progressing to an operation. Operative interventions were performed laparoscopically in 44% (93/211). Median length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the conservatively managed group (2 [IQR 1-4] days vs. 3 [2-4], p < 0.001). At 30 days, complications were significantly higher in the operative group (p < 0.001), with no deaths in any group. Of the 159 (32%) patients tested for COVID-19 on admission, only 6 (4%) were positive. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has changed the management of acute appendicitis in the UK, with non-operative management shown to be safe and effective in the short-term.

Adults who had received two doses of CoronaVac in the past 3C6 months were vaccinated with Convidecia (n = 96) or CoronaVac (n = 102). Adults who had received one dose of CoronaVac in the past 1C3 months were also vaccinated with Convidecia (n = 51) or CoronaVac (n = 50). The co-primary endpoints were the occurrence of adverse reactions within 28 d after vaccination and geometric mean titers (GMTs) of neutralizing antibodies against live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus at 14 d after booster vaccination. Adverse reactions after vaccination were significantly more frequent in Convidecia recipients but were generally mild to moderate in all treatment groups. Heterologous boosting with Convidecia elicited significantly increased GMTs of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 than homologous boosting with CoronaVac in participants who had previously received one or two doses of CoronaVac.

An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from individuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mice infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. Our study serves as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.","output":"Baseline T cell immune phenotypes predict virologic and disease control upon SARS-CoV infection in Collaborative Cross mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A male patient with flu-like symptoms and tomography and laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

We recruited drug-na?ve or metformin-treated T2D patients with NAFLD to conduct a multicenter, prospective, open-label, exploratory clinical trial. Transient liver elastography (Fibroscan(?); Echosens, Paris, France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to non-invasively quantify hepatic fat contents. Fifty patients with CAP values above 250 dB/m were treated once daily with 0.5 mg lobeglitazone for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a decline in CAP values, and secondary endpoints included changes in components of glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles. Lobeglitazone-treated patients showed significantly decreased CAP values (313.4 dB/m at baseline vs. 297.8 dB/m at 24 weeks; P = 0.016), regardless of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone improved HbA(1C) values (7.41% [57.5 mM] vs. 6.56% [48.2 mM]; P < 0.001), as well as the lipid and liver profiles of the treated patients. Moreover, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline values of CAP, liver stiffness, and liver enzymes, and metformin use.

METHODS: Two paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results were stratified on the basis of gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold. RESULTS: Out of the 512 participants, aged 0-90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-min nasal swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swab had 97.5% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity, within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity.

As heightened inflammatory response is a key feature of both SARS-CoV infection and lung cancer and given the intriguing commonalities between the two, we analysed the RNA sequence dataset from lung cancer patients to get a better understanding of the critical regulators of inflammation in SAR-COV2. Methods: : The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets of lung cancer were analyzed for correlations between ACE2, Bradykinin, and other genes associated with inflammatory responses.

Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO 2. 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff &#8805;15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. RESULTS: Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -&#8734; to 14.9).

METHODS: Twelve skilled male hockey players (22.6 [3.4] years, 178.9 [4.7] cm, 84.0 [6.5] kg) played three 20-min regulation periods and one 12-min OT period of small-sided 3-on-3 scrimmage. Skaters repeated 2 min shift and rest intervals. Participants mouth rinsed with 25 mL of CHO or PLA solution approximately every 10 min for a total of 7 rinses. A local positioning system (LPS) tracked external load variables including speed, distance, acceleration, and deceleration. Internal load was monitored with heart rate (HR) sensors and a rating of perceived exertion (RPE). RESULTS: During regulation play, both the conditions developed similar fatigue, with significantly decreased high-intensity distance, average speed and decelerations, and increased RPE, from period 1 to 2 and 3. In OT, CHO MR increased the distance skated at high-intensity (224 [77], 185 [66] m, p = 0.042), peak speed (24.6 [1.6], 23.7 [1.3] kmh(?1), p = 0.016), number of sprints (1.9 [1.2], 1.2 [0.9], p = 0.011), and decreased distance skated at slow speed (300 [33], 336 [47], p = 0.034) vs. PLA MR. OT RPE was similar between the two conditions in spite of more work done in CHO MR. CONCLUSIONS: CHO MR may be a valuable practice to protect against decrements in external load with increased playing time in ice hockey, and possibly allows athletes to perform more work relative to perceived levels of exertion.","output":"Carbohydrate Mouth-Rinsing Improves Overtime Physical Performance in Male Ice Hockey Players During On-Ice Scrimmages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Seven dioxaborole compounds are investigated in this study.

In particular, disproportionate use of antibiotics, high ICU burden and longer in-hospital stays during the pandemic have been proposed to aggravate the emergency posed by carbapenem-resistant isolates (CRI), specially through carbapenemase production. However, there have been few reports worldwide regarding changes in CRI incidence and little latinamerican literature. ObjectiveWe set out to determine whether the incidence of CRI rose in a tertiary care center in Santa Fe, Argentina during the time period with active cases of COVID-19. MethodsAnalytic epidemiologic study retrospectively designed. Two time periods were defined: P1 (without active cases of COVID-19) from September, 2019 to August, 2020 and P2 (starting at the onset of the first wave of COVID-19 in this institution) from September, 2020 to June 2021. All clinically-relevant microbiological samples -those meant for diagnostic purposes-taken during the study period from patients in the Internal Medicine and Surgical wards as well as the Intensive Care Units were included. Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of CRI during each time frame by the count of patient-day during that same period, multiplied by a hundred. Results9,135 hospitalizations, 50,145 patient-days of analysis. A total of 7285 clinical samples were taken, with an overall positivity for CRI of 12.1% (n=883).

This measurement, however, is time consuming when done manually and unreliable through visual assessment. Moreover, its continuous monitoring requires the use of expensive devices. Capstesia? is a novel Android?/iOS? application, which calculates PPV from a digital picture of the arterial pressure waveform obtained from any monitor. The application identifies the peaks and troughs of the arterial curve, determines maximum and minimum pulse pressures, and computes PPV. In this study, we compared the accuracy of PPV generated with the smartphone application Capstesia (PPVapp) against the reference method that is the manual determination of PPV (PPVman). METHODS The Capstesia application was loaded onto a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. A physiologic simulator including PPV was used to display arterial waveforms on a computer screen. Data were obtained with different sweep speeds (6 and 12 mm/s) and randomly generated PPV values (from 2% to 24%), pulse pressure (30, 45, and 60 mm Hg), heart rates (60-80 bpm), and respiratory rates (10-15 breaths/min) on the simulator. Each metric was recorded 5 times at an arterial height scale X1 (PPV5appX1) and 5 times at an arterial height scale X3 (PPV5appX3). Reproducibility of PPVapp and PPVman was determined from the 5 pictures of the same hemodynamic profile. The effect of sweep speed, arterial waveform scale (X1 or X3), and number of images captured was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. The measurement error (ME) was calculated for each pair of data. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the ability of PPVapp to discriminate a PPVman > 13%. RESULTS Four hundred eight pairs of PPVapp and PPVman were analyzed. The reproducibility of PPVapp and PPVman was 10% (interquartile range, 7%-14%) and 6% (interquartile range, 3%-10%), respectively, allowing a threshold ME of 12%. The overall mean bias for PPVappX1 was 1.1% within limits of -1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.7 to -1.1) to +3.5% (95% CI, +3.2 to +3.8). Averaging 5 values of PPVappX1 with a sweep speed of 12 mm/s resulted in the smallest bias (+0.6%) and the best limits of agreement (1.3%). ME of PPVapp was <12% whenever 3, 4, or 5 pictures were taken to average PPVapp. The best predictive value for PPVapp to detect a PPVman > 13% was obtained for PPVappX1 by averaging 5 pictures showing a PPVapp threshold of 13.5% (95% CI, 12.9-15.2) and a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.989 (95% CI, 0.963-0.998) with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 94%. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that the Capstesia PPV calculation is a dependable substitute for standard manual PPV determination in a highly controlled environment (simulator study). Further studies are warranted to validate this mobile feature extraction technology to predict fluid responsiveness in real conditions.","output":"A Novel Mobile Phone Application for Pulse Pressure Variation Monitoring Based on Feature Extraction Technology: A Method Comparison Study in a Simulated Environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tularaemia caused by inhalation of type A Francisella tularensis bacteria is one of the most aggressive infectious diseases known, but the reasons for the very rapid spread of the organism from the lungs to internal organs and the ensuing mortality are unknown. The present study used the mouse model to examine in detail the host immune response in the lung. After an aerosol challenge with 20 c.f.u. of the type A strain FSC033, all mice developed clinical signs of severe disease, showed weight loss by day 4 of infection and died the next day. Histopathological findings in the lung revealed acute inflammation and intense vasculitis and perivasculitis on day 4. Gene transcriptional changes in the mouse lung samples were examined on days 1, 2 and 4 of infection using a cDNA microarray with 20,600 mouse clones representing 18,500 genes. In total, 424 genes were found to be differentially expressed, some of which were both up- and downregulated at different time points, 192 of which were upregulated and 234 of which were downregulated for at least one time point. A high percentage of selected genes identified by the microarray analysis were confirmed to be differentially regulated by quantitative real-time PCR. Categorization of the differentially expressed genes showed that those preferentially involved in host immune responses were activated extensively on day 4 but hardly or not at all on days 1 and 2. Further analysis revealed that several of the genes upregulated on day 4 are known to depend on gamma interferon or tumour necrosis factor alpha for their regulation. In keeping with this finding, tumour necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon levels were found to be increased significantly in bronchoalveolar lavage on day 4.","output":"Transcriptional profiling of host responses in mouse lungs following aerosol infection with type A Francisella tularensis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A short-cut review of the available medical literature was carried out to establish whether homemade or cloth face masks can prevent respiratory virus transmission or clinical illness.

Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to na?ve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four na?ve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two na?ve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.

The periodic outbreak of novel emerging and re-emerging infectious pathogens has elevated concerns and challenges for the future. To develop mitigation strategies against infectious diseases, nano-based approaches are being increasingly applied in diagnostic systems, prophylactic vaccines, and therapeutics. This review presents the properties of various nanoplatforms and discusses their role in the development of sensors, vectors, delivery agents, intrinsic immunostimulants, and viral inhibitors. Advanced nanomedical applications for infectious diseases have been highlighted. Moreover, physicochemical properties that confer physiological advantages and contribute to the control and inhibition of infectious diseases have been discussed. Safety concerns limit the commercial production and clinical use of these technologies in humans; however, overcoming these limitations may enable the use of nanomaterials to resolve current infection control issues via application of nanomaterials as a platform for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of viral diseases.","output":"Application of Nanomaterials as an Advanced Strategy for the Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment of Viral Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific knowledge is crucial to opening up new possibilities for major technological advances. When did science become important for economic development? The steam engine was the earliest major science-based invention. Conversely, the role of science has not been regarded as important in the innovations leading to modern steelmaking. In addition, how did science begin to play an important role? Mokyr focuses on the Industrial Enlightenment, which has its origins in the Baconian program of the seventeenth century. However, the role of science is often not regarded as important in the emergence of modern steelmaking technology. This paper examines the process through which modern steelmaking emerged and clarifies the role of science and Industrial Enlightenment. This discussion is also important in determining how to view the role of science in economic development and in considering the Great Divergence and the Great Knowledge Transcendence. In addition, the examination of this paper will show how to create radical innovations that are completely different from existing paradigms, and how to create new technological paradigms to overcome difficulties such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic and environmental problems. When much time elapses between scientific and technological advances, the role of science is often not regarded as important and sensational innovations such as the Bessemer process are emphasized. However, this is not a proper evaluation. The role of Industrial Enlightenment on the supply side must also be recognized as significant in the emergence of modern steelmaking technology.","output":"The Industrial Enlightenment and technological paradigms of the modern steel industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mathematical model reported here describes the dynamics of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which is different in many aspects from the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. We developed this model when the COVID-19 epidemic was at its early phase. We reasoned that, with our model, the effects of different measures could be assessed for infection control. Unlike the homogeneous models, our model accounts for human population heterogeneity, where subpopulations (e.g., age groups) have different infection risks. The heterogeneous model estimates several characteristics of the epidemic more accurately compared to the homogeneous models. According to our analysis, the total number of infections and their peak number are lower compared to the assessment with the homogeneous models. Furthermore, the early-stage infection increase is little changed when population heterogeneity is considered, whereas the late-stage infection decrease slows. The model predicts that the anti-epidemic measures, like the ones undertaken in China and the rest of the world, decrease the basic reproductive number but do not result in the development of a sufficient collective immunity, which poses a risk of a second wave. More recent developments confirmed our conclusion that the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart after the quarantine measures are lifted.","output":"COVID-19 Dynamics: A Heterogeneous Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have found that early corticosteroid therapy was effective for reducing morbidity during five Korea-wide epidemics.

METHODS P. berghei-infected mice were divided into six groups: infected control (IC) group, administered 1 mL Tween 20; GTE100 and GTE250 groups, administered 100 and 250 mg/kg GTE, respectively; GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups, co-administered 100 and 250 mg/kg GTE plus 30 mg/kg CQ, respectively; and CQ group, administered 30 mg/kg CQ. A separate group of non-infected mice were given 1 mL Tween 20, and served as a normal control group (NC). Extract and drug were dissolved in Tween 20 and administered orally once daily for 12 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were anesthetized with chloroform and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Plasma was prepared from blood obtained from each mouse. Parameters evaluated at the end of the treatment period include parasitemia, red blood cell count, hematocrit, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). RESULTS Infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups) showed significantly reduced parasitemia levels (P < 0.05) compared to those administered GTE alone as well as IC. Significant improvement in body weight (P < 0.05) was also observed in infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups), compared to mice receiving GTE alone (GTE100 and GTE250 groups). Plasma MDA and TNF- concentrations were significantly lowered, and IL-10 concentration was significantly increased in GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups, relative to the IC group (P < 0.05). GSH concentration and SOD, CAT and GPx activities were significantly higher in GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups compared to the GTE100, GTE250, IC and NC groups (P < 0.05).

Patients with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable risk population for worsening of their condition and relapse of symptoms. This study investigates the pandemic-related course of psychosocial burden in patients with pre-existing mental disorders. With the newly developed Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) psychosocial burden has been traced retrospectively (1) before the pandemic (beginning of 2020), (2) at its beginning under maximum lockdown conditions (March 2020), and (3) for the current state after maximum lockdown conditions (April/May 2020). The Goe-BSI also integrates the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM-20), assesses general psychiatric symptoms, and resilience. A total of 213 patients covering all major psychiatric disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed once in the time range from April, 24th until May 11th, 2020. Across all diagnoses patients exhibited a distinct pattern with an initial rise followed by a decline of psychosocial burden (p < 0.001, partial (2) = 0.09; Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons between all three time-points: p < 0.05 to 0.001). Female gender and high ADNM-20 scores were identified as risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden over time. Most psychiatric symptoms remained unchanged. Trajectories of psychosocial burden vary in parallel to local lockdown restrictions and seem to reflect an adaptive stress response. For female patients with pre-existing mental disorders and patients with high-stress responses, timely and specific treatment should be scheduled. With the continuation of the pandemic, monitoring of long-term effects is of major importance, especially when long incubation times for the development of mental health issues are considered.

This study investigated the facility-level nephrology practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associated challenges. Additionally, the treatment patterns and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with COVID-19 were reviewed. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey of 704 educational facilities that were certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) from October 20, 2020 to November 16, 2020. The questionnaire reviewed the facility characteristics, infection prevention measures taken during routine nephrology practice, impact of COVID-19 on nephrology practice, experiences in managing CKD patients with COVID-19, and nosocomial transmission in the nephrology unit. RESULTS: Of the 347 facilities that responded, 95.1% checked outpatients' body temperatures and COVID-19 symptoms at their visits. To reduce face-to-face contact, 80% and 70% of the facilities lengthened the intervals between outpatient visits and introduced online/telephonic consultations, respectively. As a result, more than half of the hospitals experienced a decrease in the numbers of outpatients and inpatients (64% and 50%, respectively). During the study period, 347 facilities managed 479 CKD patients with COVID-19. Oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation were performed for 47.8% and 16.5% of the patients, respectively, with a 9.2% total mortality rate.

Demographic, comorbidity and laboratory determinants of death and of ICU admission were explored in all Danish hospitalised patients. METHODS: National health registries were used to identify all hospitalized patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and laboratory results on admission and explored prognostic factors for death using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and competing risk survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 2431 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 between February 27 and July 8 (median age 69 years [IQR 53-80], 54.1% males), 359 (14.8%) needed admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 455 (18.7%) died within 30 days of follow-up. The seven-day cumulative incidence of ICU admission was lower for females (7.9%) than for males (16.7%), (p < 0.001). Age, high CCI, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), urea, creatinine, lymphopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia within 24-h of admission were independently associated with death within the first week in the multivariate analysis. Conditional upon surviving the first week, male sex, age, high CCI, elevated CRP, LDH, creatinine, urea and neutrophil count were independently associated with death within 30 days. Males presented with more pronounced laboratory abnormalities on admission. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, male sex, comorbidity, higher levels of systemic inflammation and cell-turnover were independent factors for mortality. Age was the strongest predictor for death, moderate to high level of comorbidity were associated with a nearly two-fold increase in mortality. Mortality was significantly higher in males after surviving the first week.","output":"First wave of COVID-19 hospital admissions in Denmark: a Nationwide population-based cohort study"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/8.md","filePath":"drive/8.md"}'),R={name:"drive/8.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
