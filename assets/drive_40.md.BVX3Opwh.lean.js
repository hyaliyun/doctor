While many previous deep learning models have been proposed for this disease, they need sufficient professional annotation data to train the model, requiring more expensive and time-consuming screening skills. METHOD: This study aims to economize manual power and proposes a deep graph correlation network (DGCN) to develop automated diabetic retinopathy grading without any professional annotations. DGCN involves the novel deep learning algorithm of a graph convolutional network to exploit inherent correlations from independent retinal image features learned by a convolutional neural network. Three designed loss functions of graph-center, pseudo-contrastive, and transformation-invariant constrain the optimisation and application of the DGCN model in an automated diabetic retinopathy grading task. RESULTS: To evaluate the DGCN model, this study employed EyePACS-1 and Messidor-2 sets to perform grading results. It achieved an accuracy of 89.9% (91.8%), sensitivity of 88.2% (90.2%), and specificity of 91.3% (93.0%) on EyePACS-1 (Messidor-2) data set with a confidence index of 95% and commendable effectiveness on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and t-SNE plots. CONCLUSION: The grading capability of this study is close to that of retina specialists, but superior to that of trained graders, which demonstrates that the proposed DGCN provides an innovative route for automated diabetic retinopathy grading and other computer-aided diagnostic systems.","output":"Diabetic Retinopathy Grading by Deep Graph Correlation Network on Retinal Images Without Manual Annotations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurocritical care is a growing subspecialty.

It compares English prescribing data from May 2014 to May 2021, including the period of 'lockdown', from April 20-June 20. DESIGN & SETTING: A retrospective analysis of the English Prescribing Dataset which reports monthly on prescribed items from English General Practices was carried out. Data on all forms of prescribed contraceptive methods were extracted using British National Formulary (BNF) codes, and total quantities tabulated by method, then transformed into 'months of contraception provided' by each method. RESULTS: Prescription of the combined oral contraceptive pill reduced by 22% during the period of lockdown compared to the same three months in 2019. Prescriptions of Progestogen-Only pills remained stable. This continued a trend in oral contraceptive prescribing evident from May14. Prescription of long-acting methods reduced during the period of lockdown, with the greatest reductions in implants (76% reduction from pre-lockdown levels), intra-uterine systems (79% reduction from pre-lockdown levels) and intrauterine devices (76% reduction from pre-lockdown levels). These rates of contraceptive provision recovered quickly after the period of lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The disruption of face-to-face contraceptive consultations in General Practice during a Covid-19 'lockdown' has resulted in a reduction in oestrogen -containing methods compared to progestogen-only methods, which require less face-to-face monitoring. Implant and intrauterine contraceptive device prescription reduced by three quarters over the first three months of lockdown, but rebounded in the next year.","output":"Effect of the Covid pandemic on progestogen-only and oestrogen-containing contraceptive prescribing in general practice: a retrospective analysis of English prescribing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of study was to evaluate the retinal layers and macular capillary network with OCTA in acromegaly patients, to compare with healthy population.

Objective EDs measure metrics such as walk-out rate (WOR), which is reflected in leaving against medical advice (AMA), elopement, left after triage (LAFT), and left without being seen (LWBS). In this study, we sought to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ED WOR. Methods A retrospective analysis was used to assess the overall ED census and the walk-out rate for three community EDs during the March to June 2020 national lockdown. This period was compared to the same period for 2019. Results The walk-out rate during the COVID-19 pandemic was inversely proportional to the overall ED census. While overall ED visits decreased by 26% to 42% during the period of March to June 2020 as compared to March to June 2019, the patient walk-out rates increased from 25% to 65%. Conclusion The national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic created a paradoxical finding with a decrease in ED census but an increase in ED walk-out rates. This decline in census and increase in WOR raises concern that patients avoid going to the hospitals to seek medical attention because the concern of contracting the virus prevails, resulting in increased walkouts. With this retrospective study, we can anticipate that future newly discovered emerging diseases causing national lockdowns will result in a high probability of avoidance of emergency care.","output":"Retrospective Analysis of the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Emergency Department Walk-Out Rate in an Acute Care Community Hospital During the USA National Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2015, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus occurred in Saudi Arabia and necessitated special measures to be implemented to control the spread of the virus.

In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. Methods: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. Results: A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies.

Worsening infected patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, associated with 30% of mortality. A part of worsening is mediated by haemostasis deregulation. The primary aim of this study was to determine if haematological biomarkers, in addition to clinical risk factors on hospital admission, predict worsening (defined by ICU admission and/or death) in Covid-19 infected patients, and secondary, if they could predict the occurrence of thrombotic events. Thirty-five of the 99 patients got clinically worse and 8 developed pulmonary embolism (PE). Final model of the logistic regression analysis revealed that oxygenodependence (RR=7.27[1.50-19.31]), fibrinogen levels (RR=1.45[1.17-1.82]), thrombin peak (RR=1.28[1.03-1.59]), monocytes counts below 0.2 G/L (RR=2.88[1.67-3.19]) and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) higher than 290 pM (RR=2.39[1.20-3.30]) were associated with clinical worsening. Fibrinogen level threshold of 5.5 g/L, thrombin peak measurement threshold of 99 pM and oxygenodepence allowed prediction of clinical outcome in near than 80% of our cohort. Moreover, using ROC curves, thrombin peak and F1+2 on admission with a threshold of 204 nM and 393 pM were sensitive and specific to predict PE (AUC: 85.7% Se: 70.8% Sp: 100% and AUC: 81.5% Se: 75.0% Sp: 86.8% respectively). In conclusion, we described a rapid decision tree to predict outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients based on fibrinogen, TGA peak and oxygen dependence.

Many plus-strand RNA viruses employ largescale intra-genomic RNA-RNA interactions as a means to control viral processes. Here, we describe an elaborate RNA structure formed by multiple distant regions in a tombusvirus genome that activates transcription of a viral subgenomic mRNA. The initial step in assembly of this intramolecular RNA complex involves the folding of a large viral RNA domain, which generates a discontinuous binding pocket. Next, a distally-located protracted stem-loop RNA structure docks, via base-pairing, into the binding site and acts as a linchpin that stabilizes the RNA complex and activates transcription. A multi-step RNA folding pathway is proposed in which rate-limiting steps contribute to a delay in transcription of the capsid protein-encoding viral subgenomic mRNA.

SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host is mediated by binding of viral spike protein to the Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is an essential member of the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) involved in maintaining the blood pressure and vascular remodelling. Although ACE2 receptor is the entry point to the host, recent studies show activation of ACE2 to modulate the host to develop a suitable environment for its replication. However, the ACE2 activating the immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 attachment is still under investigation. We have used systems biological approach to construct the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2 receptor. Since lungs are the primary infection site, we integrate human lung gene expression profile along with the host regulatory network to demonstrate the altered host signalling mechanism in viral infection. Further, the network was functionally enriched to determine immune modulation in the network. We also used the proteomic database to assess the occurrence of similar signalling events in other human tissues that exhibit lineage of infection across different organs. The constructed network contains 133 host proteins with 298 interactions that directly or indirectly connect to the ACE2 receptor. Among 133 proteins, 29 were found to be differentially regulated in the host lungs on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altered proteins connect multiple proteins in a network that modulates kinase, carboxypeptidase and cytokine activity, leading to changes in the host immune system, cell cycle and signal transduction mechanisms. Further investigation showed the presence of similar signalling events in the kidneys, placenta, pancreas, testis, small intestine and adrenal gland as well. Overall, our results will help in understanding the immune molecular regulatory networks influenced by the ACE2 mediated interaction in other body tissues, which may aid in identifying the secondary health complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2/human interactome reveals ACE2 locus crosstalk with the immune regulatory network in the host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are limited proven therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Drawing on a large-scale dataset which covers more than 1.4M posts and 18M comments from an online social media platform, we investigate the propagation of two distinct narrativesC(i) conspiracy information, whose claims are generally unsubstantiated and thus referred as misinformation to some extent, and (ii) scientific information, whose origins are generally readily identifiable and verifiable. We find that conspiracy cascades tend to propagate in a multigenerational branching process whereas science cascades are more likely to grow in a breadth-first manner. Specifically, conspiracy information triggers larger cascades, involves more users and generations, persists longer, and is more viral and bursty than science information. Content analysis reveals that conspiracy cascades contain more negative words and emotional words which convey anger, fear, disgust, surprise and trust. We also find that conspiracy cascades are much more concerned with political and controversial topics. After applying machine learning models, we achieve an AUC score of nearly 90% in discriminating conspiracy from science narratives using the constructed features. We further investigate users role during the growth of cascades. In contrast with previous assumption that misinformation is primarily driven by a small set of users, we find that conspiracy cascades are more likely to be controlled by a broader set of users than science cascades, imposing new challenges on the management of misinformation. Although political affinity is thought to affect the consumption of misinformation, there is very little evidence that political orientation of the information source plays a role during the propagation of conspiracy information; Instead, we find that conspiracy information from media outlets with left or right orientation triggers smaller cascades and is less viral than information from online social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Imgur) whose political orientations are unclear. Our study provides complementing evidence to current misinformation research and has practical policy implications to stem the propagation and mitigate the influence of misinformation online.","output":"Conspiracy vs science: A large-scale analysis of online discussion cascades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines against COVID-19 (and its emerging variants) are an essential global intervention to control the current pandemic situation. Vaccines often cause adverse events; however, the vast majority of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are a consequence of the vaccine stimulating a protective immune response, and not allergic in etiology. Anaphylaxis as an AEFI is uncommon, occurring at a rate of less than 1 per million doses for most vaccines. However, within the first days of initiating mass vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, there were reports of anaphylaxis from the UK and USA. More recent data implies an incidence of anaphylaxis closer to 1:125,000 doses with respect to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In this position paper, we discuss the background to reactions to the current COVID-19 vaccines and relevant steps to mitigate against the risk of anaphylaxis as an AEFI. We propose a global surveillance strategy led by allergists in order to understand the potential risk and generate data to inform evidence-based guidance, and thus provide reassurance to public health bodies and members of the public.","output":"COVID-19 VACCINE-ASSOCIATED ANAPHYLAXIS: A STATEMENT OF THE WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION ANAPHYLAXIS COMMITTEE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lives of millions of people have been affected during the coronavirus pandemic that spread throughout the world in 2020.

METHODS: We used data on 7.69 million outpatient visits to primary (i.e. vision centres), secondary and tertiary Aravind Eye Care Systems centres between January 2019 and June 2021. We compared outpatient numbers and outpatients age and sex between the pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period in 2019 for all centres, whereas vision and ophthalmic assessments were compared for vision centres only. FINDINGS: During the first wave, the number of outpatient visits at tertiary, secondary and vison centres was 39% (647 968/1 656 296), 60% (170 934/283 176) and 73% (180 502/246 282) respectively, of 2019 levels. During the second wave, outpatient visits at tertiary, secondary and vision centres were 54% (385 092/710 949), 73% (88 383/121 739) and 79% (121 993/154 007), respectively, of 2019 levels. The proportion of outpatients who were female or younger than 20 years or older than 60 years was significantly lower during the first and second waves than in 2019 (P < 0.0001 for all). The proportion of outpatients whose worse eye vision was poorer than 5/60 or who required referral was significantly higher (P < 0.0001 for both). CONCLUSION: Restrictive measurements led to declines in outpatient visits, however the decline was less at secondary and vision centres than at tertiary centres.

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the need to identify genetic risk factors for susceptibility to this serious illness has emerged. Host genetic factors, along with other risk factors may help determine susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. It is hypothesized that the ACE2 gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a genetic risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and is required by the virus to enter cells. Together with ACE2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) also play an important role in disease severity. Evaluating the role of genetic variants in determining the direction of respiratory infections will help identify potential drug target candidates for further study in COVID-19 patients.

For this cross-sectional study, 641 residents in Saudi Arabia over the age of 17 years were recruited between November and December of 2020 to complete an online survey. The survey assessed depression levels (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), the sense of control and perceptions of public health restrictions. Demographic information was also collected. Depression levels were higher compared to previous samples (d = 0.12). The number of restrictions perceived as distressing strongly predicted the probability of high BDI scores, [Formula: see text] , with higher sense of control predicting lower levels of depression (constraints, [Formula: see text] , mastery, [Formula: see text]). A strong sense of control significantly reduced the impact of the perception of restrictions on depression. These results suggest that the perception of public health restrictions is part of the reason for increased levels of depression during the pandemic. A strong sense control reduced the impact of restrictions on depression.

However, whether chitosan can further treat olfactory dysfunction in vivo remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chitosan on a 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylindole is performed to induce anosmia in rats. Experimental results demonstrate that the food-finding duration after chitosan treatment gradually decrease to around 80 s, and both the olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) thickness and mature ORNs (expressing olfactory marker protein) are significantly restored. Furthermore, proliferating cells (expressing bromodeoxyuridine) are mainly co-expressed with immature ORNs (expressing III tubulin) below the intermediate layer of the ON in the chitosan-treated group on day 28 following 3-methylindole treatment. Conversely, proliferating cells are scattered over the ON, and co-localized with immature ORNs and sustentacular cells (expressing keratin 18) in the sham group, and even immature ORNs go into apoptosis (expressing DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3), possibly causing incomplete regeneration. Consequently, chitosan regenerates the ON by regulating olfactory neural homeostasis and reducing ORN apoptosis, and serves as a potential therapeutic intervention for olfactory dysfunction in the future.","output":"Regeneration of olfactory neuroepithelium in 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rats treated with intranasal chitosan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy utilizing natural killer cell-activated receptor natural-killer group-2 member D ligands (NKG2DLs) has had preclinical success in the treatment of small cell lung cancer.

This study aims to compare the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes in patients with fulminant giant cell myocarditis (FGCM) and fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis (FLM). Methods and Results: In our retrospective study, nine patients with FGCM (mean age 47.9  7.5 years, six female) and 7 FLM (mean age 42.1  12.3 years, four female) patients confirmed by histology in the last 11 years were included. Most patients with FGCM and FLM were NYHA functional class IV (56 vs. 100%, p = 0.132). Patients with FGCM had significantly lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP, 4.4 (2.0C10.2) mg/L vs. 13.6 (12.6C14.6) mg/L, P = 0.004, data shown as the median with IQR], creatine kinase-myoglobin [CK-MB, 1.4 (1.0C3.2) ng/ml vs. 14.6 (3.0C64.9) ng/ml, P = 0.025, median with IQR], and alanine aminotransferase [ALT, 38.0 (25.0C61.5) IU/L vs. 997.0 (50.0C3,080.0) IU/L, P = 0.030, median with IQR] and greater right ventricular end-diastolic diameter (RVEDD) [2.9  0.3 cm vs. 2.4  0.6 cm, P = 0.034, mean  SD] than those with FLM.

The long-term survival rate was significantly lower in FGCM group compared with FLM group (0 vs. 71.4%, p = 0.022). A multivariate cox regression analysis showed the level of hs-CRP (hazard ratio = 0.871, 95% confidence interval: 0.761C0.996, P = 0.043) was an independent prognostic factor for FM patients. Furthermore, the level of hs-CRP had a good ability to discriminate between patients with FGCM and FLM (AUC = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.4213C0.9964). Conclusions: The inflammatory response and myocardial damage in the patients with FGCM were milder than those with FLM. Patients with FGCM had distinctly poorer prognoses compared with those with FLM. Our results suggest that hs-CRP could be a promising prognostic biomarker and a hs-CRP level of 11.71 mg/L is an appropriate cutoff point for the differentiating diagnosis between patients with FGCM and FLM.","output":"Fulminant Giant Cell Myocarditis vs. Lymphocytic Myocarditis: A Comparison of Their Clinical Characteristics, Treatments, and Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Handwashing with soap has received considerable attention due to its importance in the prevention and interruption of the transmission of diseases.

Multinomial regression was used to assess multivariate predictors of changes to CI and CB due to COVID-19. Results showed a significant U-shaped association between initial CB and CB change due to COVID-19.

Mutations, insertions, deletions, and replacements of the viral genome have been employed to study the structure function relationship, foreign gene expression, functional complementation, and virulence determinants. Essential regions and non-essential regions for viral replication have been identified in both the coding regions and non-encoding regions. Foreign sequences have successfully been inserted into the nsp2 and N regions and in the space between ORF1b and ORF2a.

Growing public concerns have been raised over the management and control of this new form of plastic pollution, and one of the proposed sustainable solution is to use renewable and/or biodegradable resources to develop mask materials in order to minimize their environmental impacts. As a representative biodegradable polymer, polylactic acid (PLA) has been proposed as a promising candidate to produce non-woven face masks instead of those fossil-based polymers. To further explore the feasibility of this alternative mask material, the present work aims to study both the hydrolytic and bio-degradation behaviors of pure PLA-derived 3-ply disposable face masks at ambient temperature. Hydrolytic degradability was investigated at different pH conditions of 2, 7 and 13 with the whole piece of face mask soaked for regular timed intervals up to 8 weeks. Weight loss study showed neutral and acidic conditions had minimal effect on PLA masks, but rapid degradation occurred under basic conditions in the first week with a sharp 25% decrease in weight that slowly tapered off, coupled with solution pH dropping from 13 to 9.6. This trend was supported by mechanical property, bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) studies. Masks soaked in basic conditions had their modulus and tensile strength dropped by more than 50% after 8 weeks where the middle layer reached 68% and 90% respectively just after 48 h, and BFE and PFE decreased by 14% and 43% respectively after 4 weeks, which was much more significant than those in neutral and acidic conditions. Base degradation was also supported by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR), which disclosed that only the middle layer undergo major degradation with random chain scission and cleavage of enol or enolate chain ends, while outer and inner layers were much less affected. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attributed this observation to thinner PLA fibers for the middle layer of 3C7 m diameter, which on average is 3 times smaller. This degradation was further supported by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) which saw an increase in lower molecular weight fragment Mw ~ 800 Da with soaking duration. The biodegradation behavior was studied under OECD 301F specification in sewage sludge environment. Similarly, degradation to the middle meltblown layer was more extensive, where the average weight loss and carbon loss was 25.8% and 25.7% respectively, double that of outer/inner spunbond layer. The results showed that the face masks did not completely disintegrate after 8 weeks, but small solubilized fragments of PLA formed in the biodegradation process can be completely mineralized into carbon dioxide without generation of secondary microplastic pollution in the environment. PLA masks are therefore a slightly greener option to consider in times of a pandemic that the world was caught unprepared; however future research on masks could be geared towards a higher degradability material that fully breaks down into non-harmful components while maintaining durability, filtration and protection properties for users.","output":"Polylactic acid face masks: Are these the sustainable solutions in times of COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the overall fatality rate of severe and critical patients with COVID-19 is high and the effective therapy is limited.

The therapy significantly improved the patient's clinical symptoms, oxygenation status, and radiological characteristics of lung injury during hospitalization, and the patient showed good tolerance and avoided intubation. Additionally, we did not find that medical staff wearing optimal airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) were infected by the new coronavirus in our institution.

As replication of many viruses - including MERS-CoV - is supported by enhanced aerobic glycolysis, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells (especially airway cells) is reliant upon altered glucose metabolism. This metabolism is similar to the Warburg effect well studied in cancer. Counteracting two main pathways (PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling) sustaining aerobic glycolysis inhibits MERS-CoV replication and thus, very likely that of SARS-CoV-2, which shares many similarities with MERS-CoV. The Warburg effect appears to be involved in several steps of COVID-19 infection. Once induced by hypoxia, the Warburg effect becomes active in lung endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of atherosclerosis, thereby promoting vasoconstriction and micro thrombosis. Aerobic glycolysis also supports activation of pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and M1 macrophages. As the anti-inflammatory response and reparative process is performed by M2 macrophages reliant on oxidative metabolism, we speculated that the switch to oxidative metabolism in M2 macrophages would not occur at the appropriate time due to an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cascade. Aging, mitochondrial senescence and enzyme dysfunction, AMPK downregulation and p53 inactivation could all play a role in this key biochemical event. Understanding the role of the Warburg effect in COVID-19 can be essential to developing molecules reducing infectivity, arresting endothelial cells activation and the pro-inflammatory cascade.","output":"The key role of Warburg effect in SARS-CoV-2 replication and associated inflammatory response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid has killed millions, and millions more are being infected every day.

A polycarbonate prototype was developed consisting of a central cargo space to house sensors and battery, with a separate retention module. Mathematical modelling informed the required length and flexibility of the arms on the retention module to reduce pressure necrosis and inflammation within the vagina. The prototype was initially trialled, with a loaded cargo pod, for 4 weeks in five non-pregnant cows. Cows were monitored for signs of systemic infection and inflammation by collecting blood samples for haematology and acute phase inflammatory proteins. Cows were also assessed for general demeanour, signs of discomfort and positioning of the device. Later, the device was inserted into 20 early pregnant cows, with 20 contemporary, untreated controls. Cows were monitored, as in the initial trial, every 4 weeks for the next 5 to 6 months until calving. RESULTS: In Trial 1, there was 100% retention with no adverse effects. In Trial 2, device retention was 75% until calving with no adverse effects on cow health or pregnancy.

METHODS Fourteen patients with tumors in or close to the precentral gyrus were examined using nTMS for motor cortex mapping, as were 12 patients with lesions in the subcortical white matter motor tract. Moreover, preoperative fMR imaging and intraoperative mapping of the motor cortex were performed via DCS, and the outlining of the motor cortex was compared. RESULTS In the 14 cases of lesions affecting the precentral gyrus, the primary motor cortex as outlined by nTMS correlated well with that delineated by intraoperative DCS mapping, with a deviation of 4.4  3.4 mm between the two methods. In comparing nTMS with fMR imaging, the deviation between the two methods was much larger: 9.8  8.5 mm for the upper extremity and 14.7  12.4 mm for the lower extremity. In 13 of 14 cases, the surgeon admitted easier identification of the central region because of nTMS.

These changes have rekindled debates about the validity and legitimacy of global health estimates. This paper draws on country case studies and personal experience to support our opinion that the production and use of estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political, and ideational contexts, which vary at different levels of the global health architecture. Broadly, most global health estimates tend to be made far from the localities where the data upon which they are based are collected and where the results of estimation processes must ultimately be used if they are to make a difference to the health of individuals. Internationally standardised indicators are necessary, but they are no substitute for data that meet local needs and that fit with local ideas of what is credible and useful - in other words, data that are both technically and socially robust for those who make key decisions about health. We suggest that greater engagement of local actors (and local data) in the formulation, communication, and interpretation of health estimates would increase the likelihood that these data will be used by those most able to translate them into health gains for the longer term. Besides strengthening national information systems, this requires ongoing interaction, building trust, and establishing a communicative infrastructure.

METHOD ology: Three census-based measures of self-reported health (number of chronic physical disabilities; activity limitation (a little; a lot); and chronic poor mental health) were linked to contemporaneous DLA records. The 2011 Census returns provided individual demographic, socio-economic, social and area-level characteristics. DLA uptake was modelled using logistic regression, stratified into 0-15 and 16-64 year old age groups. RESULTS Overall, 118329 (8.4%) of this population received DLA. Poor health outcomes were the main determinants for uptake, which was higher amongst females, those non-married and those of lower socio-economic status: for example those with no qualifications compared against third level education (ORad = 1.80: 95%CI = 1.75-1.85); and those social renting compared against those in more expensive owner occupation (ORadj = 1.92: 1.83-2.02).

On the other hand, from the Dialogical Approach to Argumentation and Polyphony, this paper proposes to address inclusive language resources as subjectivity and polyphony marks which evidence certain aspects of the discourse of patriarchy, with respect to which there is dissent; therefore, inclusive language resources show viewpoints that were once silenced and rejected. For this, a corpus of various speeches is addressed, made up of outdoor urban inscriptions, flyers (advertisements), audiovisual informative speeches and digital press, written in inclusive language, between 2018 and 2020. Throughout the paper it is warns that the inclusive language marks, such as Ce and x, are traces of the heterogeneity shown marked that object to grammatical binarism and convey comments by the subject about their own enunciation, alluding to the image of previous sexist and patriarchal discourses with whom they disagree. The analysis reveals that the words or expressions in which inclusive language resources are employed (-e and x) work as traces of harassed identities and manifest comments by the speaker on their own enunciation. This way, this research shows that gender inclusive language holds conflict linguistic marks which point to historically denied dissidence forms, linked to gender identity and the assertion of collective rights. Finally, this article aims at, on the one hand, contributing to the description of Argentinean Spanish, and on the other, promoting reflection in favor of linguistic education. Undoubtedly, opening instances of debate on the subject can have an impact on the deepening of linguistic reflection and the training of speakers who contribute to forging a more egalitarian society, one which is inclusive and respectful of differences.","output":"Linguistic Traces of Subjectivity and Dissent.

Immigrants and racialized communities including Chinese Canadians experience high level of access barriers including communication with clinicians. With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8 years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care. More participants in the iCCAS group were referred to a social worker or psychiatrist. Patients found the use of iCCAS easy and clinicians identified its benefits for themselves (eg, early identification and comfort) and patients (eg, self-awareness and anonymity) and proposed practice-integration. DISCUSSION: The studied tool holds promise for enhancing clinician-patient mental health communications in primary care settings for overseas Chinese. Implications are discussed for in-person and virtual healthcare which could also inform responses to mental health crisis related to COVID-19.","output":"Interactive mental health assessments for Chinese Canadians: A pilot randomized controlled trial in nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, the COVID\\\\19 outbreak and governmental lockdowns changed the everyday lives of families with children worldwide. Due to remote work recommendations and the closing of school premises and childcare centers, workCfamily boundaries became blurred in many families. In this study, we examine the possibly gendered boundary work practices among Finnish parents during the COVID\\\\19 lockdown in spring 2020 by asking, how do parents perceive the blurring of workCfamily boundaries? What kind of boundary work practices did families develop to manage their work and family roles, and were these practices gendered and how? Boundary practices are analyzed by combining theories of doing boundaries and gender theories in the context of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and applying them to survey data. The results revealed that during lockdown, both spatial and temporal boundaries blurred or partly disappeared, and boundary practices developed by families were highly gendered. Especially in families where childcare practices had been gendered already before the lockdown, it was predominantly mothers, who shouldered the main responsibility of increased childcare and struggled to manage their work duties. Hence, families had varying means to cope with blurring boundaries based on their ability to switch to remote work, but also on their workCfamily practices before the pandemic.","output":"Gendering boundary work: Experiences of workCfamily practices among Finnish working parents during COVID\\\\19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyloid-?42 (A?42) peptides are central to the amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Several tools and protocols have been shared since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they need to be timely adapted to cope with SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus genetic material has been widely used, it still presents practical difficulties such as high cost, shortage of available reagents in the global market, need of a specialized laboratorial infrastructure and well-trained staff. These limitations result in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance blackouts across several countries. Here we propose a rapid and accessible protocol based on Sanger sequencing of a single PCR fragment that is able to identify and discriminate all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) identified so far, according to each characteristic mutational profile at the Spike-RBD region (K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, A570D). Twelve COVID-19 samples from Brazilian patients were evaluated for both WGS and Sanger sequencing: three P.2, two P.1, six B.1.1 and one B.1.1.117 lineage. All results from the Sanger sequencing method perfectly matched the mutational profile of VOCs and non-VOCs RBD's characterized by WGS. In summary, this approach allows a much broader network of laboratories to perform molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and report results within a shorter time frame, which is of utmost importance in the context of rapid public health decisions in a fast evolving worldwide pandemic.","output":"A Sanger-based approach for scaling up screening of SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work studied the morphological and anatomical characteristics in young plants of Chorisia speciosa, cultivated under drained soil and flood conditions (control).

The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between hospitalized men and women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multicenter, retrospective, observational study is based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. We analyzed the differences between men and women for a wide variety of demographic, clinical, and treatment variables, and the sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as intensive care unit (ICU) admission by age subgroups. This work analyzed 12,063 patients (56.8% men). The women in our study were older than the men, on average (67.9 vs. 65.7 years; p < 001). Bilateral condensation was more frequent among men than women (31.8% vs. 29.9%; p = 0.007). The men needed non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation more frequently (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001, and 7.9% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001, respectively). The most prevalent complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome, with severe cases in 19.9% of men (p < 0.001). In men, intensive care unit admission was more frequent (10% vs. 6.1%; p < 0.001) and the mortality rate was higher (23.1% vs. 18.9%; p < 0.001). Regarding mortality, the differences by gender were statistically significant in the age groups from 55 years to 89 years of age. A multivariate analysis showed that female sex was significantly and independently associated with a lower risk of mortality in our study. Male sex appears to be related to worse progress in COVID-19 patients and is an independent prognostic factor for mortality.

Post-COVID-19 mucormycosis is one of such sequelae, which is a dreadful and rare entity. The purpose of this report was to study the full spectrum of this dual infection in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). METHODS: We did a comprehensive analysis of 11 mucormycosis cases in KTR who recovered from COVID-19 in IKDRC, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India during the study period from Nov 2020 to May 2021. We also looked for the risk factors for mucormycosis with a historical cohort of 157 KTR who did not develop mucormycosis. RESULTS: The median age (interquartile range, range) of the cohort was 42 (33.5C50, 26C60) years with 54.5% diabetes. COVID-19 severity ranged from mild (n = 10) to severe cases (n = 1). The duration from COVID-19 recovery to presentation was 7 (7C7, 4C14) days. Ten cases were Rhino-orbital-cerebral-mucormycosis (ROCM) and one had pulmonary mucormycosis. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) was performed in all cases of ROCM. The duration of antifungal therapy was 28 (24C30, 21C62) days. The mortality rate reported was 27%. The risk factors for post-transplant mucormycosis were diabetes (18% vs 54.5%; p-value = 0.01), lymphopenia [12 (10C18) vs 20 (12C26) %; p-value = 0.15] and a higher neutrophilClymphocyte ratio [7 (4.6C8.3) vs 3.85 (3.3C5.8); p-value = 0.5].

Indeed, it has been suggested that the death rate in developing countries may be far lower than in high-income countries - an outcome that would be starkly different from the typical pattern for many other infectious diseases. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature to identify all serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples of specimens collected by early 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analyzed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible. Results Seroprevalence in many developing country locations was markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity. In most locations, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age-groups. Age-specific IFRs were 1.3-2.5x higher than in high-income countries. The median value of population IFR was 0.5% among developing countries with satisfactory death reporting as of 2016, compared to a median of 0.05% for other developing countries. Conclusion The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare.

Methods We reviewed patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at a single hospital in the Republic of Korea. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients deteriorating with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) <94% on room air up to day 28. Findings A total of 127 patients were treated with regdanvimab, 190 with SoC. The proportion of patients deteriorating with SpO2 <94% on room air up to day 28 was 13.4% with regdanvimab and 39.5% with SoC (P<0.0001); median time (range) until sustained recovery of fever was 2.0 (0.2C14.8) and 4.2 (0.1C17.1) days, respectively.

Conversion disorder, previously known as hysteria, is a somatoform disorder that causes neurological deficits without anatomical or physiological explanations. It is particularly rare after general anesthesia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old healthy Japanese woman presented tetraplegia with normal sensory function upon waking from general anesthesia. She was evaluated for the causes of tetraplegia. There were no abnormal findings, and her symptoms were inconsistent with any anatomical or neurological pathology. Although she could not flex her knee actively, she could maintain the passive flexed position, suggesting that her paralysis was nonorganic. The most likely diagnosis was conversion disorder. After a 12-h observation, the patient fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with neurological deficits not correlating with neurological findings after general anesthesia, the presence of somatic disorders, such as conversion disorder, should be considered.","output":"Postoperative tetraplegia due to conversion disorder upon emergence from general anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Is financial fraud becoming a bigger or smaller problem over time? Current empirical approaches to this question generate mixed inferences. As an alternative, I use two theoretical constructs that isolate several factors that motivate fraud, and use them to consider the impact of technological and wealth changes over time. Some changes, such as an increase in anonymity in some financial transactions, facilitate new fraud innovations and increase the possibility of fraud. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic shutdown has fostered major disruptions in relative demands and organizational capital that also increase the likelihood of fraud over the next few years. Viewed over a longer time scale, however, the majority of technological and wealth changes seem likely to increase the use and effectiveness of reputational capital, third-party enforcement, and ethical motivations as fraud deterrents.

These include apathy and anhedonia, common issues in PD, which can be quantified with the help of evaluation scales recommended by the literature. There are sensory non-motor manifestations of PD, some of which are easy to detect through electrophysiological studies. Our aim was to investigate the possible association of apathy and anhedonia with the severity of the motor status in a sample of PD patients in Romania. We also examined the prevalence of latency changes in the P100 wave of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and how they correlated with motor status, apathy, and anhedonia in PD patients. Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD participated in this study. All were assessed for motor status using the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and were rated on the Hoehn and Yahr scales. The presence and severity of apathy and anhedonia were assessed using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), the Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS), the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), and the SnaithCHamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). The latency of the P100 wave of the VEP was measured in all the patients. Results: Apathy and anhedonia were common among the patients with PD (35% and 58.8%, respectively). The presence of apathy/anhedonia was correlated with the severity of motor symptoms, as assessed using the UPDRS scale (p < 0.001), and with the stage of the disease according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale (p < 0.001). A prolonged latency of the P100 wave of the VEP was observed among apathetic (p < 0.001)/anhedonic (p < 0.01) patients and those with increased disease severity (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Apathy and anhedonia are common in PD and may correlate with the severity of motor symptoms. There may be visual impairment in these patients, evidenced by a prolonged P100 latency, which correlates with the severity of disease. Significance: Scales for assessing apathy and anhedonia, as well as measuring VEP latency, could be useful in assessing the severity of disease.","output":"Apathy and Anhedonia: Clinical and Neurophysiological Assessment of a Romanian Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) identified in 2019.

It is primarily associated with mechanical ventilation leading to severe illness, high mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. The risk of mortality has increased over time due to the rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections, which represent a global public health threat. Respiratory tract microbiome (RTM) research is growing, and recent studies suggest that a healthy RTM positively stimulates the immune system and, like the gut microbiome, can protect against pathogen infection through colonization resistance (CR). Physiological conditions of critical patients and interventions as antibiotics administration and mechanical ventilation dramatically alter the RTM, leading to dysbiosis. The dysbiosis of the RTM of ICU patients favors the colonization by opportunistic and resistant pathogens that can be part of the microbiota or acquired from the hospital environments (biotic or built ones). Despite recent evidence demonstrating the significance of RTM in nosocomial infections, most of the host-RTM interactions remain unknown. In this context, we present our perspective regarding research in RTM altered ecology in the clinical environment, particularly as a risk for acquisition of nosocomial pneumonia.

Here we analysed COVID-19 data and explored possible explanations to better understand the disease burden in the context of Rwanda's infection control strategies.We investigated whether the age distribution plays a role in the observed low CFR in Rwanda by comparing the expected number of deaths for 10-year age bands based on the CFR reported in other countries with the observed number of deaths for each age group. We found that the age-specific CFRs in Rwanda are similar to or, in some older age groups, slightly higher than those in other countries, suggesting that the lower population level CFR reflects the younger age structure in Rwanda, rather than a lower risk of death conditional on age. We also accounted for Rwanda's comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies and reliable documentation of COVID-19-related deaths and deduced that these measures may have allowed them to likely identify more asymptomatic or mild cases than other countries and reduced their reported CFR.Overall, the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Rwanda is likely influenced by the combination of effective infection control strategies, reliable identification of cases and reporting of deaths, and the population's young age structure.","output":"One hundred thirty-three observed COVID-19 deaths in 10 months: unpacking lower than predicted mortality in Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most important incidents in the world in 2020 is the outbreak of the Coronavirus.

Here, we studied 110 acidic soils (average pHa?4.5) collected across 700-km subtropical forests with a gradient of available phosphorus (AP) ranging from 0.21 to 17.6a?mg/kg. We analyzed the soil C/N/P stoichiometry and studied soil bacterial and archaeal diversity/abundance via high throughput sequencing and qPCR approaches. Our results show that soil P decoupled with N or C when below 3a?mg/kg but coupled with C and N when above 3a?mg/kg. Archaeal diversity and abundance were significantly higher in low AP (< 3a?mg/kg) soils than in high AP (>3a?mg/kg) soils, while bacterial were less changed. Compared with bacteria, archaea are more strongly related with soil stoichiometry (C:N, C:P, N:P), especially when AP was less than 3a?mg/kg. Taxonomic and functional composition analysis further confirmed that archaeal rather than bacterial taxonomic composition was significantly related with functional composition of microbial communities. Taken together, our results show that archaea are more important than bacteria in driving soil stoichiometry in phosphorus deficient habitats and suggest a niche differentiation of soil bacteria and archaea in regulating the soil C/N/P cycling in subtropical forests.","output":"Archaea is more important than bacteria in driving soil stoichiometry in phosphorus deficient habitats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare systems worldwide generate vast amounts of data from many different sources.

Its use for non-imaging data becomes feasible through different modern machine learning techniques, converting non-imaging data into images before inputting them into the CNN model. Considering also that healthcare providers do not solely use one data modality for their decisions, this approach opens the door for multi-input/mixed data models which use a combination of patient information, such as genomic, radiological, and clinical data, to train a hybrid deep learning model.

However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel cell-based luciferase complementation reporter assay to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. The assay is based on a lentiviral vector that co-expresses 3CLpro and two luciferase fragments linked together by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage results in a loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro results in 10-fold higher levels of luciferase activity. The luciferase reporter assay can easily distinguish true 3CLpro inhibition from cytotoxicity, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. Using the assay, we screened 32 small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Of these, only five exhibited significant inhibition of 3CLpro in cells: GC376, boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496.

Early clinical management with limited use of CPAP (3% of patients) was compared with a later clinical management strategy which had a higher proportion of CPAP use (15%). DESIGN: Retrospective case-controlled service evaluation for a single UK National Health Service (NHS) Trust during March-June 2020 designed and conducted solely to estimate the effects of current care. SETTING: The acute inpatient unit in Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a medium-sized English NHS Trust. PARTICIPANTS: 206 patients with antigen confirmed COVID-19 disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome admitted between 17 March 2020 and 3 April 2020 for the early group (controls), and between 10 April 2020 and 11 May 2020 for the late group (cases). Follow-up for all cases was until 11 June by which time all patients had a final outcome of death or discharge. Both groups were composed of 103 patients. Cases and controls were matched by age and sex. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome measure was the proportion of patients surviving at time t (time from the positive result of COVID-19 test to discharge/death date). The predictors were CPAP intervention, intubation, residence in care homes and comorbidities (renal, pulmonary, cardiac, hypertension and diabetes). A stratified Cox proportional hazard for clustered data (via generalised estimating equations) and model selection algorithms were employed to identify the effect of CPAP on patients' survival and the effect on gas exchange as measured by alveolar arterial (A-a) gradient and timing of CPAP treatment on CPAP patients' survival. RESULTS: CPAP was found to be significantly (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.40) associated with lower risk of death in patients with hospital stay equal to, or below 7 days. However, for longer hospitalisation CPAP was found to be associated with increased risk of death (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.12). When CPAP was initiated within 4 days of hospital admission, the survival probability was above 73% (95% CI 53% to 99%). In addition, lower A-a gradient was associated with lower risk of death in CPAP patients (HR 1.011, 95% CI 1.010 to 1.013). The selected model (best fit) was stratified by sex and clustered by case/control groups. The predictors were age, intubation, hypertension and the residency from care homes, which were found to be statistically significantly associated with patient's death/discharge. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP is a simple and cost-effective intervention. It has been established for care of other respiratory disorders but not for COVID-19 respiratory failure. This evaluation establishes that CPAP as a potentially viable treatment option for this group of patients during the first days of hospital admission. As yet there is limited availability of quantitative research on CPAP use for COVID-19. Whist this work is hampered by both the relatively small sample size and retrospective design (which reduced the ability to control potential confounders), it represents evidence of the significant benefit of early CPAP intervention. This evaluation should stimulate further research questions and larger study designs on the potential benefit of CPAP for COVID-19 infections.

Participants (N = 320, mean age = 35.11 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing alcohol use, sleep, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (June-August 2020) and retrospectively assessed the same health behaviors in the months prior to the pandemic. Insomnia severity increased, sleep quality decreased, and depressive symptoms increased for both caregivers and non-caregivers during the pandemic (p < 0.001). By contrast, alcohol consumption increased among caregivers only (p < 0.05). Further, increased alcohol use was associated with decreased sleep quality and increased insomnia symptoms among caregivers, but not non-caregivers. While additional longitudinal research is warranted in this population, our findings offer important insight on self-reported changes in alcohol consumption, sleep patterns, and mood among family caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Alcohol Use, Sleep, and Depression Among Family Caregivers in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals as well as disease-specific brain tumor organizations These organizations around the world exist to address unmet needs for patients and caregivers they serve The direct impact of the pandemic on these organizations constitutes significant collateral damage In order to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on brain tumor organizations, the International Brain Tumour Alliance (IBTA) carried out an international survey to identify organizational changes induced by the virus and approaches adopted to address challenges METHODS: A 37-question online survey consisting of categorical and qualitative questions was developed and circulated to 130 brain tumor organizations across the world Seventy-seven organizations from 22 countries completed the survey (59% return rate) Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to present the results RESULTS: Responses fell into the following 3 categories: (1) organizational characteristics, (2) impact of COVID-19 on services, and (3) COVID-19 impact on financial and human resources within organizations Although organizational characteristics varied, common concerns reported were activity disruption which impacted organizations' abilities to offer usual services and challenges to sustaining funding Both financial and human resources were stressed, but integral adaptations were made by organizations to preserve resources during the pandemic CONCLUSIONS: Although brain tumor organizations have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations quickly adjusted to this unprecedented global healthcare crisis Nimble reactions and flexibility have been vital to organization sustainability Innovative approaches are required to ensure organizations remain viable so that needs of brain tumor community at large are met","output":"The brain tumor not-for-profit and charity experience of COVID-19: reacting and adjusting to an unprecedented global pandemic in the 21st century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditionally, the prevention of cancer (and other chronic diseases) has been considered primarily linked to personal responsibility, for which interventions must be based on health education information enabling individuals to make knowledge-based decisions to improve their lifestyle.

It is very reliable in detecting artifacts associated with alveolar-interstitial syndrome - a common feature seen in patients with pneumonia, pulmonary edema and more recently, COVID-19. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of ED nurses to interpret point-of-care lung ultrasound artifacts suggestive of COVID-19 respiratory disease at the triage. Methods: Our single-center study prospectively evaluated all consecutive patients who were suspected of COVID-19 respiratory disease at the ED of St. Lukes Medical Center-Quezon City. Eligible patients underwent lung ultrasonography conducted by a trained ED nurse. The ultrasound scans were recorded, stored and interpreted by nurses as to the presence or absence of B- lines, C- lines and/or pleural effusion. These scans were then subsequently viewed and interpreted by an emergency medicine (EM) physician and then finally by a senior ED consultant who is an expert on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Results: A total of 382 patients were included in the study, which generated 3057 lung ultrasound scans for analysis. Nurse agreement in interpreting B-lines with the emergency physician and the POCUS expert were satisfactory yielding Cohens Kappa score of 0.845 (excellent agreement) and 0.781 (good agreement) respectively. On the other hand, nurse agreement in interpreting C-lines with the emergency physician and the POCUS expert were acceptable at a Kappa of 0.678 (good agreement) and 0.272 (fair agreement), respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that nurses who have been trained in the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound can reliably identify and interpret ultrasound artifacts most notably B- lines. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, nurse-performed lung ultrasonography can potentially provide a useful and expedient triage strategy for suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients presenting at the ED.","output":"75 Reliability of Nurse-Perfromed Lung Ultrasonography of Suspected COVID-19 Patients at the Emergency Department Traige a Single-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As social media platforms have become significant sources of information during the pandemic, a significant volume of both factual and inaccurate information related to the prevention of COVID-19 has been disseminated through social media. Thus, disparities in COVID-19 information verification across populations have the potential to promote the dissemination of misinformation among clustered groups of people with similar characteristics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the characteristics of social media users who obtained COVID-19 information through unofficial social media accounts, were (1) most likely to change their health behaviors according to web-based information and (2) were least likely to actively verify the accuracy of COVID-19 information, as these individuals may be susceptible to inaccurate prevention measures and exacerbate its transmission. METHODS: An online questionnaire consisting of 17 questions was disseminated by West China Hospital via its official online platforms, between May 18, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The questionnaire collected 14,509 adults' sociodemographic information, and included questions surveying Chinese netizens' knowledge about COVID-19, personal social media usage, health behavioral change tendencies, and cross-verification behaviors for web-based information during the pandemic. Multiple stepwise regression models were used to examine the relationships between social media use, behavior changes, and information cross-verification. RESULTS: Respondents who were most likely to change their health behaviors after obtaining web-based COVID-19 information from celebrities' sources had the following characteristics: females (P=0.004); age older than 50 years (P=0.009); those with a higher COVID-19 knowledge and health literacy(both P<0.05); nonhealthcare professionals (P=0.017); those with a higher frequency of searching on social media (P<0.001); those with better health conditions(P<0.001); and those reporting trust score rating of more than 3 for information released by celebrities on social media (P<0.05). Furthermore, among participants who were most likely to change their health behaviors according to social media information released by celebrities, women (P<0.001); living in a rural residence (P<0.05); those with self-reported medium health status and lower healthcare literacy(both P<0.05); those who less frequently sought COVID-19 information on social media (P<0.001); and those who reported a greater level of trust toward celebrities' social media accounts with a rating score greater than 1 (P<0.05) were associated with a lack of cross-verification information. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that governments, healthcare agencies, celebrities, and technicians should combine their efforts to decrease the risk of vulnerable groups that are inclined to change health behaviors according to web-based information but do not perform any fast-check verification of the accuracy of the unofficial information. More specifically, it is necessary to correct the falsehoods related to COVID-19 on social media, appropriately apply celebrities' star power, and increase Chinese netizens' awareness of information cross-verification and eHealth literacy to evaluate the veracity of web-based information.","output":"Do Chinese netizens cross-verify the accuracy of unofficial social media information before changing health behaviors during COVID-19?

We compared bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution of recorded cortical signals using subdural, epidural and endovascular arrays four weeks after implantation in sheep. We show that the quality of the signals (bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio) of the endovascular neural interface is not significantly different from conventional neural sensors. However, the spatial resolution depends on the array location and the frequency of recording. We also show that there is a direct correlation between the signal-noise-ratio and classification accuracy, and that decoding accuracy is comparable between electrode arrays.

We aim to utilize the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to determine whether prolonged chemoradiation (CRT) treatment time in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be compensated for by an increase in total radiation dose. MATERIALS/METHODS We identified 26,101 patients who were treated curatively with CRT using standard doses (59.4-66.6 Gy) and fractionation for stage III NSCLC between 2004-2017. Treatments were classified as non-prolonged or prolonged. The total number of days allowed for non-prolonged treatment for each dose/fractionation was calculated by adding number of fractions, weekend days (to accommodate any weekday start), and 2 additional days. Any treatment exceeding this number of days was prolonged. Multivariable Cox proportional regression was used to assess the association between specific doses and treatment durations and OS while adjusting for age, gender, race, comorbidity score, insurance status, facility type, urban/rural location, education, clinical T and N category. RESULTS Of 26,101 patients, 57% were male and the median age was 67. The most common T and N stage were T2 (31%) and N2 (64%), respectively. The majority of patients (62%) did not have prolonged treatment. For those who had prolonged treatment, the median prolongation was 4 days and survival was worse (HR 1.256, P = < 0.0001). Comparison of non-prolonged and prolonged treatment was then limited to two dose levels: 60 Gy and 66 Gy, both delivered in 2 Gy fractions (13,189 patients). Both doses resulted in similar survival for non-prolonged treatment (HR for 60 Gy non-prolonged: reference; HR for 66 Gy non-prolonged: 1.01, P = 0.633) and worse survival if treatment was prolonged (HR for 60 Gy prolonged: 1.294, P = < 0.0001; HR for 66 Gy prolonged: 1.216, P = < 0.0001). Direct comparison of the prolonged groups for 60 Gy and 66 Gy is tabulated below. For prolongation of 1-3 days, 66 Gy and 60 Gy were equivalent. If treatment was prolonged for 4 days or longer, survival was improved for higher total radiation dose. CONCLUSION Prolonged CRT in stage III NSCLC is associated with worse survival. Alteration of total dose should be considered for prolonged treatment time, especially as the number of missed days increases.","output":"Clinical Significance of Total Radiation Dose for Patients With Treatment Delays in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus has been responsible for several virus outbreaks since 2003, caused by SARSCoV-1, MERS-CoV, and currently SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), the causative agent of coronavirus disease in 2019 COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency because of its high virulence and mortality capacity This patent review aims to provide an overview of the patents that present possible treatments for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Areas covered: To treat SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, researchers have filed patents for a number of therapeutic agents Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3 CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments Expert opinion: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections If shown to be effective, these drugs may be extremely important in the current pandemic","output":"SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) treatment: a patent revie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using proprietary data from AngelList Talent, we study how individuals' job search and application behavior changed during the COVID downturn.

The objective of this prospective, observational study was to evaluate the degree of stress in medical students by measuring hormone levels during critical care classes. METHODS: Overall, 55 students (senior years of medical faculty) of both sexes were divided into 5-person teams. Demographic data and information on diagnosed diseases, stimulants used, and previous experience in the field of medical simulation were collected with a personal questionnaire. Before starting the scenario (T0), after the end of the scenario (T1), and 120 min thereafter (T2), stress level was measured. For this purpose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation were evaluated. In addition, saliva was collected to determine alpha-amylase activity and the concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin class A, cortisol, and testosterone. RESULTS: Among hemodynamic parameters, systolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher in T1 than in T0 and T2 time points (p < 0.05). Cortisol concentration was higher at T2 compared with T0 and T1. Alpha-amylase activity was highest at T1. Secretory immunoglobulin class A concentration was highest at T0, followed by T1 and then T2. These differences were not statistically significant. Testosterone concentration showed significantly higher values at T2 compared with T0 and T1 (p < 0.05).

There has not been any systematic empirical study of the dynamics of emerging coordination behaviour and knowledge transfer process during a disease outbreak. In this paper, we first introduce our approach for the analysis of multi-agency intervention during a disease outbreak using the study of social networks. Using social networks and its analytic framework, we explore questions such as: How does the multi-agency coordination emerge for supporting the complex knowledge transfer process during different phases of disease outbreak? How effective are these formal and informal coordination mechanisms in achieving a robust outcome in response coordination through effective knowledge transfer process during the outbreak? What are the key lessons learned by studying the emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during past disease outbreak in improving the multi-agency preparedness for dealing with future outbreaks? The discussion is supported by a qualitative study of the implementation of the results of the analysis. We reveal that profound understanding of social network behaviour and emerging coordination concepts are pivotal to the optimisation of knowledge transfer process which is a prerequisite for successful outbreak intervention.

Our objective was to derive and internally validate a clinical risk score to predict death among patients awaiting major cardiac surgery. METHODS: We used the CorHealth Ontario Registry and linked ICES health administrative databases with information on all Ontario residents to identify patients aged 18 years or more who were referred for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valvular procedures, combined CABG-valvular procedures or thoracic aorta procedures between Oct. 1, 2008, and Sept. 30, 2019. We used a hybrid modelling approach with the random forest method for initial variable selection, followed by backward stepwise logistic regression modelling for clinical interpretability and parsimony. We internally validated the logistic regression model, termed the CardiOttawa Waitlist Mortality Score, using 200 bootstraps. RESULTS: Of the 112 266 patients referred for cardiac surgery, 269 (0.2%) died while awaiting surgery (118/72 366 [0.2%] isolated CABG, 81/24 461 [0.3%] valvular procedures, 63/12 046 [0.5%] combined CABG-valvular procedures and 7/3393 [0.2%] thoracic aorta procedures).

The model discriminated (C-statistic 0.76 [optimism-corrected 0.73]). It calibrated well in the overall cohort (Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.2) and across surgery types. INTERPRETATION: The CardiOttawa Waitlist Mortality Score is a simple clinical risk model that predicts the likelihood of death while awaiting cardiac surgery.

Although viral infection is known to trigger inflammatory processes contributing to tissue injury and organ failure, it is unclear whether direct viral damage is needed to sustain cellular injury. An understanding of pathogenic mechanisms has been handicapped by the absence of optimized methods to visualize the presence and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in damaged tissues. METHODS: We first developed a positive control cell line (Vero E6) to validate SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We then evaluated multiple organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, brain, intestines, lymph nodes and spleen) from fourteen COVID-19 autopsy cases using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the spike and the nucleoprotein proteins, and RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA ISH) for the spike protein mRNA. Tissue detection assays were compared with quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based detection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was histologically detected in the Vero E6 positive cell line control, 1 of 14 (7%) lungs, and none (0%) of the other 59 organs. There was perfect concordance between the IHC and RNA ISH results. qPCR confirmed high viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 ISH-positive lung tissue, and absent or low viral load in all ISH-negative tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who die of COVID-19-related organ failure, SARS-CoV-2 is largely not detectable using tissue-based assays. Even in lungs showing widespread injury, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA or proteins were detected in only a small minority of cases. This observation supports the concept that viral infection is primarily a trigger for multiple organ pathogenic pro-inflammatory responses.

Methods: In total, 60 patients with high-grade chronic rhinosinusitis (Lund-Mackay score 12 or greater) treated by ESS were randomized into two groups: the control group (Group C) or the TXA group (Group T). Each group included 30 patients. Patients in Group T received intravenous TXA, and those in Group C received normal saline. The Boezaart grading scale (BS) score was assessed as the primary outcome. Total blood loss (TBL), whole blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis were assessed by Sonoclot analysis, and complications were recorded and compared between the groups. Result: A significant difference was found in the BS score between Group T and Group C [2.02 (1.88-2.05) vs. 2.27 (2.13-2.41), P = 0.011].

Conditions wherein people deviated from the physical distancing measures were assessed by means of an open-ended question. HAPA determinants were assessed in a quantitative way. RESULTS: Half of the sample reported to deviate from the measures. Further, deviation from the measures was associated with each determinant outlined by the HAPA. Findings highlight that many people deviated from the measures because of their need for social contact. The majority of the people who deviated from the measures stated that they carefully weighed the risks of their behavior.

After a delay of 4 to 5 days, all patients underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy and reconstruction with the prepared gastric conduit (Ivor-Lewis). Mucosal oxygen saturation (MOS, sulfur dioxide in %) was quantitatively measured from the endoluminal side in well-defined areas of the antrum, corpus, and fundus using a tissue spectrometer located at the tip of a microprobe (LEA, Medizintechnik, Giessen, Germany). Under general anesthesia, sulfur dioxide measurement I was taken before, and measurement II after laparoscopic gastric mobilization; measurement III was done before esophagectomy and reconstruction 4 to 5 days later. RESULTS Before laparoscopic mobilization of the stomach the median MOS of the fundus was 72% (range, 49% to 86%). The MOS significantly decreased after devascularization of the stomach (median MOS, 38%; range, 9% to 86%). After 4 to 5 days, MOS almost recovered to values observed before gastric mobilization (median MOS, 62%; range, 48% to 85%).

This study was conducted among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Hospital La Mancha Centro between March 5 and 25, 2020. Information on influenza vaccination was extracted from electronic medical records. We used a multivariate logistic regression to explore the association between influenza vaccination and mortality from COVID and other risk factors. Results: 410 patients were included. Influenza vaccine had no effect among COVID-19 hospitalized patients [OR: 1.55 (95%CI: 0.96 C 2.48; p=0.071)].

Genetic background of the host seems to be partly responsible for severe phenotype and genes related to innate immune response seem critical host determinants. The C9orf72 gene has a role in vesicular trafficking, autophagy regulation and lysosome functions, is highly expressed in myeloid cells and is involved in immune functions, regulating the lysosomal degradation of mediators of innate immunity. A large non-coding hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in this gene is the main genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both characterized by neuroinflammation and high systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines, while HREs of intermediate length, although rare, are more frequent in autoimmune disorders. C9orf72 full mutation results in haploinsufficiency and intermediate HREs seem to modulate gene expression as well and impair autophagy. Herein, we sought to explore whether intermediate HREs in C9orf72 may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Although we found intermediate HREs in only a small portion of 240 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the magnitude of risk for requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation conferred by harboring intermediate repeats >10 units in at least one C9orf72 allele was more than twice respect to having shorter expansions, when adjusted for age (odds ratio (OR) 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04C5.37, p = 0.040). The association between intermediate repeats >10 units and more severe clinical outcome (p = 0.025) was also validated in an independent cohort of 201 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Clones were generated from a approximately 22 kb dsRNA purified from lymphoid organ total RNA of GAV-infected prawns. The region contains a single gene comprising two long overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, of 4060 and 2646 amino acids, respectively. The ORFs are structurally related to the ORF1a and ORF1ab polyproteins of coronaviruses and arteriviruses. The 99 nt overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b contains a putative AAAUUUU 'slippery' sequence associated with -1 ribosomal frameshifting. A 131 nt stem-loop with the potential to form a complex pseudoknot resides 3 nt downstream of this sequence. Although different to the G/UUUAAAC frameshift sites and 'H-type' pseudoknots of nidoviruses, in vitro transcription/translation analysis demonstrated that the GAV element also facilitates read-through of the ORF1a/1b junction. As in coronaviruses, GAV ORF1a encodes a 3C-like cysteine protease domain located between two hydrophobic regions. However, its sequence suggests some structural relationship to the chymotrypsin-like serine proteases of arteriviruses. ORF1b encodes homologues of the 'SDD' polymerase, which among (+)-RNA viruses is unique to nidoviruses, as well as metal-ion-binding and helicase domains.

A retrospective study was conducted in 275 COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai public health clinical center. The clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with different T lymphocyte phenotypes and those who were and were not treated with T&#945;1 were compared. Among the 275 patients, 137 (49.8%) were males, and the median age was 51 years [interquartile range (IQR): 37-64]. A total of 126 patients received T&#945;1 therapy and 149 patients did not. There were 158 (57.5%) patients with normal baseline CD4 counts (median:631/L, IQR: 501~762) and 117 patients (42.5%) with decreased baseline CD4 counts (median:271/L, IQR: 201~335). In those with decreased baseline CD4 counts, more patients were older (p<0.001), presented as critically ill (p=0.032) and had hypertension (p=0.008) compared with those with normal CD4 counts.

Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing.

BODY: In this white paper, we describe CMR protocols of 30 min or shorter duration with routine techniques with or without stress perfusion, plus specific approaches in patient and scanner room preparation for efficiency. Minimum requirements for the scanner gradient system, coil hardware and pulse sequences are detailed. Recent advances such as quantitative myocardial mapping and other add-on acquisitions can be incorporated into the proposed protocols without significant extension of scan duration for most patients.

Performance on the cognitive tests and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were analyzed by contrasting various classroom design conditions.

In recent years, there has been an increasing gathering of biological data for decision support systems in the diagnosis (e.g. histology imaging, next-generation sequencing technologies data, clinical information, etc.). Using all these sources to design integrative classification approaches may improve the final diagnosis of a patient, in the same way that doctors can use multiple types of screenings to reach a final decision on the diagnosis. In this work, we present a late fusion classification model using histology and RNA-Seq data for adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma and healthy lung tissue. RESULTS: The classification model improves results over using each source of information separately, being able to reduce the diagnosis error rate up to a 64% over the isolate histology classifier and a 24% over the isolate gene expression classifier, reaching a mean F1-Score of 95.19% and a mean AUC of 0.991. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a classification model using a late fusion methodology can considerably help clinicians in the diagnosis between the aforementioned lung cancer cancer subtypes over using each source of information separately.

The epidermis is heavily colonized by commensal bacterial organisms that help protect against pathogenic bacteria. The highly regulated and dynamic interaction between the epidermis and commensals involves the hosts production of nutritional factors promoting bacterial growth together to chemical and immunological bacterial inhibitors. Signal trafficking ensures the systems homeostasis; conditions that favor colonization by pathogens frequently foster commensal growth, thereby increasing the bacterial population size and inducing the skins antibacterial response, eliminating the pathogens and re-establishing the normal density of commensals. The microecological conditions of the epidermis favors Gram-positive organisms and are unsuitable for long-term Gram-negative colonization. However, the epidermis acts as the most important host-to-host transmission platform for bacteria, including those that colonize human mucous membranes. Bacteria are frequently shared by relatives, partners, and coworkers. The epidermal bacterial transmission platform of healthcare workers and visitors can contaminate hospitalized patients, eventually contributing to cross-infections. Epidermal transmission occurs mostly via the hands and particularly through fingers. The three-dimensional physical structure of the epidermis, particularly the fingertips, which have frictional ridges, multiplies the possibilities for bacterial adhesion and release. Research into the biology of bacterial transmission via the hands is still in its infancy; however, tribology, the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion, including friction, wear and lubrication, will certainly be an important part of it. Experiments on finger-to-finger transmission of microorganisms have shown significant interindividual differences in the ability to transmit microorganisms, presumably due to genetics, age, sex, and the gland density, which determines the physical, chemical, adhesive, nutritional, and immunological status of the epidermal surface.

Home isolation implies a notable physical deconditioning. Telerehabilitation methods have reported positive experiences, and we propose to study in affected patients of COVID-19, due to the general house confinement of the entire Spanish population. METHODS: Patients will be recruited in the regions of Andalusia, Murcia, and Valencia (Spain). Patients will remain confined to their homes, and there, they will carry out their assigned exercise program, which will be controlled telematically. Evaluators will attend to carry out all measurements at the beginning, during, and end of the study, telematically controlled. The patients will be randomly divided into three groups, two of them will perform a home exercise program (breathing exercises or non-specific exercises for muscle toning) and the third group will perform sedentary activities, using mental activation techniques, and will act as a sham group. We will evaluate respiratory variables and other variables of the physical state through physical tests, effort, and perceived fatigue. The data will be statistically analyzed, and the hypotheses will be tested between the groups, using the SPSS software, v.24, considering a 95% confidence interval. DISCUSSION: We will analyze the results, in terms of the level of fatigue and perceived exertion, physical health, and maintenance of respiratory activity of two types of exercise programs, toning and respiratory, applied in patients affected by COVID-19 during the period of home confinement. We intend to investigate a field not previously studied, such as the repercussion of carrying out a toning and respiratory exercise program in these patients, in historical circumstances that no one had previously observed in Spain, since the general population has never been forced to remain confined in their homes, due to a pandemic infection, by a coronavirus (COVID-19).

A sizable fraction of vaccine-H1+H3 CR s-mAbs recognized with high affinity the sulfated glycans, in particular sulfated type 2 N-acetyllactosamine (Gal1-4GalNAc), which is found on egg-produced proteins and thus unlikely to contribute to protection against influenza infection in humans. Antibodies against sulfated glycans in egg-produced vaccine had been identified in animals but were not previously characterized in humans. Collectively, our results provide a quantitative basis for how repeated exposure to split influenza vaccine correlates with unintended focusing of serum antibody responses to non-HA antigens that may result in suboptimal immunity against influenza.","output":"Influenza vaccination in the elderly boosts antibodies against conserved viral proteins and egg-produced glycans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We examine the role of learning-family conflicts for the relation between commuting strain and health in a sample of medical university students. The first goal of the study was to investigate the mediating role of learning-family conflicts. The second goal was to extend the temporal view on relations between study variables. Therefore, we differentiated long-term systematic change among variables over a period of two-years from a dynamic perspective with repeated commuting events on the individual level of analyses. METHODS: We applied a multilevel research design and collected survey data from 128 medical students on three points in time (N = 339 measurement points). Participants informed about commuting strain, learning-family conflicts, somatic symptoms, as well as commuting distance and time. RESULTS: Bayesian multilevel analyses showed that results differed with regard to level of analysis: while learning-family conflicts mediated the relation between commuting strain and somatic symptoms on a systematic aggregation-level perspective of analysis (indirect effect estimate(between) = 0.13, SE = .05, 95% CI [0.05; ), Evidence Ratio = 250.57), this was not the case on the dynamic event perspective (indirect effect estimate(within) = 0.00, SE = 0.00, 95% CI [? 0.01; ), Evidence Ratio = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that learning-family conflicts explain why commuting may have unfavorable effects on health for medical students. We also showed that it is the long-term commuting experience that is related to health complaints and not the single commuting event. This means that short-term deviations from general levels of commuting strain do not cause somatic symptoms, but general high levels of commuting strain do instead.","output":"A three-wave longitudinal study on the relation between commuting strain and somatic symptoms in university students: exploring the role of learning-family conflicts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online social media platforms are turning into the prime source of news and narratives about worldwide events.

Several prediction models have been developed to explore the relationship between patients' covariates and survival. However, the high-dimensional genomic features limit the prediction performance of the survival model. Thus, an accurate and reliable prediction model is necessary for survival analysis using high-dimensional genomic data. RESULTS In this study, we proposed an improved survival prediction model based on XGBoost framework called XGBLC, which used Lasso-Cox to enhance the ability to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. The novel first and second order gradient statistics of Lasso-Cox were defined to construct the loss function of XGBLC. We extensively tested our XGBLC algorithm on both simulated and real world datasets, and estimated the performance of models with 5-fold cross-validation. Based on 20 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XGBLC outperforms five state-of-the-art survival methods in terms of C-index, Brier score and AUC. The results show that XGBLC still keeps good accuracy and robustness by comparing the performance on the simulated datasets with different scales. The developed prediction model would be beneficial for physicians to understand the effects of patient's genomic characteristics on survival and make personalized treatment decisions.

Methods: The literature related to the above topic was reviewed including papers that analysed the connections, actions, interactions, consequences and occasionally suggestions for rational interventions. Results/Conclusion: Severe broncho-alveolar inflammation seems to be caused, at least in part, by upregulation of the KKS that increases plasma and/or local tissue concentrations of bradykinin (BK) in patients with COVID-19 infection. Besides KKS activation, suppression of ACE activity results in decreased bradykinin degradation, and these changes in concert can lead to excessive BK B1 and B2 receptor (BKB1R/BKB2R) activation. Aminopeptidase P (APP), and carboxypeptidase N also degrade bradykinin, but their protein expression and activity are unclear in COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, ACE2 expression is upregulated in patients with COVID-19 infection, so ACE2 activity is unlikely to be decreased despite blockade of part of ACE2 by the virus for entry into the cells. ACE2 cleaves lys-des-arginine9BK and arg-des-arginine9BK, the active metabolites of bradykinin, which stimulate the BKB1R receptor. Stimulation of BKB1R/BKB2R can exacerbate the pulmonary inflammatory response by causing vascular leakage and edema, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm and stimulation of pain afferent nerves. Despite all uncertainties, it seems rational to treat comorbid COVID patients with serious respiratory distress syndrome with ARBs instead of high-dose ACE inhibitor (ACEi) that will further decrease bradykinin degradation and enhance BKB1R/BKB2R activation, but ACEi may not be contraindicated in patients with mild pulmonary symptoms.","output":"High-dose ACEi might be harmful in COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory distress syndrome by leading to excessive bradykinin receptor activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare, with an estimated incidence of 3 58 per 100 000 live births in the UK and should be suspected in any newborn with fever and bacterial culture-negative sepsis We describe a case of a previously well full-term male neonate who presented with persistent fever and elevated ferritin level that was carried out during the era of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of SARS-CoV-2 panel investigations Despite the initial negative HSV serology, HSV-1 PCR from a scalp lesion returned positive He made a full recovery after acyclovir therapy This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical index of suspicion of HSV infection in any febrile neonate even with absence of maternal history and negative serology, particularly if associated with hyperferritinaemia We also address the challenge of interpreting inflammatory biomarkers results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates","output":"Prolonged fever and hyperferritinaemia: a puzzling diagnosis of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Src-family kinases (SFKs), such as c-Src, Lyn and Fyn, belong to non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases and play key roles in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. SFKs are anchored to the plasma membrane, Golgi membranes and lysosomal membranes through lipid modifications. Although the functions of SFKs being localized to the plasma membrane are intensively studied, those of SFKs being localized to organelle membranes are poorly understood. Here, we show that, among SFKs, c-Src in particular is involved in a decrease in the amount of LC3-II. c-Src and non-palmitoylated Lyn [Lyn(C3S) (cysteine-3a?a??a?serine-3)], which are localized onto lysosomes, decrease the amount of LC3-II and treatment with SFK inhibitors increases the amount of LC3-II, suggesting the importance of SFKs' lysosomal localization for a change of autophagic flux in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Colocalization of LC3-II with the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP1 shows that lysosome-localized SFKs promote the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Lysosome-localized SFKs play a positive role in the maintenance of cell viability under starvation conditions, which is further supported by knockdown of c-Src.

Stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1? and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B p65 and I&#954;B&#945;, and I&#954;B&#945; degradation. DNA binding of NF-&#954;B p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in inhibition of spike glycoprotein S1-induced NF-&#954;B activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment, produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1? and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1? production.

A total of 7148 pregnant women with complete information were included in the final analysis. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for analyzing the association of COVID-19 pandemic with FT4 levels and isolated hypothyroxinemia. RESULTS: We found a decreased maternal FT4 level during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in first and second trimesters ( = ?0. 131, 95%CI = ?0.257,?0.006p = 0.040) and in first trimester ( = ?0. 0.176, 95%CI = ?0.326,?0.026p = 0.022) when adjusting for 25 (OH) vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate and ferritin and gestational days, maternal socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions. The status of pandemic increased the risks of isolated hypothyroxinemia in first and second trimesters (OR = 1.547, 95%CI = 1.251,1.913, p < 0.001) and first trimester (OR = 1.651, 95%CI = 1.289,2.114, p < 0.001) when adjusting for the covariates. However, these associations disappeared in the women with positive TPOAb (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found associations between daily reported new case of COVID-19 and maternal FT4 for single-day lag1, lag3 and multi-day lag01 and lag04 when adjusting for the covariates (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mass confinement as a primary community control strategy may have a significant cost to public health resources. Access to health service systems and adequate medical resources should be improved for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The association between COVID-19 pandemic and maternal isolated hypothyroxinemia in first and second trimesters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognizing marked limitations of global health law in the COVID-19 pandemic, a rising number of states are supporting the development of a new pandemic treaty.

The survey included 26 questions distributed to University staff members across Egypt members of the Egyptian College of Rheumatology (ECR). It takes 5-10 min to fill out. The practice setting of participating rheumatologists included University Teaching Hospitals that are the main rheumatology and clinical immunology service providers for adults and children RD patients.

However, the communities of practice in question show uneasy or under-developed collaborations, due to a variety of factors.

Based on complementary perspectives on health and knowledge, this overview provides an inter- and trans-disciplinary analysis of the role of the framing of ? nature ? in One Health discourses as a barrier or a facilitator to collaboration, as revealed by the scientific literature. We find that the lack of reflection by scientists about the framing under which they operate appears as a major factor of misunderstanding between disciplines, and a barrier for inter- and trans-disciplinary solutions to improve management of health risks and benefits. Hence, to build such solutions, framing will have to be a conscious and repeated step in the process, acknowledging and explaining the diversity of viewpoints and values. The interdisciplinary dialogues inherent in this process promote translation between scientific domains, policy-makers and citizens, with a critical but pluralistic recourse to various framings of health risks and benefits associated with nature, and a deep awareness of their practical and ethical consequences.","output":"The good, the bad and the ugly: framing debates on nature in a One Health community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identification of disease-related protein-protein interactions (PPIs) creates objective conditions for their pharmacological modulation.

This has created a dire situation that has led to food insecurity, water shortages, uncontrolled outbreaks of infectious disease and further failings within the healthcare system. This has greatly impacted the practice of emergency medicine (EM), and is now compounded by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the current state of emergency and disaster medicine in Yemen, followed by unstructured qualitative interviews with EM workers, performed by either direct discussion or via phone calls, to capture their lived experience, observations on and perceptions of the challenges facing EM in Yemen. We summarize and present our findings in this paper. RESULTS: Emergency medical services (EMS) in Yemen are severely depleted. Across the country as a whole, there are only 10 healthcare workers for every 10,000 people C less than half of the WHO benchmark for basic health coverage C and only five physicians, less than one third the world average; 18% of the countrys 333 districts have no qualified physicians at all. Ambulances and basic medical equipment are in short supply. As a result of the ongoing war, only 50% of the 5056 pre-war hospitals and health facilities are functional. In June 2020, Yemen recorded a 27% mortality rate of Yemenis who were confirmed to have COVID-19, more than five times the global average and among the highest in the world at that time. CONCLUSION: In recent years, serious efforts to develop an advanced EM presence in Yemen and cultivate improvements in EMS have been stymied or have failed outright due to the ongoing challenges.

We have devised an internally standardized flow cytometry approach that can identify parallel inflammatory alveolar macrophage phenotypes in both the mouse and human lungs. In mice, lung innate immune cell alterations during endotoxin challenge, influenza virus infection, and in two genetic models of chronic obstructive lung disease could be segregated based on the presence or absence of CD11b alveolar macrophage upregulation and lung eosinophilia. Additionally, heightened alveolar macrophage CD11b expression was a novel feature of acute lung exacerbations in the SHIP-1(?/?) model of chronic obstructive lung disease, and anti-CD11b antibody administration selectively blocked inflammatory CD11b(pos) but not homeostatic CD11b(neg) alveolar macrophages in vivo. The identification of analogous profiles in respiratory disease patients highlights this approach as a translational avenue for lung disease endotyping and suggests that heterogeneous innate immune cell phenotypes are an underappreciated component of the human lung disease microenvironment.

Mortality estimates among cancer patients vary and are influenced by numerous factors including cancer type, treatment, disease stage, and patient demographics. To date, attempts to explore these associations have been limited by small cohorts. Methods: Here, we present a meta-analysis of data available through the Reboot: COVID-Cancer Project, a living and freely available resource that includes published clinical studies that report outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19. Studies were identified using targeted search queries in PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and the SSRN eLibrary, followed by rule-based approaches and extensive manual validation and data extraction. The data is updated monthly and can be explored through an interactive dashboard as well as downloaded. Case fatality rates (CFR;the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases during the study period) were calculated using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity and sample size bias was assessed using the Egger regression test. Results: As of December 18, 2020, the resource contained 225 publications comprising 21,839 cancer patients with COVID-19. Of these, there was sufficient sample size to quantify CFRs for 22 cancer types across 19,147 patients from 109 publications. The pooled CFR among all cancer patients was 27% (95% CI: 25-30%). For solid tumors and hematological malignancies, the CFRs were 23% (95% CI: 20-25%) and 30% (95% CI: 27-33%), respectively. Within solid tumors, patients with lung (CFR: 32%, 95% CI: 27-36%), prostate (CFR: 30%, 95% CI: 17-43%), and central nervous system (CFR: 27%, 95% CI: 18-36%) malignancies had relatively high CFRs, whereas patients with breast (CFR: 10%, 95% CI: 7-14%) and thyroid (CFR: 5%, 95% CI: 1-11%) malignancies had relatively low CFRs. Among patients with hematological malignancies, CFRs ranged from 10% (95% CI: 3-18%) in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to 39% (95% CI: 20-57%) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Discussion: We observed significant heterogeneity of COVID-19 CFRs between cancer subtypes. This may in part reflect differences in patient demographics, treatment history, or disease state.

Important questions to be answered regarding vaccines are efficacy, safety, and whether antibodies are protective when used in different communities. This study aimed to determine seroconversion rates of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthcare workers in a hospital and short-term adverse events due to the vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study carried out in Cukurova University, Turkey, comprised 282 healthcare workers who received two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administered in two 3 g doses, 28 days apart. On day 28 after the second dose, anti-S-RBD IgG and total anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by using in vitro chemiluminescence immunoassay method. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 39.0610.65 (min 21; max 65) with 43.6% males and 56.4% females. On day 28 after the second dose, the seroconversion rates were found to be 92.9% for total anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG and 15.2% for IgM and 98.2% for anti-S-RBD IgG antibodies and having natural COVID-19 prior to vaccination, age and comorbidity were found to be significant factors for immunogenicity. The incidence of at least one adverse event was found as 29.8% after the first dose and 24.1% after the second dose, with the most common events being pain at the injection site, weakness, fatigue and headache. CONCLUSION: On day 28 after the second dose of 3 ?g of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration, a high rate of seroconversion was observed with no serious adverse event. Prior natural COVID-19 history, age and comorbidity were significant contributors to the formation of a strong immune response.

METHODS: Using umbrella review methodology, we identified systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of 14 potentially low-value practices in adults with acute TBI. We present data on methodological quality (AMSTAR-2), reported effect sizes and credibility of evidence (I to IV). RESULTS: The only clinical practice with evidence of benefit was therapeutic hypothermia (credibility of evidence II to IV). However, the most recent meta-analysis on hypothermia based on high-quality trials suggested harm (credibility of evidence IV). Meta-analyses on platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelet therapy were all consistent with harm but were statistically non-significant. For the following practices, effect estimates were consistently close to the null: CT in adults with mild TBI who are low-risk on a validated clinical decision rule; repeat CT in adults with mild TBI on anticoagulant therapy with no clinical deterioration; antibiotic prophylaxis for external ventricular drain placement; and decompressive craniectomy for refractory intracranial hypertension.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 115 isolates of NIs-causing P. aeruginosa were collected from NIs. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations. Biofilm formation was tested on 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (MTP). CRPA isolates were genotyped using multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The most resistance and susceptibility rates were observed to amikacin (70.6%) and colistin (96.1%), respectively. Colistin and meropenem were the most active antimicrobial agents in VAP, SSI, and BSI. While, colistin and cefepime were the most active in UTIs. In total, 52.2% (n = 60/115) of P. aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant, of which 95.0%, 55.0%, and 5.0% were multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pandrug-resistant, respectively. There was a significant association between resistance to carbapenem and resistance to other antibiotics except for piperacillin/tazobactam. The biofilm production of CRPA isolates was 95.0%, of which 23.3% were strong biofilm producers. Based on MLVA, there were 34 different types of CRPA isolates classified into three main clusters and 5 sub clusters.

It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DPP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found. The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.","output":"Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 levels and DPP4 gene polymorphisms in patients with COVID-19.

The boosting of circulating antibodies which can be transferred to the foetus would offer immune protection against the virus and ultimately the disease. Since non-human primates (NHPs) have similar reproductive anatomy, physiology, and antibody architecture and kinetics to humans, we utilized this preclinical species to evaluate maternal immunization (MI) using an RSV F subunit vaccine. Three species of NHPs known for their ability to be infected with human RSV in experimental challenge studies were tested for RSV-specific antibodies. African green monkeys had the highest overall antibody levels of the old-world monkeys evaluated and they gave birth to offspring with anti-RSV titers that were proportional to their mother. These higher overall antibody levels are associated with greater durability found in their offspring. Immunization of RSV seropositive AGMs during late pregnancy boosts RSV titers, which consequentially results in significantly higher titers in the vaccinated new-borns compared to the new-borns of unvaccinated mothers. These findings, accomplished in small treatment group sizes, demonstrate a model that provides an efficient, resource sparing and translatable preclinical in vivo system for evaluating vaccine candidates for maternal immunization.","output":"Transplacental Antibody Transfer of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Specific IgG in Non-Human Primate Mother-Infant Pairs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unfolding COVID-19 emergency in India not only points to the explosive speed with which SARS-CoV-2 can spread in populations if unchecked, but also to the gross misreading of the status of the pandemic when decisions to reopen the economy were made in March this year.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate risk of cardiovascular events among adults aged sixty-five and older with depression who were prescribed amphetamines. METHODS We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study utilizing the TriNetx database and statistical software. The 1:1 propensity score matching technique was performed using logistic regression to balance the baseline characteristics of the population. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of depression and age sixty-five years and older. We excluded individuals with an adverse cardiovascular event or diagnosis of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prior to enrollment. Individuals were followed from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. Those prescribed an amphetamine were considered exposed and others served as controls. We used descriptive statistics and calculated risk ratios to assess the relationship between amphetamine prescriptions and cardiovascular events in these cohorts. RESULTS There were 4,434 included in the exposed cohort and 4,434 matched controls in the unexposed group. The cohort exposed to amphetamines had higher HDL along with lower LDL, total cholesterol, hemoglobin A1C, systolic blood pressure, and BMI than the control group, but increased risk of cardiovascular events (Risk Ratio: 8.9; 95% Confidence Interval: 6.39,12.48). CONCLUSIONS Amphetamines offer potential benefits to people with depression, however, these data suggest increased risk of cardiovascular events among older individuals.

Methods: We considered studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs as well as interventional or observational studies correlating pain scores with measures derived from wearable devices. A search was also performed on studies that investigated physical activity and physiometric signals among patients with pain. Results: Few studies have assessed the possibility of incorporating wearable devices as objective tools for contextualizing pain and physical function in free-living environments. Of the studies that have been conducted, most focus solely on physical activity and functional outcomes as measured by a wearable accelerometer. Several studies report promising correlations between pain scores and signals derived from wearable devices, objectively measured physical activity, and physical function. In addition, there is a known association between physiologic signals that can be measured by wearable devices and pain, though studies using wearable devices to measure these signals and associate them with pain in free-living environments are limited. Conclusion: There exists a great opportunity to study the complex interplay between physiometric signals, physical function, and pain in a real-time fashion in free-living environments. The literature supports the hypothesis that wearable devices can be used to develop reproducible biosignals that correlate with pain. The combination of wearable devices and EMA will likely lead to the development of clinically meaningful endpoints that will transform how we understand and treat pain patients.","output":"Wearable Devices: Current Status and Opportunities in Pain Assessment and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020, students of all education levels are pushed to study at home via online classes Schools, universities and other educational institutes have to make sure that their students can keep receiving knowledge and information based on the indicators set by the curriculum The same thing also occurs at the English Education Department of Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, Indonesia This article presents the results of a two-cycle action research project conducted in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, through an online learning platform using Zoom meeting In this study, eight undergraduate students participated in the online intervention class to apply genre-based visualization metacognitive strategy A total of six academic texts of the explanation genre were taken from TOEFL tests and used in both cycles In the online intervention class, students generated visual imagery of the academic texts, built up their knowledge of the text genres in the online discussions, and individually drew visual representations of the explanatory texts The images drawn by the students were taken for the qualitative analysis, and the tests given to the students were analyzed quantitatively Both data are used to find out their improvement in reading comprehension The findings of this study revealed a remarkable contribution of genre-based visualization for improving students' comprehension of academic texts of the explanation genre at TOEFL level, particularly through online learning during the pandemic ? 2021, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia All rights reserved","output":"Genre-based visualization through an online teaching platform: A strategy to engage with academic texts during the covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled widespread shortages of personal protective equipment including N95 respirators. Several centers are developing reusable stop-gap respirators as alternatives to disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies, using techniques such as 3D-printing, silicone moulding and plastic extrusion. Effective sealing of the mask, combined with respiratory filters should achieve 95% or greater filtration of particles less than 1um. Quantitative fit-testing (QNFT) data from these stop-gap devices has not been published to date. Our team developed one such device, the \\"SSM\\", and evaluated it using QNFT. METHODS: Device prototypes were iteratively evaluated for comfort, breathability and communication, by team members wearing them for 15-30min. The fit and seal were assessed by positive and negative pressure user seal checks. The final design was then formally tested by QNFT, according to CSA standard Z94.4-18 in 40 volunteer healthcare providers. An overall fit-factor >100 is the passing threshold. Volunteers were also tested by QNFT on disposable N95 masks which had passed qualitative fit testing (QLFT) by institutional Occupational Health and Safety Department. RESULTS: The SSM scored 3.5/5 and 4/5 for comfort and breathability. The median overall harmonic mean fit-factors of disposable N95 and SSM were 137.9 and 6316.7 respectively. SSM scored significantly higher than disposable respirators in fit-test runs and overall fit-factors (p <0.0001). Overall passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators on QNFT were 65% and 100%. During dynamic runs, passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators were 68.1% and 99.4%; harmonic means were 73.7 and 1643.

This review discusses current evidence relating to the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and immunological effects of e-cigarettes. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of e-cigarettes by healthy adults has been shown to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness, as well as resistance to air flow in lungs. Inhalation of e-cigarette aerosol has been shown to elicit immune responses and increase the production of immunomodulatory cytokines in young tobacco-na?ve individuals. In animal models, long-term exposure to e-cigarettes leads to marked changes in lung architecture, dysregulation of immune genes, and low-grade inflammation. Exposure to e-cigarette aerosols in mice has been shown to induce DNA damage, inhibit DNA repair, and promote carcinogenesis. Chronic exposure to e-cigarettes has also been reported to result in the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the lung and dysregulation of lipid metabolism and transport in mice. Although, the genotoxic and inflammatory effects of e-cigarettes are milder than those of combustible cigarettes, some of the cardiorespiratory effects of the two insults are comparable. The toxicity of e-cigarettes has been variably linked to nicotine, as well as other e-cigarette constituents, operating conditions, and use patterns. SUMMARY: The use of e-cigarettes in humans is associated with significant adverse cardiorespiratory and immunological changes.

Understanding the clinical course, potential risk factors for severe infection and excess mortality, is essential to improve patient outcomes. We previously presented preliminary results from 156 SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients from Guy's Cancer Center, which suggested that increased COVID-19 mortality was associated with a diagnosis of cancer for over 2 years, Asian ethnicity and being on palliative treatment. Herein, we present an updated analysis using data from Guy's Cancer Centre and a partner Hospital Trust (King's College Hospital), with an increased number of patients and an extended follow up. Methods: We performed an analysis of all cancer patients who had a positive RT-PCR nasal/throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection at our Centers between 29th February and 31st July 2020. Associations between patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory investigations with COVID-19 severity and mortality, were assessed using Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 306 SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients were included in the analysis with a median follow up of 134 days (IQR 32-156). 184 (60%) were male and 217 (71%) were aged over 60 (mean age: 66). The most common malignancies were haematological (38%) and urological-gynaecological (20%). 218 (71%) had mild/moderate COVID-19 and 88 (29%) had severe disease. The overall COVID-related mortality rate was 24%;19% in solid and 32% in haematological cancers. Male sex [OR: 1.84 (95%CI:1.08-3.13)], Asian ethnicity [3.86 (1.20-12.36)], haematological cancer type [2.16 (1.18-3.95)], being diagnosed with cancer for 2-5 years [3.74 (1.80-7.78)] or 5 years [3.06 (1.50-6.26)] and a ferritin > 1964 mcg/l [54.92 (5.90-511.33)] were all associated with a risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. Similarly, male sex [HR:1.97 (95%CI:1.15-3.38)], Asian ethnicity [3.42 (1. 59-7.35)], haematological cancer type [2.03 (1.16-3.56)] as well as a cancer diagnosis for >2-5 years [2.81 (1.41-5.59)] or 5 years [2.13 (1.06-4.27)] and a ferritin > 1964 mcg/l [16.11 (3.81-68.17)] were associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. Age >60 [2.14 (1.15-3.98)] and a raised CRP [4.10 (1.66-10.10)] were also associated with COVID-19 death. An inverse relationship was observed between a raised albumin and COVID-19 related death [0.12 (0.03- 0.51)]. Performance status and treatment paradigm were not associated with COVID-19 severity or mortality. Conclusions: This study further substantiates the evidence for an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality for male and Asian patients with cancer, and those with haematological malignancies or with a diagnosis of cancer for over 2 years.

Results9/25 (36%) KTR under standard immunosuppressive treatment seroconverted until day 27 after the third vaccination, while one patient developed severe COVID-19 infection immediately after vaccination. Cellular analysis seven days after the third dose showed significantly elevated frequencies of viral spike protein receptor binding domain specific B cells in humoral responders as compared to non-responders. Likewise, portions of spike-reactive CD4+ T helper cells were significantly elevated in seroconverting patients. Furthermore, overall frequencies of IL-2+, IL-4+ and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells significantly increased after the third dose, whereas memory/effector differentiation remained unaffected. ConclusionsOur data suggest that a fraction of transplant recipients benefits from triple vaccination, where seroconversion is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes of cellular immunity. At the same time, the study highlights that modified vaccination approaches for immunosuppressed patients still remain an urgent medical need.

The discussion evaluates the tremendous effect of integrating the participatory qualitative method with other analytical and digital tools, such as modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to deduce scientific details and activities in the preliminary phases of zoning plans. This results in a constructive framework for merging these multi-methods and tools within the participatory eco-landscape design process. In addition, the conclusion highlights the peculiarity of the eco-landscape design and practice in the current Egyptian situation in a broad sense.","output":"Participatory eco-landscape design: the case of NRIAG eco-park in Helwan, Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To outline which infectious diseases in the pre-covid-19 era persist in children and adolescents in China and to describe recent trends and variations by age, sex, season, and province. DESIGN: National surveillance studies, 2008-17. SETTING: 31 provinces in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: 4 959 790 Chinese students aged 6 to 22 years with a diagnosis of any of 44 notifiable infectious diseases. The diseases were categorised into seven groups: quarantinable; vaccine preventable; gastrointestinal and enteroviral; vectorborne; zoonotic; bacterial; and sexually transmitted and bloodborne. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of, and deaths from, 44 notifiable infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2017, 44 notifiable infectious diseases were diagnosed in 4 959 790 participants (3 045 905 males, 1 913 885 females) and there were 2532 deaths (1663 males, 869 females). The leading causes of death among infectious diseases shifted from rabies and tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS, particularly in males. Mortality from infectious diseases decreased steadily from 0.21 per 100 000 population in 2008 to 0.07 per 100 000 in 2017. Quarantinable conditions with high mortality have effectively disappeared. The incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in children and adolescents decreased from 280 per 100 000 in 2008 to 162 per 100 000 in 2015, but rose again to 242 per 100 000 in 2017, largely related to mumps and seasonal influenza. Excluding mumps and influenza, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases fell from 96 per 100 000 in 2008 to 7 per 100 000 in 2017. The incidence of gastrointestinal and enterovirus diseases remained constant, but typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery continued to decline. Vectorborne diseases all declined, with a particularly noticeable reduction in malaria. Zoonotic infections remained at low incidence, but there were still unpredictable outbreaks, such as pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza. Tuberculosis remained the most common bacterial infection, although cases of scarlet fever doubled between 2008 and 2017. Sexually transmitted diseases and bloodborne infections increased significantly, particularly from 2011 to 2017, among which HIV/AIDS increased fivefold, particularly in males. Difference was noticeable between regions, with children and adolescents in western China continuing to carry a disproportionate burden from infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Chinas success in infectious disease control in the pre-covid-19 era was notable, with deaths due to infectious diseases in children and adolescents aged 6-22 years becoming rare. Many challenges remain around reducing regional inequalities, scaling-up of vaccination, prevention of further escalation of HIV/AIDS, renewed efforts for persisting diseases, and undertaking early and effective response to highly transmissible seasonal and unpredictable diseases such as that caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Infectious diseases in children and adolescents in China: analysis of national surveillance data from 2008 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health concern worldwide, raising important medical and economic issues.

Objective: To investigate the effect of raising serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to 50-100 ng/mL with oral extended-release calcifediol (ERC) on time to symptom resolution in mild to moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated treatment of 160 outpatients with COVID-19 diagnosed between November 2020 and October 2021. Interventions: Patients were treated for 4 weeks with ERC (30 mcg/capsule; 300 mcg on Days 1-3 and 60 mcg on Days 4-27) or placebo. Outcome Measures: Primary endpoints were raising serum 25D to >=50 ng/mL at Day 14 and resolution time for five aggregated symptoms. Secondary endpoints included resolution time for aggregated and individual symptoms as a function of serum 25D and changes in clinical biomarkers. Results: 171 subjects randomized, 160 treated and 134 (65 ERC and 69 placebo) retained. Average age was 43 (range: 18-71); 59% female, 92% White, 80% Hispanic, 7% African-American, 1% Other, 76% overweight, 40% obese, 26% comorbidities, mean baseline 25D of 37+-1 (SE) ng/mL. ERC increased mean 25D to 82+-ng/mL (p<0.001) by Day 7; 88% of subjects attained a level >=50 ng/mL; the placebo group trended lower. Resolution time for five aggregated symptoms was unchanged by ERC given that two composite non-respiratory symptoms responded poorly. Prespecified analyses showed that respiratory symptoms tended to resolve earlier when serum 25D levels reached >=50 ng/mL, but statistical significance was limited by small sample size and non-compliance: 25D increased in seven placebo subjects (unauthorized supplementation) and none occurred in five ERC subjects (failure to dose). A post-hoc composite of three respiratory symptoms (trouble breathing, chest congestion and dry or hacking cough) resolved 3.0 days faster when 25D was elevated at Days 7 and 14 (p<0.05); chest congestion resolved 4.0 days faster with 25D increases of >=25 ng/mL (p<0.05). Safety concerns including hypercalcemia were absent with ERC treatment. Conclusions and Relevance: ERC was effective in increasing serum 25D in outpatients with COVID-19, which may have accelerated resolution of respiratory symptoms suggesting mitigation of COVID-19 pneumonia risk, findings which warrant further study.

No studies to date have examined the impact of using Do-It-Yourself Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (DIY RT-CGM) on psychological and glycemic outcomes. Child-parent dyads were recruited for a multicentre randomized crossover trial. Children with T1D were current intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) users and aged 2-13 years. Families received either 6 weeks of DIY RT-CGM with parental remote monitoring (intervention) or 6 weeks of isCGM plus usual diabetes care (control), followed by a four-week washout period, then crossed over. The primary outcome was parental FOH. Secondary outcomes were glycemic control using traditional CGM metrics, as well as a range of other psychosocial measures. 55 child-parent dyads were recruited. The child mean age was 9.12.8 years. Although, there was no effect on parental FOH, -0.1 (95%CI: -0.3, 0.1, P = 0.4), time-in-range (TIR) (%3.9-10mmol/L) was significantly higher with DIY RT-CGM over isCGM (54.3%13.7 vs. 48.1%13.6), mean difference, 5.7% (95%CI 1.8, 9.6, P<0.004).

In this study, we generated a VV-based CPV2 vaccine candidate (VV-CPV-VP2) and then evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and dogs. The exogenous vp2 gene of CPV2, which replaced the major virulence gene hemagglutinin (ha) of VV, expressed efficiently and stably in vitro. Subsequently, intramuscular immunization of mice induced robust and lasting systemic immune responses, including neutralizing antibody against both CPV2a and CPV2b, and CPV2-VP2-specific interferon gamma (IFN-?3) secreting T cell. In addition, administration with a high-dose of VV-CPV-VP2 did not cause significant side effects for mice, thus indicating marked safety of this vaccine candidate. Most importantly, a single-dose vaccination of VV-CPV2-VP2 elicited substantial antibody responses and provided comparable protection for dogs with attenuated CPV2 vaccine.

Based on this premise, we sought to design a ventilator with the following criteria: 1) standard components that are accessible to the public, 2) \\"open-source\\" compatibility to allow anyone to easily recreate the system, 3) ability to ventilate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 4) lowest possible cost to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Design: We pursued development of a pneumatic-type ventilator. The basic design involves three electrically controlled solenoid valves, a pressure chamber, the patient breathing circuit, a positive end-expiratory pressure valve, and an electronics control system. Multiple safety elements were built into the design. The user-friendly interface allows simple control of ventilator settings. The ventilator delivers a hybrid form of pneumatic, assist-control ventilation, with predicted tidal volumes of 300-800 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure 0-20 cm H2O, and Fio2 21-100%. Main Results: The ventilator was extensively tested with two separate high-fidelity lung simulators and a porcine in vivo model. Both lung simulators were able to simulate a variety of pathologic states, including obstructive lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ventilator performed well across all simulated scenarios. Similarly, a porcine in vivo model was used to assess performance in live tissue, with a specific emphasis on gas exchange. The ventilator performed well in vivo and demonstrated noninferior ventilation and oxygenation when compared with the standard ventilator. Conclusions: The Portsmouth Ventilator was able to perform well across all simulated pathologies and in vivo. All components may be acquired by the public for a cost of approximately $250 U.S.D.

As symptoms progress, dyads are at risk for elevated emotional distress and declines in relationship functioning and quality of life. Psychosocial interventions delivered to dyads early after diagnosis have successfully prevented chronic emotional distress across several chronic illnesses including cancer and acute brain injury. Dyads with NDD could benefit from such interventions, however, they are limited. Because NDDs have symptom profiles that are distinct from other chronic illnesses, they require a unique framework and interventions. Given the limited dyadic interventions and unified symptoms across NDDs, a transdiagnostic framework may help to enhance scalability and efficiency. To address this problem, we developed a transdiagnostic framework that cuts across NDD physical and emotional diagnoses to inform cost-effective and sustainable NDD dyadic interventions. METHODS: To develop this framework, we conducted: (1) a narrative review on dyadic adjustment and existent dyadic interventions for those with NDDs, and (2) integrated findings to develop our NDD transdiagnostic framework for dyadic interventions early after diagnosis. RESULTS: Findings revealed no existent dyadic interventions for NDDs delivered shortly after diagnosis. Among available interventions, all were delivered later in disease progression, thereby focusing on dyadic challenges at more advanced stages. In addition, although research emphasized the influence of individual, dyadic, and contextual factors on dyads' early adjustment to NDDs, no conceptual model has been developed. Informed by theory and current research, we introduce an NDD transdiagnostic framework for couples' early biopsychosocial adjustment. This framework includes NDD specific: contextual factors, illness-related factors, individual and dyadic stressors, adaptive coping strategies, and dyads' resources. CONCLUSIONS: Our NDD transdiagnostic framework can be used to inform early dyadic psychosocial interventions that cut across all NDDs. This approach has important implications for implementation and scalability.","output":"Together from the start: A transdiagnostic framework for early dyadic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCW) treating COVID-19 patients are at high risk for infection and may also spread infection through their contact with vulnerable patients. Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals. In this study we sought to determine if tracking smell sensitivity and loss using an at-home assessment could identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a prospective cohort study tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, behavioral at-home assessment of olfaction with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our main measures were the prevalence of smell loss in SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW versus SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW, and timing of smell loss relative to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to report smell loss than SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (9/17, 53% vs 105/456, 23%, P < .01). 6/9 (67%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW reporting smell loss reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW who reported smell loss compared to those without smell loss (9/9, 100% vs 3/8, 38%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although often asymptomatic, a relevant percentage of affected people can develop severe pneumonia. Initial evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis, as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV. The presence of genome composition features involved in delaying viral recognition is herein investigated for human coronaviruses (HCoVs), with a special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. A broad collection of HCoVs polyprotein, envelope, matrix, nucleocapsid and spike coding sequences was downloaded and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were investigated. A model able to evaluate and test the presence of a significant under- or over-representation of dinucleotide pairs while accounting for the underlying codon bias and protein sequence was also implemented. The study revealed the significant under-representation of CpG dinucleotide pair in all HcoV, but especially in SARS-CoV and even more in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of forces acting to minimize CpG content was confirmed by relative synonymous codon usage pattern. Codons containing the CpG pair were severely under-represented, primarily in the polyprotein and spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a significant under-representation of the TpA pair was observed in the N and S region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Increasing experimental evidence has proven that CpG and TpA are targeted by innate antiviral host defences, contributing both to RNA degradation and RIG-1 mediated interferon production. The low content of these dinucleotides could contribute to a delayed interferon production, dysregulated immune response, higher viral replication and poor outcome. Significantly, the RIG-1 signalling pathway was proven to be defective in elderlies, suggesting a likely interaction between limited viral recognition and lower responsiveness in interferon production that could justify the higher disease severity and mortality in older patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus show genome patterns previously associated to reduced viral recognition and altered immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported for the first time in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and causes respiratory infection This pandemic pneumonia killed about 1,437,835 people out of 61,308,161cases up to November 27, 2020 The disease's main clinical complications include fever, recurrent coughing, shortness of breath, acute respiratory syndrome, and failure of vital organs that could lead to death It has been shown that natural compounds with antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities and RNA interference agents could play an essential role in preventing or treating coronavirus infection by inhibiting the expression of crucial virus genes This study aims to introduce a summary of coronavirus's genetic and morphological structure and determine the role of miRNAs, siRNAs, chemical drugs, and natural compounds in stimulating the immune system or inhibiting the virus's structural and non-structural genes that are essential for replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2","output":"The Potential Therapeutic Effect of RNA Interference and Natural Products on COVID-19: A Review of the Coronaviruses Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health issue that has long threatened and continues to threaten human health.

The gaps are not mainly due to a lack of financial capital in global financial markets that might be deployed for this purpose. The main problems are associated with the market environment in the sense that sustainable business operations require adequate demand, and market demand for pharmaceutical products in Africa is limited by various factors. In addition, comparatively weak infrastructure (recognizing variation among countries) makes it difficult to compete with large efficient foreign suppliers that are bolstered by foreign government support.

Government commitment at a high level is required to engage the financial levers that will support localization of production.<br><br>Sustainable business models:<br><br>Particularly outside the vaccine sector, successfully operating a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility means addressing a market with sufficient demand to generate revenue and profits. Alternatively, or as a supplement, governments may provide direct subsidies, guaranteed offtake agreements, tax credits, local production pricing premiums, and other measures to substitute for market demand. These forms of support are commonly used for infant industries, and there should be plans to withdraw such support once a business has achieved sustainability.<br><br>The social impact investor market:<br><br>African governments should consider a program to encourage sovereign wealth funds and other financial asset managers to invest in local production on the African continent as a way to accomplish important social goals. To facilitate this objective, there should be some type of backstop or guarantee of the social impact investments within reasonable parameters. The African Development Bank may be helpful in establishing mechanisms for this purpose.<br><br>Opportunities for advocacy:<br><br>There is substantial room for advocacy by civil society to move Africa toward greater self-sufficiency in the production of pharmaceutical products. At the high level of political commitment, government authorities should be persuaded to prioritize local production of pharmaceuticals as a matter of public health security, engaging the financial levers to support such a commitment. At the level of industrial policy, the African Union should be encouraged to engage in concrete planning for regional pharmaceutical production hubs, and associated infrastructure and centers of technical expertise.

These integral membrane proteins assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells and are subsequently endoproteolyzed in the Golgi, generating noncovalently associated S1 and S2 fragments. Once on the surface of infected cells and virions, peripheral S1 fragments bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors, and this triggers membrane fusion reactions mediated by integral membrane S2 fragments. We focused on the quaternary structure of S and its interaction with CEACAMs. We discovered that soluble S1 fragments were dimers and that CEACAM binding was entirely dependent on this quaternary structure. However, two differentially tagged CEACAMs could not co-precipitate with the S dimers, suggesting that binding sites were closely juxtaposed in the dimer (steric hindrance) or that a single CEACAM generated global conformational changes that precluded additional interactions (negative cooperativity). CEACAM binding did indeed alter S1 conformations, generating alternative disulfide linkages that were revealed on SDS gels. CEACAM binding also induced separation of S1 and S2. Differentially tagged S2 fragments that were free of S1 dimers were not co-precipitated, suggesting that S1 harbored the primary oligomerization determinants. We discuss the distinctions between the SCEACAM interaction and other virus-receptor complexes involved in receptor-triggered entry.","output":"Quaternary Structure of Coronavirus Spikes in Complex with Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule Cellular Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES) provides regulatory compliant open access to sensitive patient data that have been integrated with public exposures data. ICEES was designed initially to support dynamic cohort creation and bivariate contingency tests. The objective of the present study was to develop an open approach to support multivariate analyses using existing ICEES functionalities and abiding by all regulatory constraints. We first developed an open approach for generating a multivariate table that maintains contingencies between clinical and environmental variables using programmatic calls to the open ICEES application programming interface. We then applied the approach to data on a large cohort (N = 22,365) of patients with asthma or related conditions and generated an eight feature table. Due to regulatory constraints, data loss was incurred with the incorporation of each successive feature variable, from a starting sample size of N = 22,365 to a final sample size of N = 4,556 (20.5%), but data loss was < 10% until the addition of the final two feature variables. We then applied a generalized linear model to the subsequent dataset and focused on the impact of seven select feature variables on asthma exacerbations, defined as annual emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues. We identified five feature variables sex, race, obesity, prednisone, and airborne particulate exposure as significant predictors of asthma exacerbations. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ICEES open multivariate analysis and conclude that, despite limitations, ICEES can provide a valuable resource for open multivariate analysis and can serve as an exemplar for regulatory compliant informatics solutions to open patient data, with capabilities to explore the impact of environmental exposures on health outcomes.","output":"An Approach for Open Multivariate Analysis of Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic patient education (TPE) aims to empower the patients and their caregivers to effectively care for and manage their conditions.

Most of the important theories that helped shape TPE were inspired from the social sciences. Five important research themes were identified: disorders, study designs utilized in TPE research, the scope of the TPE literature and outcomes, and populations. The research focused on improving perceptions, behaviors, and attitudes toward health promotion, reducing stigma, self-management and medication adherence. Most of the research was developed in the context of high-income countries. Future research should involve patients and use digital technology.

Between March 24, 2020, and May 22, 2020, 4 cases (3 females; 1 male) of SAH were identified in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in a comprehensive neurological center in Brazil. The median age was 55.25 years (range 36 -71). COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe in 3 out of 4 cases, and all patients required critical care support during hospitalization. The patients developed Fisher grade III and IV SAH. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in 3 of the 4 patients. However, in only 1 case, an aneurysm was identified. Inflammatory blood tests were elevated in all cases, with an average D-dimer of 2336 g/L and mean C-reactive protein (CRP) of 3835 mg/dl The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients, with 1 death (25%); 2 (50%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS:4); and 1 (25%) had slight disability (mRS:2).

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver, but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways, as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers, with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific. Functionally, NASH liver organoids exhibit reduced passaging/growth capacity and show hallmarks of NASH liver, including decreased albumin production, increased free fatty acid induced lipid accumulation, increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and increased CYP450 metabolism. After hepatic differentiation, NASH liver organoids exhibit reduced ability to dedifferentiate back to the biliary state, consistent with the known reduced regenerative ability of NASH livers. Intriguingly, NASH liver organoids also show strongly increased permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2-VSV pseudovirus as well as upregulation of ubiquitin D (Fat10), a known inhibitor of the antiviral interferon host response. CONCLUSION: Expansion of primary liver stem cells/organoids derived directly from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver opens up new experimental avenues for personalized disease modeling and drug development that has the potential to slow human NASH progression and to counteract NASH related SARS-CoV-2 effects.","output":"Functional characterization of organoids derived from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Thoracic duct embolization (TDE) is an acceptable alternative procedure for treating traumatic chylothorax. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of TDE in treating nontraumatic chylous effusions. METHODS A retrospective review of 34 patients was conducted assessing technical and clinical success of TDE for nontraumatic chylous effusions. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (mean age, 59 years; 27 female patients) with nontraumatic chylous effusions underwent TDE. Presentations included 21 unilateral chylothoraces (61.8%), nine bilateral chylothoraces (26.5%), two isolated chylopericardiums (5.9%), and two pleural effusions with chylopericardium (5.9%). TDE was technically successful in 24 of 34 patients (70.6%). The thoracic duct could not be catheterized in four of 34 (11.8%). Cisterna chyli was not visualized in six of 34 patients (17.6%), and, thus, TDE was not attempted. Follow-up was available for 32 patients. Four lymphangiographic patterns were observed: (1) normal thoracic duct in 17.6% of patients (six of 34), (2) occlusion of thoracic duct in 58.8% (20 of 34), (3) failure to opacify thoracic duct in 17.6% (six of 34), and (4) extravasation of chyle in 5.9% (two of 34). Clinical success varied with the lymphangiographic pattern. The clinical success rate was 16% (one of six) in cases of normal thoracic duct, 75% (15 of 20 patients) in occlusions of the thoracic duct, 16% (one of six) in cases of failure to opacify the thoracic duct, and 50% in two cases of chyle extravasation. Lymphangiography alone cured two patients (6.5%). CONCLUSION TDE was most successful in cases of thoracic duct occlusion and extravasation.

The number of newly registered rheumatologists has stagnated. Primary care, which takes up a key role in early detection of rheumatic disease, is working at full capacity. COVID-19 and its containment impede rheumatological treatment. Telemedicine in rheumatology (telerheumatology) could support rheumatologists and general practitioners. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate acceptance and preferences related to the use of telerheumatology care among German rheumatologists and general practitioners. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional, self-completed, paper-based survey on telerheumatology care was conducted among outpatient rheumatologists and general practitioners during the pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: A total of 73.3% (349/476) of survey participants rated their knowledge of telemedicine as unsatisfactory, poor, or very poor. The majority of survey participants (358/480, 74.6%) answered that they do not currently use telemedicine, although 62.3% (291/467) would like to. Barriers to the implementation of telemedicine include the purchase of technology equipment (182/292, 62.3%), administration (181/292, 62.0%), and poor reimbursement (156/292, 53.4%). A total of 69.6% (117/168) of the surveyed physicians reckoned that telemedicine could be used in rheumatology. Surveyed physicians would prefer to use telemedicine to communicate directly with other physicians (370/455, 81.3%) than to communicate with patients (213/455, 46.8%). Among treatment phases, 64.4% (291/452) of participants would choose to use telemedicine during follow-up. Half of the participants would choose telecounseling as a specific approach to improve rheumatology care (91/170, 53.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Before COVID-19 appeared, our results indicated generally low use but high acceptance of the implementation of telerheumatology among physicians. Participants indicated that the lack of a structural framework was a barrier to the effective implementation of telerheumatology. Training courses should be introduced to address the limited knowledge on the part of physicians in the use of telemedicine. More research into telerheumatology is required. This includes large-scale randomized controlled trials, economic analyses, and the exploration of user preferences.","output":"Acceptance of Telerheumatology by Rheumatologists and General Practitioners in Germany: Nationwide Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a nomogram for early identification of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on initial clinical and CT characteristics.

Two hundred seventeen patients with 146 mild cases and 71 severe cases were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Independent risk factors were selected to construct the nomogram for predicting severe COVID-19. Nomogram performance in terms of discrimination and calibration ability was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve and risk chart. RESULTS: In the training cohort, the severity score of lung in the severe group (7, interquartile range [IQR]:5C9) was significantly higher than that of the mild group (4, IQR,2C5) (P < 0.001). Age, density, mosaic perfusion sign and severity score of lung were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. The nomogram had a AUC of 0.929 (95% CI, 0.889C0.969), sensitivity of 84.0% and specificity of 86.3%, in the training cohort, and a AUC of 0.936 (95% CI, 0.867C1.000), sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 88.6% in the validation cohort.

Due to a high attendance burden at the specialized level, most emotional disorders in Spain are treated in primary care, where they are usually misdiagnosed and treated using psychotropic drugs. This contributes to perpetuate their illness and increase health care costs. Following the IAPT programme and the transdiagnostic approach, the PsicAP project developed a brief group transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural therapy (tCBT) as a cost-effective alternative. However, it is not suitable for everyone; in some cases, one-on-one sessions may be more effective. The objective of the present study is to compare, in cost-benefit terms, group and individual tCBT with the treatment usually administered in Spanish primary care (TAU). METHODS: A randomized, controlled, multicentre, and single-blinded trial will be performed. Adults with mild to moderate emotional disorders will be recruited and placed in one of three arms: group tCBT, individual tCBT, or TAU. Medical data and outcomes regarding emotional symptoms, disability, quality of life, and emotion regulation biases will be collected at baseline, immediately after treatment, and 6 and 12 months later. The data will be used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to contribute to clinical practice research. The involvement of psychologists in primary care and the implementation of a stepped-care model for mental disorders are recommended. Group therapy and a transdiagnostic approach may help optimize health system resources and unblock waiting lists so that people can spend less time experiencing mental health problems.

Objective To assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks. Design, Setting, and Participants This study included 2 components: a national survey to examine the acceptability of using robotic systems to perform health care tasks in a hospital setting and a single-site cohort study of patient experiences and satisfaction with the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate triage and telehealth tasks in the emergency department (ED). The national survey comprised individuals living in the US who participated in a sampling-based survey via an online analytic platform. Participants completed the national survey between August 18 and August 21, 2020. The single-site cohort study included patients living in the US who presented to the ED of a large urban academic hospital providing quaternary care in Boston, Massachusetts between April and August 2020. All data were analyzed from August to October 2020. Exposures Participants in the national survey completed an online survey to measure the acceptability of using a mobile robotic system to perform health care tasks (facilitating telehealth interviews, acquiring vital signs, obtaining nasal or oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, performing phlebotomy, and turning a patient in bed) in a hospital setting in the contexts of general interaction and interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in the cohort study were exposed to a mobile robotic system, which was controlled by an ED clinician and used to facilitate a triage interview. After exposure, patients completed an assessment to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main Outcomes and Measures Acceptability of the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks in a hospital setting (national survey) and feasibility and patient satisfaction regarding the use of a mobile robotic system in the ED (cohort study). Results For the national survey, 1154 participants completed all acceptability questions, representing a participation rate of 35%. After sample matching, a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [17.0] years; 535 women [53.5%]) was included in the analysis. With regard to the usefulness of a robotic system to perform specific health care tasks, the response of \\"somewhat useful\\" was selected by 373 participants (37.3%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 350 participants (35.0%) for acquiring vital signs, 307 participants (30.7%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 228 participants (22.8%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 249 participants (24.9%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. The response of \\"extremely useful\\" was selected by 287 participants (28.7%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 413 participants (41.3%) for acquiring vital signs, 192 participants (19.2%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 159 participants (15.9%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 167 participants (16.7%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of individuals who perceived the application of robotic systems to be acceptable for completing telehealth interviews, obtaining nasal and oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, and performing phlebotomy increased. For the ED cohort study, 51 individuals were invited to participate, and 41 participants (80.4%) enrolled. One participant was unable to complete the study procedures because of a signaling malfunction in the robotic system. Forty patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [2.7] years; 29 women [72.5%]) completed the mobile robotic system-facilitated triage interview, and 37 patients (92.5%) reported that the interaction was satisfactory.

In Germany, more than 3.4 million cases are confirmed so far, including 83,000 deaths. Increased fatality rates among patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent this group at particular risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in health perception among patients with aortic diseases during the first (w1) and second wave (w2) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Material and Methods: Patients (n = 262) diagnosed with aortic disease participated in telephone interviews during w1 and w2. The perception of COVID-19 as a threat was examined using relevant items of the Brief Illness Perception (BIP) questionnaire. Results: The BIP score increased from 9.18 (SD = 7.132) to 14.58 (SD = 6.956) between w1 and w2 (p < 0.001). Although this population is at high risk their overall perception of COVID-19 as a threat was low in the beginning, but surged during w2. Main reasons were increased effects on personal life and elevated concerns about the pandemic, but did not include the educational aspect of COVID-19.

From March 1 to April 25, 2020, New York City, New York (NYC), reported 17a?118 COVID-19-related deaths. On April 6, 2020, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests peaked at 305 cases, nearly a 10-fold increase from the prior year. Objective: To describe the characteristics (race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and emergency medical services [EMS] response) associated with outpatient cardiac arrests and death during the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, cross-sectional study compared patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving resuscitation by the NYC 911 EMS system from March 1 to April 25, 2020, compared with March 1 to April 25, 2019. The NYC 911 EMS system serves more than 8.4 million people. Exposures: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics associated with out-of-hospital arrests and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Results: A total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years), 3989 in the COVID-19 period and 1336 in the comparison period. The incidence of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in those who underwent EMS resuscitation in 2020 was 3 times the incidence in 2019 (47.5/100a?000 vs 15.9/100a?000). Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during 2020 were older (mean [SD] age, 72 [18] vs 68 [19] years), less likely to be white (611 of 2992 [20.4%] vs 382 of 1161 [32.9%]), and more likely to have hypertension (2134 of 3989 [53.5%] vs 611 of 1336 [45.7%]), diabetes (1424 of 3989 [35.7%] vs 348 of 1336 [26.0%]), and physical limitations (2259 of 3989 [56.6%] vs 634 of 1336 [47.5%]). Compared with 2019, the odds of asystole increased in the COVID-19 period (odds ratio [OR], 3.50; 95% CI, 2.53-4.84; P < .001), as did the odds of pulseless electrical activity (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.02; P = .001). Compared with 2019, the COVID-19 period had substantial reductions in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (727 of 3989 patients [18.2%] vs 463 of 1336 patients [34.7%], P < .001) and sustained ROSC (423 of 3989 patients [10.6%] vs 337 of 1336 patients [25.2%], P < .001), with fatality rates exceeding 90%. These associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders (OR for ROSC, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.50-0.70; P < .001]; OR for sustained ROSC, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.43-0.64; P < .001]).

Keeping schools open has emerged as a vital societal imperative during the pandemic, but in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to further prolonging the pandemic. In this context, the role of schools in driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission acquires critical importance. Here we model in-school transmission from first principles to investigate the effectiveness of layered mitigation strategies on limiting in-school spread. We examine the effect of masks and air quality (ventilation, filtration and ionizers) on steady-state viral load in classrooms, as well as on the number of particles inhaled by an uninfected person. The effectiveness of these measures in limiting viral transmission is assessed for variants with different levels of mean viral load (Wuhan, Delta, Omicron). Our results suggest that a layered mitigation strategy can be used effectively to limit in-school transmission, with certain limitations. First, poorly designed strategies (insufficient ventilation, no masks, staying open under high levels of community transmission) will permit in-school spread even if some level of mitigation is ostensibly present. Second, for viral variants that are sufficiently contagious, it may be difficult to construct any set of interventions capable of blocking transmission once an infected individual is present, underscoring the importance of other measures. Our findings provide several practical recommendations: the use of a layered mitigation strategy that is designed to limit transmission, with other measures such as frequent surveillance testing and smaller class sizes (such as by offering remote schooling options to those who prefer it) as needed.","output":"No magic bullet: limiting in-school transmission in the face of variable SARS-CoV-2 viral loads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Transmission of COVID-19 through close contact and droplets is well established, but the influence of aerosol and surface contamination remains to be determined. Literature is scarce and inconsistent about the viable virus particles free-distance from infected patients, as well as about different swabbing methods for surface contamination evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most sensitive method for the assessment of surface contamination, classify the likelihood of environmental contamination in risk zones and compare the environmental contamination between oxygenation and ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHODS Swabs from potentially contaminated surfaces in a COVID-19 ward, with patients treated with different types of oxygen and ventilatory support, were collected. Three types of swabs were compared in order to evaluate the most sensitive collection method. For risk zone categorization, areas were divided according to the distance from the patient. RESULTS Of the 63 swabs collected, 17 (27%) tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The highest positivity rate was observed with the sterile premoistened swab with saline (n = 8; 38%), but without statistically significant differences. The highest number of positive samples were collected from the high-risk zones, specifically those located one meter from the patient (n = 13; 48%), with statistically significant differences. Only the rooms of patients supported with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula had evidence of bedroom contamination, with 45% and 27% of swab positivity, with statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION Our findings favour the premoistened swab without transport medium for surface contamination assessment, even though without statistical differences. A statistically significant trend supporting the division in risk zones, according to the distance from the patient, was also identified. The higher positivity rate from the non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula bedrooms suggests a significant association between ventilatory strategies and surface contamination, probably due to higher particle dispersion. CONCLUSION Our findings support the use of the sterile premoistened swab without preservation medium, the classification of risk areas considering the distance from the patient, and the variability of RNA dispersion between oxygenation and ventilatory support.","output":"Sampling Methods and Risk Stratification Regarding Environmental Contamination by SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been instrumental in creating a dramatic shift from people's need to live in mutual association toward a desire to stigmatize distinctive others.

We sought to understand how the pandemic has impacted grocery shopping patterns among adolescents and young adults, including the shopping mediums (i.e., in-person, pick-up, or delivery) and types of goods purchased. METHODS: This research is part of MyVoice, a national text message survey of US adolescents and young adults between 14 and 24 years old. In November 2020, this cohort was asked these open-ended questions: 1) During the pandemic, how have you or your family been getting groceries (in-person, pick-up, delivery)? Why? 2) If you or your family have shopped for groceries online during the pandemic, was it pick-up or delivery? How did it go? 3) During the pandemic, have you or your family changed the types of food you are buying? Tell us about it. Responses were assessed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 889 responses (RR = 77.6%), 47% were female, 56% were White, 13% were Hispanic, and median age was 18 (interquartile range 17, 21). Since the pandemic began, 86% of respondents reported at least use of in-person grocery shopping. Meanwhile, 46% indicated they had used a form of online grocery shopping; 26% reported use of delivery and 27% reported use of pick-up. Over half of participants using online shopping had a positive experience. Half of respondents changed their grocery purchase choices since the pandemic began, among whom 33% reported healthier purchases, 27% bought more snack foods, 24% bought in bulk and/or more non-perishable foods, and 10% bought more foods to cook at home. CONCLUSIONS: Among young people, online grocery shopping is widely utilized with generally positive perceptions, although in-person shopping remains most prevalent. While many young people reported healthier purchases, there was a tendency toward more snack and non-perishable foods. Further investigation is needed to understand reasons behind changes in purchasing habits of adolescents and young adults and the impact of these changes on diet quality during the pandemic.

COVI-VAC? is a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 strain based on WA/1 being developed as an intranasal COVID-19 vaccine. COVI-VAC is attenuated through removal of the furin cleavage site and introduction of 283 silent, deoptimizing mutations that maintain viral amino acid sequence but slow viral replication in vivo by up to 5 logs. Notably, COVI-VAC presents all viral antigens in their native conformation and is not limited to spike. COVI-VAC demonstrated attenuation, immunogenicity and single dose protection in both the Syrian golden hamster and non-human primate models and currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated efficacy of COVI-VAC against challenge with the Beta/B.1.351 variant in Syrian golden hamsters. METHODS: Syrian golden hamsters, 7-10 weeks of age were, vaccinated intranasally with 8.25x10(4) PFU COVI-VAC (n=28) or vehicle control (n=16). Twenty seven days post-vaccination, animals were challenged intranasally with 3x10(4) PFU of wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Beta. Animals were weighed daily. Further analysis is being conducted with serum and key tissues from pre and post challenge timepoints to include neutralizing antibody, biodistribution (subgenomic qPCR) and histopathology.

Request volumes were used as a measure of the routine care of patients, as clinical information was not readily available. METHODS A retrospective audit was conducted. The numbers of requests received from OPDs and peripheral clinics for creatinine, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine (fT3), serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains and neonatal total serum bilirubin were obtained from 1 March to 30 June for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. RESULTS The biggest impact was seen on lipids, creatinine, HbA1c, TSH and fT3. The percentage reduction between 1 March and 30 June 2019 and between 1 March and 30 June 2020 was 59% for lipids, 64% for creatinine and HbA1c, 80% for TSH and 81% for fT3.

We hypothesized that distinct nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota structures exist in pediatric populations, relate to environmental exposures and modify risk of acute sinusitis or upper respiratory infection (URI) in children. METHODS: Bacterial 16S rRNA profiles from nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 354) collected longitudinally over a one-year period from 58 children, aged four to seven years, were analyzed and correlated with environmental variables, URI, and sinusitis outcomes. RESULTS: Variance in nasopharyngeal microbiota composition significantly related to clinical outcomes, participant characteristics and environmental exposures including dominant bacterial genus, season, daycare attendance and tobacco exposure. Four distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota structures (Cluster I-IV) were evident and differed with respect to URI and sinusitis outcomes. These clusters were characteristically either dominated by Moraxella with sparse underlying taxa (Cluster I), comprised of a non-dominated, diverse microbiota (Cluster II), dominated by Alloiococcus/Corynebacterium (Cluster III), or by Haemophilus (Cluster IV). Cluster I was associated with increased risk of URI and sinusitis (RR = 1.18, p = 0.046; RR = 1.25, p = 0.009, respectively) in the population studied.

Loneliness and isolation in older adults might have serious negative consequences for their mental health. For this reason, this research aims to analyze the role of family function in the anxiety and depression experienced by older adults during the pandemic caused by COVID-19. Participants were 882 Spanish community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age. Sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics related to the coronavirus, self-perceived health, family function, avoidance, depression and anxiety were analyzed. Data suggest a buffering effect of family function on anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Furthermore, being unmarried or a female, greater fear of COVID-19, worse self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and worse family function were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Likewise, greater fear of COVID-19, poorer self-perceived health, greater avoidance, and poorer family function, were associated with greater depression. These results point out that family dysfunction is a predisposing factor for the development of the emotional problems of anxiety and depression in older people in potentially stressful and loss situations.

However, no comprehensive data have been reported on pre-existing neurological comorbidities and COVID-19. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of neurological comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We evaluated all consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) of our hospital between the 3rd March and the 14th April 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Data on neurological and non-neurological diseases were extracted, as well as data on demographic characteristics and on severity degree of COVID-19. The prevalence of neurological comorbidities was calculated, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between neurological diseases and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 344 patients. Neurological comorbidities accounted for 22.4% of cases, with cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment being the most frequent. Neurological comorbidity resulted independently associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 2.305; p = 0.012), as well as male gender (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), neoplastic diseases (p = 0.039), and arterial hypertension (p = 0.045). When neurological comorbidity was associated with non-neurological comorbidities, the OR for severe COVID-19 rose to 7.394 (p = 0.005). Neurological patients, in particular cerebrovascular and cognitively impaired ones, received more respiratory support indication. CONCLUSION: Neurological comorbidities represent a significant determinant of COVID-19 severity, deserving a thorough evaluation since the earliest phases of infection.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, a nationwide CDC database which aggregates information on violent deaths, we extracted demographic and circumstantial data on 172,135 suicide decedents a룤 25 years old in participating states from 2003-2017. Of these, we found complete information regarding demographics, occupation, and circumstance for 160,159 suicide decedents. We separated suicide decedents by physician-status and compared 795 physicians to 159,364 non-physician decedents using chi-squared test. We then used multivariate logistic regression to examine differences in suicide method and circumstance by physician-status status, controlling for age, sex, and race. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Compared to non-physicians, physicians were more likely to be male (84.5% vs 77.3%, p<0.001) and older (45.1% a룤65 vs. 17.8%, p<0.001). Controlling for demographics, physicians were less likely to complete suicide by firearm (aOR=0.60, 95%CI=0.51-0.71) but were more likely to suicide by overdose (aOR=1.41, 95%CI=1.13-1.77) or cutting (aOR=2.81, 95%CI=2.03-3.88). Physicians were more likely to have job related stressors (aOR=2.24, 95%Cl=1.83-2.74) and legal problems (aOR=2.34, 95%Cl=1.70-3.21).

We evaluated 117 SARS survivors from Toronto, Ontario. Patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, a 6-minute-walk test, quality-of-life measures, and self-report of health care utilization. At 1 year, informal caregivers were identified for a survey on caregiver burden. RESULTS The enrolled survivors of SARS were young (median age, 42 years), and most were women (67%) and health care workers (65%).

Surveillance protocols were extrapolated from published guidelines and applied to infrarenal EVAR patients active on local surveillance at a large, single centre. Surveillance intensity was dependent on presence of endoleak and subsequent risk of treatment failure in accordance with surveillance recommendations. Estimates for each surveillance protocol were inclusive of a range of published incidences of endoleak, contrast associated acute kidney injury (AKI), and excess hospital bed days, and estimated for a hypothetical five year surveillance period. RESULTS The kappa coefficient between CDUS and CTA for detecting sac abnormalities was 0.68. Maximum five year surveillance cost estimates for the 289 active EVAR patients were 272 359 for SVS, 230 708 for ESVS, 643 802 for NICE, and 266 777 for local protocols, or 1 270, 1 076, 3 003, and 1 244 per patient. Differences in endoleak incidence accounted for a 1.1 to 1.4 fold increase in costs. AKI incidence accounted for a 3.3 to 6.2 fold increase in costs. CONCLUSION A combined CTA and CDUS EVAR surveillance protocol, with CTA reserved for early seal assessment and confirmatory purposes, provides an economical approach without compromising detection of sac abnormalities. AKI, as opposed to direct imaging costs, accounted for the largest differences in surveillance cost estimates.","output":"A Comparison of Computed Tomography Angiography and Colour Duplex Ultrasound Surveillance Post Infrarenal Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Financial Implications and Impact of Different International Surveillance Guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CD4 T follicular helper (T fh ) cells are important for the generation of long-lasting and specific humoral protection against viral infections The degree to which SARS-CoV-2 infection generates T fh cells and stimulates the germinal center response is an important question as we investigate vaccine options for the current pandemic Here we report that, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, adult rhesus macaques exhibited transient accumulation of activated, proliferating T fh cells in their peripheral blood on a transitory basis The CD4 helper cell responses were skewed predominantly toward a T h 1 response in blood, lung, and lymph nodes, reflective of the interferon-rich cytokine environment following infection We also observed the generation of germinal center T fh cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a corresponding early appearance of antiviral serum IgG antibodies but delayed or absent IgA antibodies Our data suggest that a vaccine promoting Th1-type Tfh responses that target the S protein may lead to protective immunity","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces germinal center responses with robust stimulation of CD4 T follicular helper cells in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Profiles in the widely used phenomenon of mobile online dating applications are characteristically reduced to condensed information mostly containing one or a few pictures.

We aimed to comprehensively investigate serum biomarker profiles (proteins, lipids, and miRNAs) to support the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis (<3 hours) were included. Blood samples were taken upon emergency room arrival and 1 month later. RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing of 18 samples (6 patients with anaphylaxis in both acute and nonacute condition, for 12 total samples, and 6 healthy controls) identified hsa-miR-451a to be elevated during anaphylaxis, which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR in the remaining cohort. The random forest classifier enabled us to classify anaphylaxis with high accuracy using a composite model. We identified tryptase, 9,11-PGF2, apolipoprotein A1, and hsa-miR-451a as serological biomarkers of anaphylaxis. These predictors qualified as serological biomarkers individually but performed better in combination. CONCLUSION: Unexpectedly, hsa-miR-451a was identified as the most relevant biomarker in our data set. We were also able to distinguish between patients with a history of anaphylaxis and healthy individuals with higher accuracy than any other available model.

The functional effect of the mutation was predicted with Mutation Tasting. The analysis of 5' splice site score was estimated with MaxEntScan. Changes in amino acid sequencing were predicted with Mutalyzer. The tertiary structures of the wild type and mutation-carrying protein were predicted by I-TASSER. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes from the proband, his mother and a healthy control. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression. Results The proband presented with severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, characteristic facies, seizures and cryptorchidism. A novel hemizygous duplication mutation in the ATRX gene in a splice site between exons 3 and 4, NM_000489: c.189+1dupG, was identified with WES in the proband. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the mutation was inherited from his mother, who carried a heterozygous mutation, while his father was not affected.

Given growing urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a critical need to assess the successes and challenges of implementing HIV testing, prevention and treatment interventions in these contexts. METHODS: We randomly selected a household-based sample of 1528 adult men (18C35) and women (18C24) living in 18 randomly selected communities in KZN, South Africa. After the baseline interview, communities were randomized to one of three intervention rollout arms in a stepped wedge design. At approximately 8-month intervals, the Asibonisane Community Responses Program (and in particular the implementation of Stepping Stones, a participatory HIV prevention program focused on strengthening relationships and communication) was rolled at by intervention phase. Using data from this evaluation, we describe levels and trends in HIV testing and treatment during follow-up, and we use fixed effects models to estimate the effects of participation in the program on testing. RESULTS: Study respondents reported high levels of economic insecurity and mobility, and men report various HIV risk behaviors including about 50% reporting multiple partnerships. About two-thirds of respondents (73% of women, 63% of men) had been tested for HIV in the last six months. Among those living with HIV, treatment levels were high at baseline, and almost universal by endline in 2019. Program participation led to a 17% increase in the probability of testing for women (p<0.05) but had no effect on testing for men due, in part, to the fact that the program did not reach men who were least likely to be tested, including those who had migrated recently, and those who had never been tested at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Near universal HIV treatment use demonstrates positive trends in access to some HIV services (including treatment as prevention) in these communities. Stepping Stones had positive effects on HIV testing for women, yet barriers to HIV testing remain, especially for men. Redoubled efforts to reach men with testing are vital for improving HIV outcomes for both men and their partners.","output":"What are we learning about HIV testing in informal settlements in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa?

Considering the virus' zoonotic potential, its genome nature (segmented RNA virus), its worldwide circulation in livestock and its role in bovine respiratory disease, an increased interest is given to IDV. However, few data are available on drivers of emergence of IDV. We first listed fifty possible drivers of emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine. As recently carried out for COVID-19 in pets (Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 2020), a scoring system was developed per driver and scientific experts (N = 28) were elicited to (a) allocate a score to each driver, (b) weight the drivers' scores within each domain and (c) weight the different domains among themselves. An overall weighted score was calculated per driver, and drivers were ranked in decreasing order. Drivers with comparable likelihoods to play a role in the emergence of IDV in ruminants and swine in Europe were grouped using a regression tree analysis. Finally, the robustness of the expert elicitation was verified. Eight drivers were ranked with the highest probability to play a key role in the emergence of IDV: current species specificity of the causing agent of the disease; influence of (il)legal movements of live animals (ruminants, swine) from neighbouring/European Union member states and from third countries for the disease to (re-)emerge in a given country; detection of emergence; current knowledge of the pathogen; vaccine availability; animal density; and transport vehicles of live animals. As there is still limited scientific knowledge on the topic, expert elicitation of knowledge and multi-criteria decision analysis, in addition to clustering and sensitivity analyses, are very important to prioritize future studies, starting from the top eight drivers.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence and microperimetry were performed at baseline and every 6-12 months. Baseline and annual change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry mean sensitivity (MS) and number of scotoma loci, residual ellipsoid zone (EZ) span and hyperautofluorescent ring (HAR) area were reported. Next-generation and Sanger sequencing were performed in available members. RESULTS 12 affected members from three generations were examined. Mean (SD, range) age at onset of symptoms was 11 (4.5, 4-19) years. MS declined steadily from the third decade and EZ span and HAR area declined rapidly during the second decade. Serial microperimetry showed negligible change in MS over 2-3 years. However, mean EZ span, near-infrared and short-wavelength HAR area reduction was 203 (6.4%) m/year, 1.8 (8.7%) mm2/year and 1.1 (8.6%) mm2/year, respectively.

METHODS: We developed an epidemiologic model to evaluate allocation strategies defined by age and risk target groups, coverage, effectiveness and cost of vaccine. The model simulated hypothetical immunisation scenarios within a dynamic context, capturing concurrent public health strategies and population behavioural changes. RESULTS: In a scenario with 80% vaccine effectiveness, 40% population coverage and prioritisation of those over the age of 60 years at high risk of poor outcomes, active cases are reduced by 17% and net monetary benefit increased by $263 million dollars, relative to no vaccine. Concurrent implementation of policies such as school closure and senior contact reductions have similar impacts on incremental net monetary benefit ($352 vs $292 million, respectively) when there is no prioritisation given to any age or risk group. When older age groups are given priority, the relative benefit of school closures is much larger ($214 vs $118 million). Results demonstrate that the rank ordering of different prioritisation options varies by prioritisation criteria, vaccine effectiveness and coverage, and concurrently implemented policies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have three implications: (i) optimal vaccine allocation will depend on the public health policies in place at the time of allocation and the impact of those policies on population behaviour; (ii) outcomes of vaccine allocation policies can be greatly supported with interventions targeting contact reduction in critical sub-populations; and (iii) identification of the optimal strategy depends on which outcomes are prioritised.","output":"A Net Benefit Approach for the Optimal Allocation of a COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused huge impact on public health and significantly changed our lifestyle.

The effects of COVID-19 on patients presenting to the hospital with surgical complaints remain uncertain. Methods: A single tertiary center retrospective study analysis compared the ED attendance rate and severity of patients with surgical complaints between March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak) and pre-COVID-19 periods: February 2020 and the same 2 months in 2019 and 2018. Results: Overall, 6,017 patients were included. The mean daily ED visits of patients with nontrauma surgical complaints in the COVID-19 outbreak period declined by 27%-32% (P value <.01) compared with pre-COVID-19 periods. The log number of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in Israel in March 2020 was negatively correlated with the number of ED visits (Pearson's r = -0.59, P < .01). The proportion of patients requiring hospitalization increased by up to 8% during the outbreak period (P < .01), and there was a higher proportion of tachycardic patients (20% versus 15.5%, P = .01). The percentage of visits to the ED by men declined by 5% (P < .01). The ED diagnosis distribution significantly changed during COVID-19 (P = .013), with an 84% decrease in the number of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease (P < .05).

Some suggestions for drug treatment seem problematic. Beliefs about the causes of health problems are determinants of treatment seeking decisions. Hence, one of the alternatives for the solution of health problems is employing traditional medicine to prevent coronavirus disease 19. OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitude, and utilization of drugs toward the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic among Bale zone residents. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the Bale Zone population from May 30 to June 30, 2020. Eight hundred fifty-four participants were selected using a single population formula, and a multistage sampling technique was employed. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Descriptive and binary logistic regression was used to analyze the outcomes. A p value ? 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of the total 854 respondents, about 534 (62.5%) got information about coronavirus disease 19 from TV/radio. More than two-thirds (71.9%) of the respondents have known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has no curative drugs, and 65.4% had a more appropriate attitude toward overall drug use in coronavirus disease 19. Level of education and, attitude towards drug use were singnificantly associated with knowledge of drugs, source of information about coronavirus disease 19 and having good practice were significantly associated with atittude toward drug utilization. CONCLUSION: One out of two study participants have good knowledge regarding drugs to the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic. Illiterate people in the community were identified to have poor knowledge about drugs, hence community educuation program is important to improve the knowledge about drugs towards the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and utilization of drugs toward COVID-19 pandemic among Bale Zone residents, Southeast Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The quality of the surveillance system can be defined by attributes such as completeness, timeliness, usefulness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and reliability.

METHODS: A single-center review of protocols and practices designed to limit COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS: All patients were tested within 72 hours prior to the procedure with a COVID-19 nasal swab to assess for active disease. A distance of 6 ft between each stretcher and the staff within the ASC was maintained when possible. Preoperative anesthetizing and dilating eye drops were administered from multiuse bottles without contact with surfaces. Surgical cases were restarted at a reduced capacity of a maximum of 7 per day to distance patient arrivals. Removal of waiting room chairs and the creation of new break areas allowed for social distancing.

Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, reaction-diffusion, spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection heat-maps show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters. Application of our model in different countries can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areassuch as those underway in a few countries.","output":"Epidemiological model for the inhomogeneous spatial spreading of COVID-19 and other diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A partir de una aproximacin cualitativa que destaca los relatos de las trabajadoras de la industria del fruto rojo en la provincia de Huelva, Andaluca (Espa?a), este artculo explora la manera como el sistema de produccin a gran escala reduce costos mediante la vulneracin de los derechos laborales, econmicos, sociales y habitacionales de las trabajadoras y los trabajadores locales y migrantes marroques y africanos.

Stool samples from the breastfed infants were collected 21 days after mothers' second vaccination. Prepandemic samples of milk, dried blood spots, and infant stool were used as controls. Milk, dried blood spots, and infant stool were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for receptor-binding domain (RBD)Cspecific immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG. Milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the spike and four variants of concern: D614G, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P.1). Levels of 10 cytokines were measured in milk samples. RESULTS: Milk from COVID-19-immunized women neutralized the spike and four variants of concern, primarily driven by anti-RBD IgG. The immune response in milk also included significant elevation of interferon-. The immune response to maternal vaccination was reflected in breastfed infants: anti-RBD IgG and anti-RBD IgA were detected in 33% and 30% of infant stool samples, respectively. Levels of anti-RBD antibodies in infant stool correlated with maternal vaccine side effects. Median antibody levels against RBD were below the positive cutoffs in prepandemic milk and infant stool samples. CONCLUSION: Humoral and cellular immune responses to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination are present in most womens breast milk. The milk anti-RBD antibodies can neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike and variants of concern. Anti-RBD antibodies are transferred to breastfed infants, with the potential to confer passive immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Neutralizing Antibodies and Cytokines in Breast Milk After Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Understanding patients' hematologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to doing their prognosis, so adjusting care and improving outcomes. Objective: In this review, we aim at summarizing changes in the hematopoietic system and hemostasis that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Findings: COVID-19 infection is often associated with laboratory hematologic features that can have important clinical implications. Careful revision of baseline hematologic data at diagnosis can predict the severity of illness and help clinicians tailoring the approach and management of patients whose condition can be guarded or critical. The levels of hematologic markers like D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, viral load, inflammatory cytokines, differential blood cell count, and peripheral smear are fundamental for the prognosis. Studies have also shown an association between some of these markers and severe COVID-19 infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, so far, a vaccine is not available, prevention of the infection is based on the avoiding people affected and the spreading of the virus; the treatment, in the absence of an effective antiviral agent, is symptomatic, and, in addition to oxygen support, finds in the anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation fundamental therapeutic lines. According to the American Society of Hematology (ASH), all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patient: from a Hematologist's Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Identifying the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Currently, medical and dental practitioners can refer patients to be seen urgently within two weeks. The appropriateness of these referrals has been disputed. In 2020, the Department of Health aims for patients to be given cancer diagnoses within 28 days from referral. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted for all patients referred under the two-week wait pathway in a six-month period. In the first cycle of this audit, one month's worth of urgent referrals were analysed; given the small sample size, very few recommendations could be made. The audit cycle was repeated and it analysed six months' worth of data, which gave a much more representative study. All patients were analysed to see if the 14-day period had been breached. Positive cancer patients were further assessed to see if their diagnosis had been given within 28 days and treatments within 62 days. Results Of the 569 patients seen, there was a positive malignancy diagnostic yield of 7.38%. Nineteen patients breached the 14-day wait. Of the positive patients, 45.2% received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral, and 22.2% of these patients received treatment after 62 days. Conclusion The department performed well despite the high number of referrals. This audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article. Furthermore, this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among GDPs and GMPs. While all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view, this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions. All secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit.","output":"An audit to analyse the two-week wait pathway at an oral cancer specialist district general hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"How pandemic pressure is re-engineering clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Europe, for more than three millennia, the development of individual disciplines has been accompanied by the evolution of sports facilities.

This review addresses this issue and examines the fate of coronaviruses (CoVs) in water systems, with particular attention to the recently available information on the novel SARS-CoV-2. The methods for the determination of viable virus particles and quantification of CoVs and, in particular, of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are discussed with particular regard to the methods of concentration and to the emerging methods of detection. The analysis of the environmental stability of CoVs, with particular regard of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficacy of the disinfection methods are extensively reviewed as well. This information provides a broad view of the state-of-the-art for researchers involved in the investigation of CoVs in aquatic systems, and poses the basis for further analyses and discussions on the risk associated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water media. The examined data indicates that detection of the virus in wastewater and natural water bodies provides a potentially powerful tool for quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) and for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the evaluation of the level of circulation of the virus in a population. Assays of the viable virions in water media provide information on the integrity, capability of replication (in suitable host species) and on the potential infectivity.

With the recent advances in Future Internet design, multiple new network architectures, especially Information-Centric Networks (ICN) have emerged. Given the ubiquity of networks based on the Internet Protocol (IP), it is likely that we will have a number of different interconnecting network domains with different architectures, including ICNs. Their interoperability is important, but at the same time difficult to prove. A formal tool can be helpful for such analysis. ICNs have a number of unique characteristics, warranting formal analysis, establishing properties that go beyond, and are different from, what have been used in the state-of-the-art because ICN operates at the level of content names rather than node addresses. We need to focus on node-to-content reachability, rather than node-to-node reachability. In this paper, we present a formal approach to model and analyze information-centric interoperability (ICI).

It can be seen from previous researches, the DL model formation used only a single frequency sampling of the specific device. Besides, each electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition dataset produces a different length and sampling frequency to ensure sufficient precision of the RCR intervals to determine the heart rate variability (HRV). An accurate HRV is the gold standard for predicting the AF condition; therefore, a current challenge is to determine whether a DL approach can be used to analyze raw ECG data in a broad range of devices. This paper demonstrates powerful results for end-to-end implementation of AF detection based on a convolutional neural network (AFibNet). The method used a single learning system without considering the variety of signal lengths and frequency samplings. For implementation, the AFibNet is processed with a computational cloud-based DL approach. This study utilized a one-dimension convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) model for 11,842 subjects. It was trained and validated with 8232 records based on three datasets and tested with 3610 records based on eight datasets. The predicted results, when compared with the diagnosis results indicated by human practitioners, showed a 99.80% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULT: Meanwhile, when tested using unseen data, the AF detection reaches 98.94% accuracy, 98.97% sensitivity, and 98.97% specificity at a sample period of 0.02 seconds using the DL Cloud System. To improve the confidence of the AFibNet model, it also validated with 18 arrhythmias condition defined as Non-AF-class. Thus, the data is increased from 11,842 to 26,349 instances for three-class, i.e., Normal sinus (N), AF and Non-AF. The result found 96.36% accuracy, 93.65% sensitivity, and 96.92% specificity.

In past years, most of the high-throughput studies on H5N1-host interactions have focused on the host transcriptomic response, at the cellular or the lung tissue level. These studies pointed out that the dynamics and magnitude of the innate immune response and immune cell infiltration is critical to H5N1 pathogenesis. However, viral-host interactions are multidimensional and advances in technologies are creating new possibilities to systematically measure additional levels of omic data (e.g. proteomic, metabolomic, and RNA profiling) at each temporal and spatial scale (from the single cell to the organism) of the host response. Natural host genetic variation represents another dimension of the host response that determines pathogenesis. Systems biology models of H5N1 disease aim at understanding and predicting pathogenesis through integration of these different dimensions by using intensive computational modeling. In this review, we describe the importance of omic studies for providing a more comprehensive view of infection and mathematical models that are being developed to integrate these data.

Analysis included one-sided binomial exact tests and multiple linear, Poisson, and Beta regression models. RESULTS: The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min (10%).

Some studies have demonstrated more severe diseases in adults, but critically ill pediatric patients have been described in all ages. Pulmonary involvement is the major feature, and ventilatory support is common in critical cases. Nevertheless, other very important therapeutic approaches must be considered. In this article, we reviewed extensively all recent medical literature to point out the main clinical attitudes to support these pediatric patients during their period in respiratory support. Radiologic findings, fluid therapy, hemodynamic support, use of inotropic/vasopressors, nutritional therapy, antiviral therapy, corticosteroids, antithrombotic therapy, and immunoglobulins are analyzed to guide all professionals during hospitalization.

This has historically been accomplished with patient contact and bureaucratic aggregation, which tends to be slow and expensive. Recent internet-based approaches promise to be real-time and cheap, with few parameters. However, the question of when and how these approaches work remains open. We addressed this question using Wikipedia access logs and category links. Our experiments, replicable and extensible using our open source code and data, test the effect of semantic article filtering, amount of training data, forecast horizon, and model staleness by comparing across 6 diseases and 4 countries using thousands of individual models. We found that our minimal-configuration, language-agnostic article selection process based on semantic relatedness is effective for improving predictions, and that our approach is relatively insensitive to the amount and age of training data. We also found, in contrast to prior work, very little forecasting value, and we argue that this is consistent with theoretical considerations about the nature of forecasting. These mixed results lead us to propose that the currently observational field of internet-based disease surveillance must pivot to include theoretical models of information flow as well as controlled experiments based on simulations of disease.","output":"Measuring Global Disease with Wikipedia: Success, Failure, and a Research Agenda."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is known for decades that viruses from the Coronoviridae family can adapt to human-to-human transmission.

Here, we made use of a polysaccharide-adjuvanted vaccine approach to elicit resident pulmonary T cells to protect against aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Intratracheal administration of the multistage fusion protein CysVac2 and the delta-inulin adjuvant Advax? (formulated with a TLR9 agonist) provided superior protection against aerosol M. tuberculosis infection in mice, compared to parenteral delivery. Surprisingly, removal of the TLR9 agonist did not impact vaccine protection despite a reduction in cytokine-secreting T cell subsets, particularly CD4(+)IFN-(+)IL-2(+)TNF(+) multifunctional T cells. CysVac2/Advax-mediated protection was associated with the induction of lung-resident, antigen-specific memory CD4(+) T cells that expressed IL-17 and RORT, the master transcriptional regulator of Th17 differentiation. IL-17 was identified as a key mediator of vaccine efficacy, with blocking of IL-17 during M. tuberculosis challenge reducing phagocyte influx, suppressing priming of pathogen-specific CD4(+) T cells in local lymph nodes and ablating vaccine-induced protection. These findings suggest that tuberculosis vaccines such as CysVac2/Advax that are capable of eliciting Th17 lung-resident memory T cells are promising candidates for progression to human trials.","output":"Mucosal delivery of a multistage subunit vaccine promotes development of lung-resident memory T cells and affords interleukin-17-dependent protection against pulmonary tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poxviruses identified in skin lesions of domestic, pet or wild birds are assigned largely by default to the Avipoxvirus genus within the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of the family Poxviridae. Avipoxviruses have been identified as the causative agent of disease in at least 232 species in 23 orders of birds. Vaccines based upon attenuated avipoxvirus strains provide good disease control in production poultry, although with the large and intensive production systems there are suggestions and real risks of emergence of strains against which current vaccines might be ineffective. Sequence analysis of the whole genome has revealed overall genome structure and function resemblance to the Chordopoxvirinae; however, avipoxvirus genomes exhibit large-scale genomic rearrangements with more extensive gene families and novel host range gene in comparison with the other Chordopoxvirinae. Phylogenetic analysis places the avipoxviruses externally to the Chorodopoxvirinae to such an extent that in the future it might be appropriate to consider the Avipoxviruses as a separate subfamily within the Poxviridae. A unique relationship exists between Fowlpox virus (FWPV) and reticuloendothelosis viruses. All FWPV strains carry a remnant long terminal repeat, while field strains carry a near full-length provirus integrated at the same location in the FWPV genome. With the development of techniques to construct poxviruses expressing foreign vaccine antigens, the avipoxviruses have gone from neglected obscurity to important vaccine vectors in the past 20 years. The seminal observation of their utility for delivery of vaccine antigens to non-avian species has driven much of the interest in this group of viruses. In the veterinary area, several recombinant avipoxviruses are commercially licensed vaccines. The most successful have been those expressing glycoprotein antigens of enveloped viruses, e.g. avian influenza, Newcastle diseases and West Nile viruses. Several recombinants have undergone extensive human clinical trials as experimental vaccines against HIV/AIDS and malaria or as treatment regimens in cancer patients.

A survey of 373 frontline staffers and 74 team leaders in the integrated resorts (IRs) was conducted in three waves: April (Time 1), May (Time 2) and June (Time 3) in 2020. The data were analysed with SPSS and Mplus using a hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) method. Findings - The results indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, a busy mindset increased frontline staff's anxiety and thus decreased their subjective happiness, and leader conscientiousness remedied the effect of anxiety on subjective happiness. Practical implications - The findings are relevant to frontline staffers, team leaders in the hospitality industry and corporate service departments. Against the background of COVID-19, conscientious leaders can significantly help employees to overcome their anxiety and insecurity and improve their subjective happiness, answering the urgent call to deal with the challenges of the new work-life environment.

The aim of our study is to highlight the predictive value of some biochemical markers at hospitalization, for the correct classification of the patient in the form of disease. Methods: We performed an analytical retrospective study on 82 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the emergency department, with moderate or severe form of disease, and treated in our tertiary hospital. We analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics, symptomatology and biochemical values and compare the data according to the form of disease. Results: The mean age at admission was 4.5 years (median 1 year) and the masculine/feminine ratio was 1.5. Comparing the data between the two groups of patients (42 severe/40 moderate), we observed that the severe form presented with a lower pH at admission (p = 0.02), hyperglycemia (p = 0.01), increased values of transaminases (p = 0.01 and 0.02) and hypoproteinemia (p = 0.01). Also, the severe form was statistically significantly associated with comorbidities, acute respiratory distress, rising of the inflammatory markers during hospitalization. Hyperlactatemia (Lactate > 1.5 mmol/L) was significantly associated with the age under one year (p < 0.001). Mortality rate was 9.75% and the median age at death was 3 months.

Although heat sensitivity is a recognized clinical feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, few studies have examined the implications of climate change for patients with this disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals with MS ages 18C64 years in a nationwide United States patient-level commercial and Medicare Advantage claims database from 2003 to 2017. We defined anomalously warm weather as any month in which local average temperatures exceeded the long-term average by 1.5C. We estimated the association between anomalously warm weather and MS-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits using generalized log-linear models. From 75,395,334 individuals, we identified 106,225 with MS. The majority were women (76.6%) aged 36C55 years (59.0%). Anomalously warm weather was associated with increased risk for emergency department visits (risk ratio [RR] = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.025C1.063) and inpatient visits (RR = 1.032, 95% CI: 1.010C1.054). There was limited evidence of an association between anomalously warm weather and MS-related outpatient visits (RR = 1.010, 95% CI: 1.005C1.015). Estimates were similar for men and women, strongest among older individuals, and exhibited substantial variation by season, region, and climate zone. Limitations of the present study include the absence of key individual-level measures of socioeconomic position (i.e., race/ethnicity, occupational status, and housing quality) that may determine where individuals liveand therefore the extent of their exposure to anomalously warm weatheras well as their propensity to seek treatment for neurologic symptoms.

This has meant a significant reduction of the routine practice in Urology, as in other medical specialities, limiting the medical attention tourgent and emergent cases. Programmed activity has been reserved for selected cases in which a delayed attention could compromise survival. Different scientific associations have made a significant effort to adapt their recommendations to the pandemic, prioritizing high-risk oncologic cases, and reducing the use of ventilators and hospital stays to the minimum. These restrictions must be dynamic, adapting to the de-escalating phases as the pandemic is more controlled, widening the range of services available. In this de-escalate there is an additional challenge, being the difficulty in generating quality scientific evidence.

There was 92.9% agreement between ssRT-PCR and npRT-PCR (exact 95% CI of 88.4% to 96.1%;Cohens Kappa of 0.6435). If npRT-PCR will be assumed as reference standard, the estimated Sensitivity was 83.3% (exact 95% CI of 60.8% to 94.2%), Specificity 93.9% (exact 95% CI of 89.3% to 96.5%), Positive predictive value of 57.7% (exact 95% CI of 38.9% to 74.5%), Negative predictive value of 98.2% (exact 95% CI of 95% to 99.4%), positive likelihood ratio of 3.65 (95% CI of 7.37 to 24.9), negative likelihood ratio of 0.178 (95% CI of 0.063 to 0.499). There was 84.84% agreement (95% exact CI of 79.1% to 89.5%;Cohens Kappa of 0.2356) between ssLFAvs npRT-PCR, sensitivity of 38.9% (exact 95% CI of 20.3% to 61.4%), specificity of 89.4% (exact 95% CI of 84.1% to 93.1%), PPV of 26.9% (95% CI of 13.7% to 46.1%), NPV of 93.6% (exact 95% CI of 88.8% to 96.4%), LR+ of 3.67 (95% CI of 1.79 - 7.51), LR C of 0.68 (95% CI of 0.47 - 0.99). Conclusion. Our data showed that snort-spit saliva RT-PCR testing had acceptable diagnostic performance characteristics and can potentially be used as an alternative to the standard nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR test for COVID-19 in certain situations. However, our data also showed that snort-spit saliva antigen testing using lateral flow assay did not offer acceptable performance. ? 2021 University of the Philippines Manila.

The pandemic wreaked havoc on their already unfavorable situation. The direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 included but not limited to illness and deaths of food systems' workers, interruption of food supply chains, unemployment, depreciation of currency value, and disruption of social protection programs. COVID-19 will lead to further economic fallout. Thus, the situation needs careful observation and timely intervention to safeguard the vulnerable African communities. Although Africa has sought ways to lessen the dire impact of the pandemic on food security, short-term solutions should include and enhance social and economic relief initiatives such as monetary intervention and social safety net. Considering a balance between health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions and their economic implications, the African countries, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. Africa's medium- and long-term strategies for improving food security should include improving and diversifying its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities. This will reduce Africa's dependence on importation of these key commodities, and will help the continent address underlying economic vulnerabilities and better manage food, pandemic, and/or health-related crises affecting food security in the long term.","output":"Food Security and COVID-19 in Africa: Implications and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this short communication is to outline our experience in policies and processes of a nuclear medicine service during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore.

In this study, drug repurposing candidates were screened by in silico molecular docking simulation with the SARS-CoV-2 structural N protein. In the ChEMBL database, 1994 FDA-approved drugs were selected for the in silico virtual screening against the N terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The tyrosine 109 residue in the NTD of the N protein was used as the center of the ligand binding grid for the docking simulation. In plaque forming assays performed with SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells, atovaquone, abiraterone acetate, and digoxin exhibited a tendency to reduce the size of the viral plagues without affecting the plaque numbers. Abiraterone acetate significantly decreased the accumulation of viral particles in the cell culture supernatants in a concentration-dependent manner.

It is increasingly evident that wireless monitoring allows patients to be followed more easily, detecting complications early at home and allowing to limit the contagion of healthcare personnel by reducing the interaction with patients in hospital rooms METHODS: A pilot Multicenter Open-label Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was performing comparing wearable wireless vital parameters continuous monitoring (WVPCM) system and regular monitoring. Data were collected to provide a clinical-economic impact (costs, program effectiveness and QALY gains) of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units. Cost were estimated by mean of the identification, measuring and valorisation of the resources uptake. RESULTS: 143 patients (37 M/38 F, mean age: 78.7 years). Major complications: respiratory failure detection (6,5 vs 3,8); reduction of sudden deaths (9.3% vs 16% experimental); care-related infections (6,5 vs 7,5), glycemic decompensation (4,3 vs 1,9). Hospital readmission within 21 days were 7% vs 11%. Relevant cost driver was time spent by nurses: 58 minutes/day/patient (vs 132) allow to save 54-90/patient. One way and multiway sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results with nearly 99% of the replications involved CONCLUSIONS: WVPCM, detecting early complication during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, may facilitate a timely response ensuring a more appropriate management of complex patients seen (>25% of total admissions), reduce the time to diagnosis, improve efficiency/efficacy of disease management and reduce unnecessary clinic visits and hospital (re)admissions. The miniaturized technologies can improve patient adherence and assure better quality of life.

Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID\\\\19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self\\\\report measures of perceived threat of COVID\\\\19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID\\\\19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID\\\\19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID\\\\19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness.

These tactics also violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. This study identified marketing tactics of BMS companies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by reviewing promotional materials and activities from 9 companies in 14 countries, and the official Code reporting data from the Philippines. Eight qualitative themes emerged that indicate companies are capitalizing on fear related to COVID-19 by using health claims and misinformation about breastfeeding. Other promotional tactics such as donations and services were used to harness the public sentiment of hope and solidarity. Past studies show that these tactics are not new, but the pandemic has provided a new entry point, helped along by the unprecedented boom in digital marketing. There was a sharp increase of reported violations in the Philippines since the pandemic: 291 during the first months of the outbreak compared with 70 in all of 2019, corroborating the thematic findings. A lack of public awareness about the harm of donations and inadequate Code implementation and enforcement have exacerbated these problems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, patients with RT-PCR test positive in the first nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were accepted as true positive, and patients with negative 3 consecutive swab results were considered true negative. Those who had a negative initial swab were considered false negatives if they subsequently tested positive on the second or third swab. Demographic data of the patients, the onset of the disease, presence of nasal septal deviation, presence of epistaxis, the clinician (otolaryngologist/other physicians [OP]) who collected the samples, and medical treatments for laryngopharyngeal reflux, allergic respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis, which include proton pump inhibitors and nasal steroids (NS), were documented. The analysis of dependent variables was performed with the chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was performed for significant variables. RESULTS A total of 399 patients were included in the study, and 357 (89.5%) patients were detected as positive after 2 or 3 consecutive RT-PCR tests. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, and collecting the samples within 7 days following the onset of symptoms were determined as significant factors for positive RT-PCR results (P = <.001; odds ratio [OR] = 6.2, 5.8, 11.6, respectively).

METHODS: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. Services location, IVIs scheduling, utilization of staff, data recording methods, ophthalmic examination and surgical procedures were analysed; a new Intravitreal Injection Centre (IVIC) was developed according to Lean principles. Mean number of daily IVIs performed, mean time between registration and discharge, mean turnover time in between patients, percentages of performed IVIs on the monthly scheduled IVIs and of patients rating their experience ?8/10 via standardized feedback questionnaires were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The mean IVIs number per day increased from 20  4.08 to 50  7.07, and the mean time between registration and discharge of a patient decreased from 240  14.14 to 60  8.16 min (p = 0.00057 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Mean turnover time in between patients decreased from 10  1.41 to 8  2 min (p = 0.055).

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) between postnatal days 0C4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","output":"Neonatal hyperoxia enhances age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sport governing bodies have played a special role in society during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most prior studies of companions in clinical encounters focus on non-Hispanic White patients. However, there is generally lower-quality patient-physician communication during encounters with Black patients; these communication differences may contribute to racial health disparities. The purpose of the present study was to examine effects of the presence and active participation of companions on encounters between Black patients with cancer and non-Black oncologists. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data collected during a larger intervention study. Participants were Black patients with breast, colon, or lung cancer who had a treatment-discussion encounter with a participating non-Black medical oncologist. Video recordings of encounters were coded for patient, companion, and oncologist communication. After the encounter, patients reported perceptions of the recommended treatment; patients and oncologists reported perceptions of each other. RESULTS: Data from 114 patients and 19 oncologists were included in analyses. Only 47% of patients brought a companion to the encounter. Oncologists spent more time with accompanied Black patients, used more patient-centered communication with them, and perceived them as having more social support compared with unaccompanied Black patients. Oncologists reported that accompanied patients asked more questions. When companions participated more actively in the encounter, oncologists used more patient-centered communication. DISCUSSION: Bringing a companion to oncology appointments may be beneficial to Black patients because oncologists spend more time with patients, use more patient-centered communication, and perceive patients more positively, all of which may ultimately improve patient health and well-being outcomes.","output":"Impact of Patients' Companions on Clinical Encounters Between Black Patients and Their Non-Black Oncologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) produces a genome-length mRNA, mRNA 1, and six or seven species of subgenomic mRNAs in infected cells.

This M protein-mRNA 1 interaction most probably determines the selective packaging of mRNA 1 into MHV particles. A short cis-acting MHV RNA packaging signal is necessary and sufficient for packaging RNA into MHV particles. The present study tested the possibility that the selective M protein-mRNA 1 interaction is due to the packaging signal in mRNA 1. Regardless of the presence or absence of the packaging signal, N protein bound to MHV defective interfering RNAs and intracellularly expressed non-MHV RNA transcripts to form ribonucleoprotein complexes; M protein, however, interacted selectively with RNAs containing the packaging signal. Moreover, only the RNA that interacted selectively with M protein was efficiently packaged into MHV particles. Thus, it was the packaging signal that mediated the selective interaction between M protein and viral RNA to drive the specific packaging of RNA into virus particles.

Contrary to the Old World mammarenavirus group, these viruses are not able to completely suppress the innate immune response and trigger a robust interferon (IFN)-I response via retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Nevertheless, pathogenic NW mammarenaviruses trigger a weaker IFN response than their nonpathogenic relatives do. RIG-I activation leads to upregulation of a plethora of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which exert a characteristic antiviral effect either as lone effectors, or resulting from the combination with other ISGs or cellular factors. The dsRNA sensor protein kinase receptor (PKR) is an ISG that plays a pivotal role in the control of the mammarenavirus infection. In addition to its well-known protein synthesis inhibition, PKR further modulates the overall IFN-I response against different viruses, including mammarenaviruses. For this study, we employed Tacaribe virus (TCRV), the closest relative of the human pathogenic JUNV. Our findings indicate that PKR does not only increase IFN-I expression against TCRV infection, but also affects the kinetic expression and the extent of induction of Mx1 and ISG15 at both levels, mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, TCRV fails to suppress the effect of activated PKR, resulting in the inhibition of a viral titer. Here, we provide original evidence of the specific immunomodulatory role of PKR over selected ISGs, altering the dynamic of the innate immune response course against TCRV. The mechanisms for innate immune evasion are key for the emergence and adaptation of human pathogenic arenaviruses, and highly pathogenic mammarenaviruses, such as JUNV or MACV, trigger a weaker IFN response than nonpathogenic mammarenaviruses. Within the innate immune response context, PKR plays an important role in sensing and restricting the infection of TCRV virus. Although the mechanism of PKR for protein synthesis inhibition is well described, its immunomodulatory role is less understood. Our present findings further characterize the innate immune response in the absence of PKR, unveiling the role of PKR in defining the ISG profile after viral infection. Moreover, TCRV fails to suppress activated PKR, resulting in viral progeny production inhibition.","output":"The Protein Kinase Receptor Modulates the Innate Immune Response against Tacaribe Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated the public health and economy outcomes of different levels of social distancing to control a second wave outbreak in Australia and identify implications for public health management of COVID-19. METHODS: Individual-based and compartment models were used to simulate the effects of different social distancing and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. These models were used to evaluate the effects of different social distancing levels and the early relaxation of suppression measures, in terms of public health and economy outcomes. RESULTS: The models, fitted to observations up to July 2020, yielded projections consistent with subsequent cases and showed that better public health outcomes and lower economy costs occur when social distancing measures are more stringent, implemented earlier and implemented for a sufficiently long duration. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs. CONCLUSIONS: Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.","output":"Epidemiological modelling of the health and economic effects of COVID-19 control in Australias second wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AlphaFold changed the field of structural biology by achieving three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction from protein sequence at experimental quality.

We found a very weak or no correlation between AlphaFold output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence. Our results imply that AlphaFold cannot be immediately applied to other problems or applications in protein folding.","output":"Using AlphaFold to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability and function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: Learning management systems (LMS) are the most popular educational technology system used in distance education In our study, it was aimed to evaluate the acceptance levels of Suleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine students regarding the learning management system Methods: Learning management system acceptance scale (LMSAS) developed by Sezer was preferred for the study The scale was delivered to all students online, 941 students expressed their opinions (n: 941) Results: In the analysis of scale scores for all students, performance expectation for students is 22 70 +/- 9 48, effort expectation is 15 50 +/- 5 79, facilitating situations 14 92 +/- 5 61, social impact 6 70 +/- 3 37 and total score It was measured as 59 84 +/- 21 61 In comparing the preclinic and clinic years, it was seen that there was a statistically significant difference between the preclinical students and the clinical students in both total scores and all sub dimensions Conclusion: In the analysis of scale scores for all students, performance expectation, effort expectation, facilitating situations, social impact and total score are evaluated at the \\"medium\\" level for our students As a result, we believe that the addition of informative and awareness-raising activities related to the LMS within the education program will increase the students' intention to use a technological innovation in order to improve the acceptance level of the pre-graduate medical education program of the Suleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine, which has started the distance education process during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Evaluation of learning management system in medical education in time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), likely a bat-origin coronavirus, spilled over from wildlife to humans in China in late 2019, manifesting as a respiratory disease Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread initially within China and then globally, resulting in a pandemic","output":"Modelling scenarios of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected health care systems at different levels with important consequences on health, economy, and social structures. This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. METHODS: The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. RESULTS: The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time.","output":"Operating room efficiency and timing during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in a referral orthopaedic hospital in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in four bat species: Rhinolophus acuminatus, Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus malayanus, and Rhinolophus shameli. Here, we analysed 343 sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (CO1) from georeferenced bats of the four Rhinolophus species identified as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses. Haplotype networks were constructed in order to investigate patterns of genetic diversity among bat populations of Southeast Asia. No strong geographic structure was found for the four Rhinolophus species, suggesting high dispersal capacity. The ecological niche of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses was predicted using the four localities of bat SARS-CoV-2-like viruses and the localities where bats showed identical or very similar CO1 haplotypes than virus-positive bats. The ecological niche of SARS-CoV-like viruses was deduced from the localities where bat SARS-CoV-like viruses were previously detected. The results show that the ecological niche of SARS-CoV2-like viruses includes several regions of mainland Southeast Asia whereas that of SARS-CoV-like viruses is mainly restricted to China. In agreement with these results, human populations in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand appear to be much less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic than other countries of Southeast Asia. In the climatic transitional zone between the two ecological niches (southern Yunnan, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and possibly Hainan and Taiwan), genomic recombination between highly divergent viruses is more likely to occur.

This study was focused on developing a decision-support tool to help infusion centres plan their operations. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model (ENTIMOS) was developed using Simul8 software in collaboration with clinical experts. Model inputs included treatment-specific clinical parameters, resources such as infusion chairs and nursing staff, and costs, while model outputs included patient throughput, waiting time, queue size, resource utilisation, and costs. The model was parameterised using characteristics of the Charing Cross Hospital Infusion Centre in London, UK, where 12 infusion chairs were deployed for 170 non-MS and 860 MS patients as of March 2021. The number of MS patients was projected to increase by seven new patients per week. RESULTS: The model-estimated waiting time for an infusion is, on average, 8 days beyond clinical recommendation in the first year of simulation. Without corrective action, the delay in receiving due treatment is anticipated to reach 30 days on average at 30 months from the start of simulation. Such system compromise can be prevented either by adding one infusion chair annually or switching 7% of existing patients or 24% of new patients to alternative MS treatments not requiring infusion. CONCLUSION: ENTIMOS is a flexible model of patient flow and care delivery in infusion centres serving MS patients. It allows users to simulate specific local settings and therefore identify measures that are necessary to avoid clinically significant treatment delay resulting in suboptimal care.

Additionally, matched maternal and cord blood were collected from COVID-19 convalescent pregnancies. Although serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women, cellular immune analyses revealed marked differences in key NK cell and unconventional T cell responses during COVID-19 in pregnant women. While NK, æ T cells and MAIT cells displayed pre-activated phenotypes in healthy pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant age-matched women, activation profiles of these pre-activated NK and unconventional T cells remained unchanged at acute and convalescent COVID-19 in pregnancy. Conversely, activation dynamics of NK and unconventional T cells were prototypical in non-pregnant women in COVID-19. In contrast, activation of  CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, T follicular helper cells and antibody-secreting cells was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women with COVID-19.

In this paper we aim to broaden the scope of this discussion by considering the ethics of broader structural allocation decisions raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we consider how nations ought to distribute a scarce life-saving resource across healthcare regions in a public health emergency, particularly in view of regional differences in projected need and existing capacity. We call this the regional triage question. Using the case study of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic, we show how the moral frameworks that we might adopt in response to individual triage decisions do not translate straightforwardly to this regional-level triage question. Having outlined what we take to be a plausible egalitarian approach to the regional triage question, we go on to propose a novel way of operationalising the 'save the most lives' principle in this context.

Hence, the aims of this study were: to determine differences between PA levels with anxiety, mindfulness, and impulsiveness; to identify the predictive value of sociodemographic factors and physical activity, impulsivity, and mindfulness on anxiety factors; and to analyze the possible mediating effects of mindfulness on the relationship between impulsivity and anxiety. A total of 242 female athletes underwent an assessment of physical activity, anxiety, mindfulness traits, and impulsivity using validated questionnaires. Data were analyzed according to (1) individual or collective sport, and (2) PA levels according to energy expended (METs min/day). Participants were grouped by light, moderate, and vigorous PA levels. There were 30.5% elite athletes and 73.2% collective sports athletes.

Female athletes could suffer competitive anxiety, especially those who present higher levels of impulsivity. However, higher levels of mindfulness traits seem to be a protective factor in the effects of impulsivity on anxiety in this population and have demonstrated to be significant mediators in this association.

The disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased. ? There exists an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations. A practical resource allocation strategy is the prerequisite for disease control during a pandemic affected by various external factors, such as the information about the epidemic state, the interregional population mobility, and the geographical factors. Understanding the influence of these factors on resource allocation and epidemic spreading is the premise for designing an optimal resource allocation strategy. To this end, we study the interaction of resource allocation and epidemic spreading in the scope of the metapopulation model by incorporating the factors of geographic proximity, the information of the epidemic state, the willingness of resource allocation, and the population mobility simultaneously. We develop a mathematical framework based on the Markovian chain approach to analyze the dynamical system and obtain the epidemic threshold concerning external factors. Combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased in terms of the geographical factor during a pandemic. Specifically, the spreading size is the lowest, and the epidemic threshold is the largest when resources are allocated unbiasedly between neighbor nodes and other nodes. In addition, when studying the effects of resource allocation on the epidemic threshold, we find the same results, i.e., information-aware resource allocation with unbiased in terms of the geographical factor will raise the epidemic threshold. At last, we study the effects of mobility rate on the dynamical property and find an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations.

This study aimed to compare the utilisation of healthcare services for RTIs between individuals with and without diabetes attending primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Qatar. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic database of all individuals who had a diagnosis of RTI. SETTING: PHCCs in Qatar from July 2015 to December 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the study were all adult individuals (aged &#8805;18 years) who visited the primary healthcare facilities and were diagnosed with an RTI during the study period. PRIMARY AND OUTCOME MEASURES: For each participant, visits to the healthcare facility, antibiotic use and use of other medications were extracted from the electronic database and compared between participants with and without a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 32 857 participants were included, of whom 7407 (22.5%) had a diabetes diagnosis. Results from a negative binomial regression indicate that diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with increased visits to the healthcare facility (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.076 to 1.134, p<0.001), antibiotic use (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.046 to 1.145, p<0.001) and use of other medications (IRR 1.11, 95% CI 1.078 to 1.143, p<0.001).

(1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. Conclusion : COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"Telehealth and the COVID-19 Pandemic: International Perspectives and a Health Systems Framework for Telehealth Implementation to Support Critical Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged governments worldwide with the design of appropriate policies that maximize health outcomes while minimizing economic and mental health consequences.

We studied the specific case of Spanish regions and focused on bar and restaurant closures using data from a continuous voluntary web survey that we merged with information about region-specific policies that identified when and where bars and restaurants were closed. We estimated an endogenous binary-treatment-regression model and found that closing bars and restaurants had a significant negative impact on happiness. The results were statistically significant after controlling for the pandemic context, health, income, work, and other personal characteristics and circumstances. We interpreted the results in terms of the positive effect of socialization, individuals feelings of freedom, and the comparative nature of life satisfaction.","output":"Are Spaniards Happier When the Bars Are Open?

We examined the associations of quitting-related behaviors with perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in smokers. We conducted a telephone survey of 659 community-based adult smokers (81.7% male) in Hong Kong, where there was no lockdown. Exposure variables were perceptions that smoking can increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 (perceived susceptibility) and its severity if infected (perceived severity). Outcome variables were quit attempts, smoking reduction since the outbreak of the pandemic, and intention to quit within 30 days. Covariates included sex, age, education, heaviness of smoking, psychological distress, and perceived danger of COVID-19. High perceived susceptibility and severity were reported by 23.9% and 41.7% of participants, respectively. High perceived susceptibility was associated with quit attempts (prevalence ratio (PR) 2.22, 95% CI 1.41C3.49), smoking reduction (PR 1.75, 95% CI 1.21C2.51), and intention to quit (PR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40C3.84). Perceived severity of COVID-19 was associated with quit attempts (PR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01C2.67) but not with smoking reduction or intention to quit. To conclude, the perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in smokers were associated with quitting-related behaviors in current smokers, which may have important implications for smoking cessation amid the pandemic.","output":"High Perceived Susceptibility to and Severity of COVID-19 in Smokers Are Associated with Quitting-Related Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Africa's health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic.

To test the impact of product presentation features on customers visual attention, webcam eye tracking might be an alternative to infrared eye tracking, especially in situations where face-to-face contact is difficult. The aim of this study was to examine whether webcam eye tracking is suitable for investigating the influence of certain exogenous factors on customers visual attention when visiting online clothing shops. For this purpose, screenshots of two websites of two well-known online clothing retailers were used as stimuli. Linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the influence of the spatial position and the presence of a human model on the percentage of participants visiting a product depiction. The results show that products presented by human models and located in the upper middle area of a website were visited by more participants. From this, we were able to derive recommendations for optimising product presentation in online clothing shops.

Medical trainees fear disclosing psychological distress and rarely seek help. Social sharing of difficult experiences can reduce stress and burnout. Drawing comics is one way that has been used to help trainees express themselves. The authors explore reasons why some medical trainees chose to draw comics depicting stressful situations that they had never shared with anyone before. Methods. Trainees participated in a comic drawing session on stressors in medicine. Participants were asked if they had ever shared the drawn situation with anyone. Participants who had not previously shared were asked what prevented them and why they shared it now. The authors performed content analysis of the responses. Results. Of two hundred forty participants, forty-six (19.2%) indicated sharing an experience for the first time. Analysis of the responses revealed dedicated time and space was essential to sharing, trainee insecurity was a barrier, and comics were perceived as a safe way to communicate. Discussion. Depicting a stressful situation may be beneficial for trainees who drew an experience they had never shared before. Providing trainees with the opportunity to externalize their experience and create a community for sharing tough experiences may be one way to reduce trainee stress and burnout.","output":"Increase in Sharing of Stressful Situations by Medical Trainees through Drawing Comics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients often have pre-existing comorbidities, which can influence timeliness of cancer diagnosis. We examined symptoms, investigations and emergency presentation (EP) risk among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients by comorbidity status. METHODS: Using linked cancer registration, primary care and hospital records of 4836 CRC patients (2011C2015), and multivariate quantile and logistic regression, we examined variations in specialist investigations, diagnostic intervals and EP risk. RESULTS: Among colon cancer patients, 46% had at least one pre-existing hospital-recorded comorbidity, most frequently cardiovascular disease (CVD, 18%). Comorbid versus non-comorbid cancer patients more frequently had records of anaemia (43% vs 38%), less frequently rectal bleeding/change in bowel habit (20% vs 27%), and longer intervals from symptom-to-first relevant test (median 136 vs 74 days). Comorbid patients were less likely investigated with colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, independently of symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.7[0.6, 0.9] for Charlson comorbidity score 1C2 and OR = 0.5 [0.4C0.7] for score 3+ versus 0.

CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid individuals with as-yet-undiagnosed CRC often present with general rather than localising symptoms and are less likely promptly investigated with colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. Comorbidity is a risk factor for diagnostic delay and has potential, additionally to symptoms, as risk-stratifier for prioritising patients needing prompt assessment to reduce EP.","output":"Do presenting symptoms, use of pre-diagnostic endoscopy and risk of emergency cancer diagnosis vary by comorbidity burden and type in patients with colorectal cancer?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite recent successes in hand pose estimation from RGB images or depth maps, inherent challenges remain. RGB-based methods suffer from heavy self-occlusions and depth ambiguity.

The aforementioned challenges have inspired us to combine the two modalities to offset the shortcomings of the other. In this paper, we propose a novel RGB and depth information fusion network to improve the accuracy of 3D hand pose estimation, which is called CrossFuNet. Specifically, the RGB image and the paired depth map are input into two different subnetworks, respectively. The feature maps are fused in the fusion module in which we propose a completely new approach to combine the information from the two modalities. Then, the common method is used to regress the 3D key-points by heatmaps.

The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) is among the most frequently used instruments to assess perceptions of discrimination in general, as well as specific types of discrimination (e.g., based on race/ethnicity or age). While numerous studies attest to its validity and reliability for racial/ethnic minority groups, no existing study has examined its psychometric equivalence across gender, age, or socio-economic groups. This study fills this gap. HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that because social hierarchies of race/ethnicity, age, gender and class have different histories and are differently organized and institutionalized in contemporary United States, racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups differ in the types of discrimination they experience and perceive. As a result, the EDS may not be equivalent across these social groups. METHOD We test this hypothesis by analyzing data from the 2015 US Texas Diversity Study (N=1,049), a telephone survey of English- and Spanish-speaking adults. We examine two forms of the EDS - one focusing on discrimination regardless of attribution and one focusing specifically on discrimination attributed to respondents' race/ethnicity. RESULTS Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed that neither version of the scale generates estimates of discrimination that can be meaningfully compared across all racial/ethnic, age, gender, and education-based groups.

Their interaction indeed modifies the self-assembly propensity of the peptide that is at the origin of the deposition of insoluble peptide aggregates in the amyloid plaque, a hallmark found in AD brains. Another even more important fallout of the Cu binding to A peptide is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contributes to the overall oxidative stress detected in the disease and is due to the redox ability of the Cu ions. Many therapeutic approaches are currently developed to aid fighting against AD, one of them targeting the redox-active Cu ions. Along this research line, we report in the present article the use of a phenanthroline-based peptide-like ligand (L), which is able to withdraw Cu from A and redox-silence it in a very stable 4N Cu(II) binding site even in the presence of Zn(II). In addition and in contrast to what is usually observed, the presence of excess of L lessens the searched effect of ROS production prevention, but it is counterbalanced by the co-presence of Zn(II). To explain such unprecedented trends, we proposed a mechanism that involves the redox reaction between Cu(II)L and Cu(I)L2. We thus illustrated (i) how speciation and redox chemistry can weaken the effect of a ligand that would have appeared perfectly suitable if only tested in a 1:1 ratio and on CuA and (ii) how Zn overcomes the undesired lessening of ROS arrest due to excess of ligand. In brief, we have shown how working in biologically relevant conditions is important for the understanding of all of the reactions at play and this must be taken into consideration for the further rational design of ligands aiming to become drug candidates.","output":"Unexpected Trends in Copper Removal from A Peptide: When Less Ligand Is Better and Zn Helps."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the human primarily respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, commonly involves the nervous system, the effects of which may persist for many months.

In response to the pandemic, 17.9% of hospitals reported reduced in-person lactation support, and 72.9% reported discharging mothers and their newborns <48 hours after birth. Some of the infection prevention and control (IPC) practices that hospitals were implementing conflicted with evidence-based care to support breastfeeding. Mothers who are separated from their newborn or not feeding directly at the breast might need additional postdischarge breastfeeding support. In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that newborns discharged before 48 hours receive prompt follow-up with a pediatric health care provider.","output":"Implementation of Hospital Practices Supportive of Breastfeeding in the Context of COVID-19  United States, July 15CAugust 20, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shore power (SP) and emission control area (ECA) have been two of the main polices for a green maritime logistics. However, it is still not clear how the joint impact of these two polices will influence vessels' shipping and energy consumption plan. The influence could be more complicated at the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 when the vessel's refueling could be risky. This paper develops mathematical model of the vessel's routing and fuel inventory decisions by considering both the SP and ECA. Based on the model, we analyze the optimal decision of a vessel under three different policy conditions, which are non-SP, compulsive utilization of SP at all ports, and optional SP utilization by the vessel. The numerical experiments are conducted based on the information of a vessel delivering cargos along the coastline in China. The results uncover a novel phenomenon that the implementation of the SP might incentive the vessel to travel longer distance outside the ECA for a lower total cost that results in more pollutant emissions. We show that the SP policy would influence the vessel's fuel management and refueling times which can change the route of vessel sailing inside and outside ECAs. Sensitivity analysis also shed light on how the government's decision on the SP policy may influence the overall pollutant emissions of the vessel from both berthing at ports and sailing on the sea. We discussed how the fixed cost of refueling, which is affected by the risk of the COVID-19 condition, will influence the vessel's plan under the SP and ECA polices. This study suggests the government to make an integrated policy of both SP and ECA at the post-pandemic era to achieve an overall reduction of the pollutant emission.","output":"Are shore power and emission control area policies always effective together for pollutant emission reduction?

Furthermore, inguinal hernias are now considered to be one of the long-term complications of radical prostatectomy. In this report, we present our experience with the performance of totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) along with extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). PRESENTATION OF CASE A 66-year-old man with prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernias was admitted to our hospital for surgery. He had a history of right inguinal hernioplasty without mesh placement and ascending colon diverticulitis. With a diagnosis of prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernia, concomitant TEP after ELRP was safely performed. DISCUSSION TEP combined with ELRP appears to be a rational procedure and easy to perform. The incidence of complications related to either TEP or ELRP might not be increased. TEP combined with ELRP might be safely performed for recurrent inguinal hernia after non-mesh hernioplasty.

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic.

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiatives campaign involves a proportional framework to finance and distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. However, the COVAX framework has critical limitations, including limited funding and the failure to account for the special epidemic risks and needs of its participating nations, as recommended by the World Health Organizations Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization framework. These drawbacks disproportionately impact Africa, where many nations rely on COVAX as their main source of vaccines. The current plan to vaccinate only up to 20% of participating nations populations is short-sighted from both epidemiologic and moral perspectives. COVAX must commit to vaccinating all of Africa and its initiative must be modified to account for the health and economic infrastructures in these countries. Lessons learned from successful vaccination campaigns, including the West African Ebola outbreak, have shown that vaccinating all of Africa is possible and feasible, and that infrastructure and human resources can support mass vaccination. To halt this global pandemic, global responsibility must be accepted to finance and equitably distribute SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to African nations.

A reliable solution to prevent further damage, early diagnosis of coronavirus patients are incredibly important. While chest X-Ray diagnosis is the easiest and fastest solution for this, an average radiologist has only a 75% to 85% accuracy when evaluating X-Ray data, thus it is desirable to achieve an accurate artificial network for this. Throughout this study, chest X-Ray data and blood routine test data are utilised and compared. X-Ray data consists of 5000 chest X-Ray images which are gathered from an open-source research and from a local hospital in which both have anonymous data. The blood test results were also taken from the same hospital. For the chest X-Ray diagnosis we utilised two of the popular convolutional neural networks, which are Resnet18 and Squeezenet and concluded that Resnet18 provided slightly more accurate results, while both having almost 98% accuracy. For blood test diagnosis, a feed-forward multi layer neural network was used. Even though it was worked on an insufficient dataset, 72% accuracy was obtained, thus making it a feasible option for further research. Hence, we concluded that in general chest X-Ray diagnosis is preferable over routine blood test diagnosis and the usage of AI yields better approximate results than humans. ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Covid-19 Diagnosis: Comparative Approach Between Chest X-Ray and Blood Test Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus responsible for the outbreak of the respiratory disease COVID-19, which has spread to several countries around the world, causing considerable consternation and a fear of contagions in global healthcare settings.

This cross-sectional observational study involves 1,008 persons randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 2020. Their perceived vulnerability to disease was measured using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale. An additional questionnaire evaluated basic sociodemographic aspects, medical history, personal hygiene behavior, willingness to go to certain places and the perception of the risk of contagion when going to a dental practice. There are significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction ((p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings ((p < 0.05). Women consider the risk to be higher than men do. The risk group (over 60 and with systemic disease) has significant differences on the subscales of infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01).

Some groups of individuals may be more vulnerable than others, depending on factors such as preexisting conditions, personality, and past life experiences. Building on previous work on the potential long-term benefits of psychedelics, we hypothesized that lifetime use of these drugs could be linked to better mental health indicators in the context of the ongoing pandemic. Methods: Two anonymous online surveys were conducted between April 2020 and June 2020, including questions about lifetime experience with psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs, and psychometric scales designed to measure personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience. Principal component analysis was applied to divide the sample into groups of subjects based on their drug use reports. Results: 5618 participants (29.15 {+/-} 0.12 years, 71.97% female) completed both surveys and met the inclusion criteria, with 32.43% of the final sample reporting at least one use of a psychedelic drug. Lifetime psychedelic use was linked to increased openness and decreased conscientiousness, and with higher scores of positive affect. The reported number of past psychedelic experiences predicted higher scores of the secondary personality trait beta factor, which has been interpreted as a measure of plasticity. No significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and indicators of impaired mental health were observed. Conclusion: We did not find evidence of an association between lifetime use of psychedelics and poor mental health indicators. Conversely, experience with psychedelic drugs was linked to increased positive affect and to personality traits that favor resilience and stability in the light of the ongoing crisis. Future studies should be conducted to investigate these results from a causal perspective.

This information is essential if the chemical reactivity and physical properties of this important intermediate are to be understood. NNK diazonium ion is a well-known alkylating agent. Its enzymatic production, its reaction with DNA, and its role in mutagenesis/carcinogenesis have all received significant experimental study. Computational work on the ion, however, is lacking. The species is sufficiently small such that its properties may be probed using sophisticated model chemistries. We present the first in silico investigation of NNK diazonium ion. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (B3LYP/6-311G**) and coupled cluster theory (CCSD/6-31G*) were deployed to obtain energies, geometries, electrostatic potential surfaces, molecular orbitals, and vibrational analyses for several energy-minimized structures. To provide insight into the motion of NNK diazonium ion (NNKDI) in solution, molecular dynamics simulations on the solvated intermediate were undertaken. To explore the initial reactivity of this important electrophile, local Fukui indices and natural population analysis charges were predicted. Analogous ab initio work on propane diazonium ion was also performed. Our vibrational analyses suggest a relatively weak carbon-nitrogen bond and a robust nitrogen-nitrogen interaction.

SMART Recovery groups employ cognitive, behavioural and motivational principles and strategies to offer support for a range of addictive behaviours. COVID-19 fundamentally changed the way that these groups could be delivered. METHODS: A series of online meetings were conducted by the lead author (PK) and the SMART Recovery International Executive Officer (KM), with representatives from the SMART Recovery National Offices in the Ireland (DO), United States (MR), Australia (RM), and Denmark (BSH, DA), and the United Kingdom (AK). The meetings focused on discussing the impacts of COVID-19 on SMART Recovery in each of the regions. RESULTS: As a result of restrictions to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the vast majority of SMART Recovery face-to-face meetings were required to cease globally. To ensure people still had access to AOD mutual support, SMART Recovery rapidly scaled up the provision of online groups. This upscaling has increased the number of groups in countries that had previously provided a limited number of online meetings (i.e., United States, England, Australia), and has meant that online groups are available for the first time in Denmark, Ireland, Hong Kong, Spain, Malaysia and Brazil. DISCUSSION: Whilst the urgent and rapid expansion of online groups was required to support people during the pandemic, it has also created an opportunity for the ongoing availability of online mutual support post-pandemic.

RESULT: The comprehensive evaluation index had good fitness to that of single attribute (i.e. seed yield, crop quality and soil fertility), indicating that the comprehensive evaluation index was reliable. Applying controlled-release urea (rice in wheat and oilseed rape field: 150 kg N ha-1 , other crops: 120 kg N ha-1 ) plus common urea (30 kg N ha-1 ) incorporating straw from the previous season across the growing season for cereal and oilseed crops showed a slight improvement in seed productivity and Nuse efficiency among three cropping systems in the traditional evaluation method.

It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallires, & Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator.

To data, however, South Korea has no related social protection policies to replace income loss or prevent non-preferable health conditions for workers. In particular, there are several differences in social protection policies by gender or occupational groups. This study aimed to investigate how hospitalization affects income loss among workers in South Korea. METHODS: The study sample included 4876 Korean workers who responded to the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KoWePS) for all eight years from 2009 to 2016. We conducted a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to determine the cut-off point for the length of hospitalization that corresponded to the greatest loss of income. We used panel multi-linear regression to examine the relationship between hospitalization and income loss by gender and employment arrangement. RESULTS: The greatest income loss for women in non-standard employment and self-employed men was observed when the length of hospitalization was seven days or less. When they were hospitalized for more than 14 days, income loss also occurred among men in non-standard employment. In addition, when workers were hospitalized for more than 14 days, the impact of the loss of income was felt into the subsequent year. CONCLUSION: Non-standard and self-employed workers, and even female standard workers, are typically excluded from public insurance coverage in South Korea, and social security is insufficient when they are injured.

This study used Generalizability Theory to test the dependability of psychotherapy competence assessments based on video observation of trainees. A 10-item rating form was developed from a collection of forms used by graduate programs (n = 102) in counseling and clinical psychology, and a review of the common factors research literature. This form was then used by 11 licensed psychologists to rate eight graduate trainees while viewing 129, approximately 5-min video clips from their psychotherapy sessions with clients (n = 22) at a graduate program's training clinic. Generalizability analyses were used to forecast how the number of raters and clients, and length of observation time impact the dependability of ratings in various rating designs. Raters were the primary source of error variance in ratings, with rater main effects (leniency bias) and dyadic effects (rater-target interactions) contributing 24% and 7% of variance, respectively. Variance due to segments (video clips) was also substantial, suggesting that therapist performance varies within the same counseling session. Generalizability coefficients (G) were highest for crossed rating designs and reached maximum levels (G > .50) after four raters watched each therapist working with three clients and observed 15 min per dyad. These findings suggest that expert raters show consensus in ratings even without rater training and only limited direct observation. Future research should investigate the validity of competence ratings as predictors of outcome.

Unfortunately, newly emerged, fast-spreading strains of COVID-19 threaten to undermine progress by interfering with vaccine efficacy. While a long-term solution to this challenge would be to develop vaccines that simultaneously target multiple different COVID-19 variants, this approach faces both developmental and regulatory hurdles. A simpler option would be to switch the target of the current vaccine to better match the newest viral variant. I use a stochastic simulation to determine when it is better to target a newly emerged viral variant and when it is better to target the dominant but potentially less transmissible strain. My simulation results suggest that it is almost always better to target the faster spreading strain, even when the initial prevalence of this variant is much lower. In scenarios where targeting the slower spreading variant is best, all vaccination strategies perform relatively well, meaning that the choice of vaccination strategy has a small effect on public health outcomes. In scenarios where targeting the faster spreading variant is best, use of vaccines against the faster spreading viral variant can save many lives. My results provide rule of thumb guidance for those making critical decisions about vaccine formulation over the coming months.","output":"Viral Variants and Vaccinations: If We Can Change the COVID-19 Vaccine, Should We?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an inevitable result of Russias higher education policies of the past two decades, new university leaders in and outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg have emerged, and vertical differentiation has increased. Inequality of educational potential has a strong regional dimension, exerting a considerable delayed impact on regional socioeconomic development. Differences in universities resources affected their ability to adapt their instructional, research, and administrative processes during the pandemic, thus broadening the education and research quality gap in higher education. Some regions may face an increased outflow of youth talent to universities based in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that will certainly weaken the socioeconomic growth prospects of Russias regions. The pandemic accelerated the debate over this problem and demonstrated readiness of universities for joint efforts. This leads to an expansion of policy to create a cooperative network of universities and their stakeholders so as to reduce institutional differentiation and promote exchange of experience and competence among universities. This paper investigates into the main characteristics of vertical differentiation in Russian higher education that had been in place when the pandemic broke out and determined whether universities succeeded or failed in switching to distance learning. Furthermore, lockdown measures and their economic impact on different types of universities are analyzed. Finally, we discuss possible avenues and specific considerations for expanding cross-institutional collaboration and engaging stakeholders in university development. ? 2021, Mir Rossii.

METHODS: The studys protocol was based on a corpus of countries infected by COVID-19 and of which the linguistic repertoire includes a widely spoken language in individuals everyday communication. We tested whether languages with and without aspiration differ in terms of COVID-19 reproduction number, and whether the frequency of occurrence of stop consonants in several languages correlates with the virus reproduction number. RESULTS: The results demonstrated no significant effect of aspiration on the transmission of the virus, while a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence and transmissibility was observed only for the consonant /p/; this might suggest that languages that use /p/ more frequently might spread the virus more easily.

Asbestos was found to cause asbestosis some 100 years ago. Reports of carcinogenicity by Gloyne and Merewether were in the 1st Supplement of ILOs Encyclopaedia in 1938. Today all asbestos types have been classified as carcinogenic. Asbestos ban and measures to eliminate exposures to asbestos have been recorded by ILO in 2006, and WHO in 2007. The ILOs List of Occupational Diseases covers all asbestos-related diseases. Materials and Methods: Used historical, scientific, statistical data records and reports on asbestos-related outcomes and measures taken to eliminate exposures. Results: The present estimate on asbestos burden globally is 239,000 -243,223 deaths at work and 260.029 all deaths. The list of countries where asbestos use is banned contains 67 countries. Only a tiny fraction of diseases is recorded as asbestos-related and compensated. Covid-19 as a lung disease considerably contributes to serious negative health outcomes for asbestos-exposed workers. Conclusions: sbestos ban is not a financial burden and substitutes are available for all uses of asbestos. The EU banned asbestos in 2005 and the latest European Parliament decision requests for strong measures to prevent asbestos exposures in infrastructure, and a binding exposure limit of 1000 fibres/m3 at work.

One of the risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 is the level of expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in lung tissue. It is, however, not clear how lung tissue inflammation affects expression levels of these receptors. We hence aimed to determine the level of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in lung tissue of asthmatic relative to age, gender, and asthma severity, and to investigate the factors regulating that. Therefore, gene expression data sets of well-known asthmatic cohorts (SARP and U-BIOPRED) were used to evaluate the association of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with age, gender of the asthmatic patients, and also the type of the underlying lung tissue inflammatory cytokines. Notably, ACE2 and to less extent TMPRSS2 expression were upregulated in the lung tissue of asthmatics compared to healthy controls. Although a differential expression of ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 was observed relative to age within the moderate and severe asthma groups, our data suggest that age may not be a key regulatory factor of its expression. The type of tissue inflammation, however, associated significantly with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels following adjusting with age, gender and oral corticosteroids use of the patient. Type I cytokine (IFN-), IL-8, and IL-19 were associated with increased expression, while Type II cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) with lower expression of ACE2 in lung tissue (airway epithelium and/or lung biopsies) of moderate and severe asthmatic patients. Of note, IL-19 was associated with ACE2 expression while IL-17 was associated with TMPRSS2 expression in sputum of asthmatic subjects. In vitro treatment of bronchial fibroblasts with IL-17 and IL-19 cytokines confirmed the regulatory effect of these cytokines on SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors. Our results suggest that the type of inflammation may regulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the lung tissue of asthmatics and may hence affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Asthma Associated Cytokines Regulate the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 in the Lung Tissue of Asthmatic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physicians and scientists around the world are aggressively attempting to develop effective treatment strategies. The treatment goal is to reduce the fatality rate in 15% to 20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who develop severe inflammatory conditions that can lead to pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These conditions are major causes of death in these patients. Convalescent plasma (CP) collected from patients recovered from the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been considered as an effective treatment method for COVID-19. Moreover, low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia was historically used to treat pneumonia during the first half of the 20th century. The concept of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia was first introduced in March 2020. Later scientists from Canada, Spain, United States, Germany and France also confirmed the potential efficacy of LDRT for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The rationale behind introducing LDRT as an effective treatment method for pneumonia in COVID-19 patients is not only due to its anti-inflammatory effect, but also in optimization of the activity of the immune system. Moreover, LDRT, unlike other treatment methods such as antiviral drugs, does not have the key disadvantage of exerting a significant selective pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hence does not lead to evolution of the virus through mutations. Given these considerations, we believe that a hybrid treatment including both CP and LDRT can trigger synergistic responses that will help healthcare providers in mitigating today's COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Low Dose Radiation Therapy and Convalescent Plasma: How a Hybrid Method May Maximize Benefits for COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inappropriate use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to increase the burden of antimicrobial resistance.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. SETTINGS: Clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing students from nine Belgian nursing schools. METHODS: All students enrolled in nursing education are eligible to participate. The survey consists of five dimensions: demographics, risk perception, self-efficacy, support and communication, and resilience. RESULTS: The gaps that were identified by students focused on the need for more psychosocial support, establishing (regular) contact with their clinical placement supervisor, recognition of the difficult work situation, and the need for more space to unwind. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students expressed a strong need to be heard, prepared, and supported. Most students felt supported by their nursing schools. Because of COVID-19, the role of the preceptor became more important. However, due to several reasons, the perceptor did not always meet the student's expectations. Preparing students for specific competencies is needed. In spite of the efforts of nursing schools and clinical sites, students often got lost in the chaos of the pandemic. This resulted in practical worries, fewer learning opportunities, and even fundamental doubts about their choice to become a nurse. Finally, it crucial that nursing schools and clinical sites communicate about matters such as the responsibility for testing nursing students, the provisions of uniforms and personal protective equipment, and structurally sharing guidelines with students to provide safe patient care.","output":"Clinical placement experience of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydrophilic poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE) copolymers with 27 mol %, 32 mol % and 44 mol % ethylene were functionalized by melt radical graft copolymerization with 2,4-diamino-6-diallylamino-1,3,5-triazine (NDAM) using reactive extrusion.

Previously the functional role of this extra domain has been completely unknown, and it was believed that the coronavirus 3CL proteases share the same enzymatic mechanism with picornavirus 3C proteases, which contain the chymotrypsin fold but have no extra domain. To understand the functional role of the extra domain and to characterize the enzyme-substrate interactions by use of the dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy, we 1) dissected the full-length SARS 3CL protease into two distinct folds and subsequently investigated their structural and dimerization properties and 2) studied the structural and binding interactions of three substrate peptides with the entire enzyme and its two dissected folds. The results lead to several findings; 1) although two dissected parts folded into the native-like structures, the chymotrypsin fold only had weak activity as compared with the entire enzyme, and 2) although the chymotrypsin fold remained a monomer within a wide range of protein concentrations, the extra domain existed as a stable dimer even at a very low concentration. This observation strongly indicates that the extra domain contributes to the dimerization of the SARS 3CL protease, thus, switching the enzyme from the inactive form (monomer) to the active form (dimer). This discovery not only separates the coronavirus 3CL protease from the picornavirus 3C protease in terms of the enzymatic mechanism but also defines the dimerization interface on the extra helical domain as a new target for design of the specific protease inhibitors.

Participants' TS and NTS were evaluated by two blinded assessors using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) global rating scale and the HUman Factors in intraoperative Ophthalmic Emergencies Scoring System (HUFOES) respectively. Paired t-tests were used to establish the difference in mean HUFOES and OSATS scores between initial and repeat simulations; p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

PED causes lethal watery diarrhea in piglets, which has led to substantial economic losses in many countries and is a great threat to the global swine industry. Interferons (IFNs) are major cytokines involved in host innate immune defense, which induce the expression of a broad range of antiviral effectors that help host to control and antagonize viral infections. PEDV infection does not elicit a robust IFN response, and some of the mechanisms used by the virus to counteract the host innate immune response have been unraveled. PEDV evades the host innate immune response by two main strategies including: (1) encoding IFN antagonists to disrupt innate immune pathway, and (2) hiding its viral RNA to avoid the exposure of viral RNA to immune sensors. This review highlights the immune evasion mechanisms employed by PEDV, which provides insights for the better understanding of PEDV-host interactions and developing effective vaccines and antivirals against CoVs.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and the Host Innate Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Guttmacher-Lancet Commission report on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights called for the acceleration of progress to achieve SRHR that is essential for sustainable development.

Method: This study compared patients who admitted to the pediatric emergency and neonatal outpatient clinics with upper and lower respiratory tract infection symptoms and were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for community-acquired pneumonia during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season in pre-coronovirus disease (COVID) (October 2019 - March 2020) and post-COVID (October 2020 - March 2021) era. Results: A total of 869 patient records were screened. Of these, 70 patients (22%) in the pre-COVID era and 15 patients (6.8%) in the post-COVID era met the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. In the pre- and post-COVID era respectively, males accounted for 57.1% and 73.3% of patients (p>0.05), the mean gestational age at birth was 372 and 353 weeks (p<0.05), the mean birth weight was 3045601 and 2386840 g (p<0.05), the mean postnatal age at admission was 93 and 71 days (p>0.05), and the mean length of hospital stay was 93 and 71 days (p>0.05).

Ancestral Old-World monkeys and apes synthesizing -gal epitopes underwent complete extinction 20C30 million years ago, and their mutated progeny lacking -gal epitopes survived. Humans, apes, and Old-World monkeys which evolved from the surviving progeny lack -gal epitopes and produce the natural anti-Gal antibody which binds specifically to -gal epitopes. Because of this reciprocal distribution of the -gal epitope and anti-Gal in mammals, transplantation of organs from non-primate mammals (e.g., pig xenografts) into Old-World monkeys or humans results in hyperacute rejection following anti-Gal binding to -gal epitopes on xenograft cells. The in vivo immunocomplexing between anti-Gal and -gal epitopes on molecules, pathogens, cells, or nanoparticles may be harnessed for development of novel immunotherapies (referred to as -gal therapies) in various clinical settings because such immune complexes induce several beneficial immune processes. These immune processes include localized activation of the complement system which can destroy pathogens and generate chemotactic peptides that recruit antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells, targeting of antigens presenting -gal epitopes for extensive uptake by APCs, and activation of recruited macrophages into pro-reparative macrophages. Some of the suggested -gal therapies associated with these immune processes are as follows: 1. Increasing efficacy of enveloped-virus vaccines by synthesizing -gal epitopes on vaccinating inactivated viruses, thereby targeting them for extensive uptake by APCs. 2. Conversion of autologous tumors into antitumor vaccines by expression of -gal epitopes on tumor cell membranes. 3. Accelerating healing of external and internal injuries by -gal nanoparticles which decrease the healing time and diminish scar formation. 4. Increasing anti-GalCmediated protection against zoonotic viruses presenting -gal epitopes and against protozoa, such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, and Plasmodium, by vaccination for elevating production of the anti-Gal antibody. The efficacy and safety of these therapies were demonstrated in transgenic mice and pigs lacking -gal epitopes and producing anti-Gal, raising the possibility that these -gal therapies may be considered for further evaluation in clinical trials.","output":"Biosynthesis of -Gal Epitopes (Gal1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-R) and Their Unique Potential in Future -Gal Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adrenal hemorrhage (AH) is a rare condition.

Using these data we estimated real-world time-varying effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), and Ad26.COV2.S (J & J) COVID-19 vaccines to quantify the public health benefits of Puerto Rico's immunization campaign. Furthermore, we compared the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines before and after the dominance of the Delta variant. As of this writing, Puerto Rico had a higher vaccination rate and lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rate than all 50 States in the USA. Methods We used data obtained from the integration of the Puerto Rico Department of Health databases holding vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and COVID-19 hospitalizations, and deaths. We estimated time-varying vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections by fitting a statistical model that adjusts for time-varying incidence rates, age, gender, and day of the week. We also used this model to estimate the relative risk of hospitalization and deaths comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. Code and data are provided to reproduce the analysis here: https://github.com/rafalab/vax-eff-pr Results All vaccines were effective at reducing risks for all outcomes across all age groups. At the peak of their protection, mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S had an effectiveness of 87% (85% - 89%), 85% (82% - 87%), and 65% (58% - 70%), with Ad26.COV2.S reaching this peak 32 days after the being considered fully vaccinated. After four months, effectiveness waned to about 73%, 58%, and 32% for mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S, respectively. All vaccines had a lower effectiveness for those over 85 years, with the decrease in effectiveness particularly low for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. We found no clear evidence that effectiveness was different after the Delta variant became dominant. For those infected, the vaccines provided further protection against hospitalization and deaths across all age groups, although the protection was less for those above 85 years. Using the rates observed for the unvaccinated we would have observed 6,109 and 2,071 hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated population but we instead observed 728 and 164, respectively. Conclusions The mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines where highly effective across all age groups. They were still effective after four months although the protection did wain. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was effective but to a lesser degree, especially for the older age groups, and with the protection waning substantially sooner in comparison to the other two vaccines.","output":"Time-varying effectiveness of the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths: an analysis based on observational data from Puerto Rico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 crisis, with its associated school and daycare closures as well as social-distancing requirements, has the potential to magnify gender differences both in terms of childcare arrangements within the household and at work.

Behavioral Activation (BA) offers an intervention framework for an integrated treatment targeting both depression and critical health behaviors post-ACS. Behavioral Activation for Health and Depression (BA-HD) was developed and pilot tested in a multiphase iterative process. METHODS: First, an initial treatment manual was conceptualized based on the teams prior work, as well as the extant literature. Second, qualitative interviews were conducted with target patients and target providers on the proposed BA-HD treatment rationale, content, and structure. Framework matrix analyses were used to summarize and aggregate responses. Third, an expert panel was convened to elicit additional manual refinements. Finally, patients with post-ACS depression and health behavior non-adherence were recruited to complete an open pilot trial to evaluate acceptability (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ], exit interview) and treatment engagement (number of sessions attended; treatment completion was considered completion of 8 out of 10 possible sessions). RESULTS: The initial BA-HD treatment manual expanded an existing treatment manual for post-ACS BA-based mood management and smoking cessation to target four health behaviors relevant to post-ACS patients (e.g., smoking cessation, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet). After the initial conceptualization, ten post-ACS patients and eight cardiac rehabilitation professionals completed qualitative interviews. Patients endorsed bi-directional interactions between mood and health behaviors post-ACS. Both patients and providers expressed general support of the proposed treatment rationale and values-guided, collaborative goal-setting approach. Patients, providers, and experts provided feedback that shaped the iterative manual development. After the BA-HD manual was finalized, eight participants were enrolled in a single-arm pilot trial. The mean CSQ score was 30.57  2.23, indicating high satisfaction. Seven out of eight (88%) completed treatment. Pre- to post treatment improvements in depressed mood and health behaviors were promising. CONCLUSIONS: BA-HD treatment is an acceptable approach to target both mood and health behaviors in post-ACS patients with depression.

According to routine cystourethrographic findings obtained on the sixth or eighth postoperative day, which indicated leakage severity, patients were divided into three groups: no-leakage, grade 1 (linear shaped leakage, but not spreading), and grade 2 (spreading strip-shaped leakage). The preoperative factors and intraoperative factors were compared between no-leakage and leakage group (grade 1 and grade 2). Continence recovery was compared between the three groups.

Continence recovery rates for no-leakage, grade 1 leakage, and grade 2 leakage groups were 11%, 20%, and 25% after 1 month (P = 0.131); 25%, 25%, and 45.8% after 3 months (P = 0.474); 44.6%, 55%, and 60.8% after 6 months (P = 0.184); and 63.1%, 87.5%, and 78.2% after 12 months (P = 0.095), respectively. In conclusion, urinary leakage in urethrovesical anastomosis, even at its severity, had no negative effects on continence recovery after RALP.","output":"Impact of the severity of urethrovesical anastomotic leakage on urinary continence following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is combating an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 1-4 .

Nuoro province (Sardinia, Italy), characterized by a relatively isolated geographical location and a low population density, was severely hit and displayed a high incidence of infection. METHODS: Amplicon approach Next Generation Sequencing and subsequent variant calling in 92 respiratory samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients involved in infection clusters from March 2020 to May 2021. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis displayed a coherent distribution of sequences in terms of lineage and temporal evolution of pandemic. Circulating lineage/clade characterization highlighted a growing diversity over time, with an increasingly growing number of mutations and variability of spike and nucleocapsid proteins, while viral RdRp appeared to be more conserved. A total of 384 different mutations were detected, of which 196 were missense and 147 synonymous ones. Mapping mutations along the viral genome showed an irregular distribution in key genes. S gene was the most mutated gene with missense and synonymous variants frequencies of 58.8 and 23.5%, respectively. Mutation rates were similar for the S and N genes with one mutation every 788 nucleotides and every 712 nucleotides, respectively. Nsp12 gene appeared to be more conserved, with one mutation every 1,270 nucleotides. The frequency of variant Y144F in the spike protein deviated from global values with higher prevalence of this mutation in the island. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the 92 viral genome highlighted evolution over time and identified which mutations are more widespread than others. The high number of sequences also permits the identification of subclusters that are characterized by subtle differences, not only in terms of lineage, which may be used to reconstruct transmission clusters.

In many cases, such as the recent mucormycosis spread in the COVID-19 pandemic, an initial treatment can be safely suggested to the patient during the earliest stage of the mycological diagnostic process by performing a direct examination of biopsies or samples through a microscope. Computer-aided diagnosis systems using deep learning models have been trained and used for the late mycological diagnostic stages. However, there are no reference literature works made for the early stages. A mycological laboratory in Colombia donated the images used for the development of this research work. They were manually labelled into five classes and curated with a subject matter expert assistance. The images were later cropped and patched with automated code routines to produce the final dataset. This paper presents experimental results classifying five fungi types using two different deep learning approaches and three different convolutional neural network models, VGG16, Inception V3, and ResNet50. The first approach benchmarks the classification performance for the models trained from scratch, while the second approach benchmarks the classification performance using pre-trained models based on the ImageNet dataset. Using k-fold cross-validation testing on the 5-class dataset, the best performing model trained from scratch was Inception V3, reporting 73.2% accuracy. Also, the best performing model using transfer learning was VGG16 reporting 85.04%.

Our understanding of clinical characteristics of liver damage and the relationship with disease severity in COVID-19 is still limited. AIM To investigate the serum hepatic enzyme activities in different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients, evaluate their relationship with the illness severity, and analyze correlation of glycyrrhizin treatment and abnormal liver enzyme activities. METHODS 147 patients with COVID-19 were employed in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were analyzed in these patients. Patients with diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) treatment were further investigated. RESULTS Of the 147 patients, 56 (38.1%) had abnormal ALT activity and 80 (54.4%) had abnormal AST activity. The peak of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities occurred at 3 to 6 days after on admission. Serum AST and LDH levels were elevated, while the SOD level was decreased in severe and critical patients, compared with mild cases. DG treatment may alleviate the abnormal liver enzyme activities in non-critical COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal liver functions may be observed in patients with COVID-19, which were associated with SARS-CoV-2 induced acute liver damage. Glycyrrhizin treatment may be an effective therapeutic approach for the outcome of abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in severe COVID-19 cases.

Finding and isolating these silent carriers is a crucial step in confining the spread of the disease. A sudden loss of the sense of smell has been self-reported by COVID-19 patients across different countries, consistent with expression of the molecular factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake into human olfactory epithelial supporting cells. However, precise quantification of olfactory loss in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers is missing to date. Methods: To quantify olfactory functions in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, we designed an olfactory-action meter that determines detectability indices at different odor concentrations and an olfactory matching accuracy score using monomolecular odors. The optimization of test parameters allowed us to reliably and accurately assess olfactory deficits in a patient within 20 minutes. Findings: Measurement of detection indices at low concentrations revealed a 50% reduction in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Further, patients with better detection scores showed significantly reduced olfactory matching accuracies compared to normal healthy subjects. Our quantification of olfactory loss, considering all parameters, identified 82% of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers with olfactory deficits. However, on subjective evaluation, only 15% of the patients noticed a compromised ability to smell. Interpretation: Compromised olfactory fitness can serve as a strong basis for identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Detailed design specifications and protocols provided here should enable the development of a sensitive, fast, and economical screening strategy that can be administered to large populations to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth. These obligate parasites infect every form of life, from archaea and eubacteria to fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses play key roles in global ecologythey form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity, influence the composition and evolution of host populations, and affect the cycling of chemical compounds through the environment. Research has focused on the tiny fraction that causes disease in humans, domestic animals, and crops; sequencing surveys have suggested that the majority of viruses are completely unknown. The ability of viruses to jump species barriers, move between habitats, and circle the globe rapidly underscores the importance of continued vigilance for naturally emerging or deliberately engineered outbreaks. Viruses are extremely simple life forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential. Virus particles constitute a minimal set of components, primarily those required to deliver the genome to the target cell and initiate replication. Consequently, virus particles (or virions) are extremely small, most in the range of 20 to 200 nm in diameter. Virions are diverse not only in size but also in composition, morphology, and genome characteristics. Virus particles may be irregular in shape or possess a distinct symmetry, such as helical or icosahedral. Particles may be surrounded by a host-derived membrane, termed enveloped, or a tight protein shell, termed nonenveloped.","output":"Keeping Track of Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandmie lie au COVID-19 a conduit la France  imposer un confinement strict, affectant les habitudes des familles dans de nombreux domaines Cette tude visait  valuer les changements possibles dans les comportements alimentaires des enfants, les pratiques ducatives parentales en matire d'alimentation et les motivations d'achat des aliments, pendant le confinement par rapport  la priode avant confinement Pendant le confinement, les parents de 498 enfants ags de 3  12 ans (238 gar?ons ;M = 7,32 ;ET = 2,27) ont rpondu  une enqute nationale en ligne comprenant les items issus de questionnaires valids (ex CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD) Ils ont dcrit leur situation et celle de l'enfant pendant le confinement, et rtrospectivement sur la priode le prcdant (volet quantitatif) L'enqute comprenait aussi trois questions ouvertes (volet qualitatif) pour lesquelles les parents pouvaient partager leurs expriences positives et ngatives concernant l'alimentation familiale durant cette priode, et ce qu'ils aimeraient maintenir au-del Dans le volet quantitatif de l'tude, de nombreux parents ont signal des changements dans les comportements alimentaires des enfants (60 %), dans les pratiques ducatives (65 %) et dans les motivations d'achat des aliments (85 %) Lorsque des changements taient dcrits, l'apptit de l'enfant, le plaisir  manger, la ? ractivit aux aliments ?, le ? manger motionnel ? et la frquence des collations augmentaient Aussi, 53 % des parents rapportaient une augmentation du niveau d'ennui de leur enfant L'ennui accru des enfants prdisait de manire significative une augmentation de la ? ractivit aux aliments ? et de la frquence des collations entre les repas Lorsque les parents ont chang leurs pratiques, ils sont devenus plus permissifs : moins de rgles, plus d'apaisement avec la nourriture (? soothing with food ?), plus d'autonomie de l'enfant dans le choix des aliments  consommer, dans les quantits consommes, et du lieu de consommation Les parents achetaient plus frquemment des aliments ? plaisir ? et durables, prparaient plus de repas ? faits maison ? et cuisinaient davantage avec l'enfant Ces changements des pratiques et motivations des parents taient expliqus par le niveau d'tude, la situation professionnelle et financire et l'augmentation du niveau de stress Les analyses du volet qualitatif rvlent, sur le versant vcu positivement, une rappropriation de l'alimentation tant sur la qualit des aliments choisis (locaux, frais ) que sur les pratiques (importance du ? fait-maison ?, de la transmission ), et un plaisir affirm de cuisiner ensemble et de partager les repas Sur le versant ngatif, les parents soulignent la surcharge impose par la frquence des repas  prparer, le stress et la surconsommation Le confinement a entra?n des changements notables dans les habitudes alimentaires des familles : les comportements et pratiques sont devenus plus centrs sur l'enfant, et plus axs sur les valeurs de plaisir, de commensalit et de durabilit [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Nutrition Clinique et Metabolisme is the property of Elsevier B V and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Les habitudes alimentaires des familles fran?aises pendant le confinement li au COVID-19 : (comment) ont-elles chang ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If Sustainable Developmental Goal 3 and Universal Health Coverage are to be achieved, functioning is a third health indicator which must be assessed and integrated into global health population-based metrics alongside mortality and morbidity.

Consequently, early detection and analysis of the infection patterns are crucial for controlling infection spread as well as devising a treatment plan. This work proposes a two-stage deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of COVID-19 infected regions in Lung CT images. In the first stage, initially, COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the existing deep CNN models. The performance of the proposed CoV-CTNet is evaluated using Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure (0.98) and that of proposed CoV-RASeg using Dice Similarity (DS) score (0.95).

In order to further investigate their interplay, we defined the kinetic parameters of CK1 towards its substrates: ATP, casein, Dvl2 and DDX3X. CK1 affinity for ATP depends on the nature of the substrate: increasing of casein concentrations led to an increase of KmATP, while increasing DDX3X reduced it. In literature, DDX3X is described to act as an allosteric activator of CK1.

Conclusions Psychosocial health in people with diabetes improved following reopening of society. However, increases in loneliness and decreases in quality of life during lockdown indicates a potential need to mitigate the acute effects of such policies.","output":"Psychosocial health in people with diabetes during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the health care system in unprecedented ways.

METHODS A prospective longitudinal multicenter study was conducted in 14 hospitals in Sweden. Two-hundred-and-thirty-five women with EC were included; 116 underwent surgery that included lymphadenectomy (+LA) and 119 were without lymphadenectomy (-LA). Lymphedema was assessed objectively on four occasions; preoperatively, at 4-6 weeks, six months and one year postoperatively using systematic measurement of leg circumferences, enabling calculation of leg volumes, and a clinical grading of LLL, and subjectively by the patient's perception of lymphedema measured by a lymphedema-specific quality-of-life instrument. Lymphocyst was evaluated by vaginal ultrasonography. RESULTS After one year the incidence of LLL after increase in leg volume adjusted for body mass index was 15.8% in +LA women and 3.4% in -LA women. The corresponding figures for clinical grading were 24.1% and 11.8%, and for patient-reported perceived LLL 10.7% and 5.1%. The agreement between the modalities revealed fair to moderate correlation between patient-reported LLL and clinical grading, but poor agreement between volume increase and patient-reported LLL or clinical grading. Lymphocysts were found in 4.3% after one year. CONCLUSIONS Although the incidence of LLL and lymphocysts after surgery for EC including LA seemed to be relatively high the study demonstrated significant variations in incidence depending on the measurement modality. This emphasizes the need for a 'gold standard' of measurement of LLL in clinical practice and research.","output":"Incidence of lymphedema in the lower limbs and lymphocyst formation within one year of surgery for endometrial cancer: A prospective longitudinal multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The medium-term and long-term impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer is not yet known. In this study, we aimed to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and their impact on the survival of patients with cancer. We also aimed to describe patterns of resumption and modifications of systemic anti-cancer therapy following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: OnCovid is an active European registry study enrolling consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with a history of solid or haematological malignancy and who had a diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this retrospective study, patients were enrolled from 35 institutions across Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, and entered into the registry at the point of data lock (March 1, 2021), were eligible for analysis. The present analysis was focused on COVID-19 survivors who underwent clinical reassessment at each participating institution. We documented prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and described factors associated with their development and their association with post-COVID-19 survival, which was defined as the interval from post-COVID-19 reassessment to the patients death or last follow-up. We also evaluated resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients treated within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. The OnCovid study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974. FINDINGS: 2795 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, were entered into the study by the time of the data lock on March 1, 2021. After the exclusion of ineligible patients, the final study population consisted of 2634 patients. 1557 COVID-19 survivors underwent a formal clinical reassessment after a median of 221 months (IQR 84C578) from cancer diagnosis and 44 days (28C329) from COVID-19 diagnosis. 234 (150%) patients reported COVID-19 sequelae, including respiratory symptoms (116 [496%]) and residual fatigue (96 [410%]). Sequelae were more common in men (vs women; p=0041), patients aged 65 years or older (vs other age groups; p=0048), patients with two or more comorbidities (vs one or none; p=00006), and patients with a history of smoking (vs no smoking history; p=00004). Sequelae were associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 (p<00001), complicated COVID-19 (p<00001), and COVID-19 therapy (p=00002). With a median post-COVID-19 follow-up of 128 days (95% CI 113C148), COVID-19 sequelae were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 180 [95% CI 118C275]) after adjusting for time to post-COVID-19 reassessment, sex, age, comorbidity burden, tumour characteristics, anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 severity. Among 466 patients on systemic anti-cancer therapy, 70 (150%) permanently discontinued therapy, and 178 (382%) resumed treatment with a dose or regimen adjustment. Permanent treatment discontinuations were independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 353 [95% CI 145C859]), but dose or regimen adjustments were not (084 [035C202]). INTERPRETATION: Sequelae post-COVID-19 affect up to 15% of patients with cancer and adversely affect survival and oncological outcomes after recovery. Adjustments to systemic anti-cancer therapy can be safely pursued in treatment-eligible patients.

Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (>10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score?; At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not?; and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?","output":"Would You Recommend Aspirin to This Patient for Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease? : Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization has issued international instructions for certification and classification (coding) of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as cause of death.

Many times networks over which contagions spread are unobserved, and such networks are often dynamic and change over time. In this paper, we investigate the problem of inferring dynamic networks based on information diffusion data. We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network that changes over time, while we observe the results of a dynamic process spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network. We develop an on-line algorithm that relies on stochastic convex optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic network inference problem. We apply our algorithm to information diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment with more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading over the network in a one year period. We study the evolution of information pathways in the online media space and find interesting insights. Information pathways for general recurrent topics are more stable across time than for on-going news events. Clusters of news media sites and blogs often emerge and vanish in matter of days for on-going news events.

Patients with active Cushings syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing. Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. When extensive differential diagnostic testing and/or surgery is not feasible, it should be deferred and medical treatment should be initiated. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery should be delayed during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence.

PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the clinical case of a patient affected by idiopathic myelofibrosis (MF) and splenomegaly who was admitted to our Department to perform a splenectomy for a suspected 5-cm splenic lesion. DISCUSSION The splenic longitudinal diameter measured 26 cm. The patient underwent splenectomy by laparoscopy, combining a single-port access and a gel-port device. The operation was completed laparoscopically. The operating time was 220 min and the estimate blood loss was 100 ml. The patient was discharged at 11 post-operative day in overall good conditions. Upon pathological analysis the splenic lesion was a localization of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma in the context of MF.

The analysis included patients with illness onset from March 2020 to January 2021 and met MIS-C case definition. Main Outcomes and Measures: Geographic and temporal distribution of MIS-C was compared with that of COVID-19 nationally, by region, and level of urbanicity by county. Clinical and laboratory findings and changes over time were described by age group and by presence or absence of preceding COVID-19. Results: A total of 1733 patients with MIS-C were identified; 994 (57.6%) were male and 1117 (71.3%) were Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black. Gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, and conjunctival hyperemia were reported by 53% (n = 931) to 67% (n = 1153) of patients. A total of 937 patients (54%) had hypotension or shock, and 1009 (58.2%) were admitted for intensive care. Cardiac dysfunction was reported in 484 patients (31.0%), pericardial effusion in 365 (23.4%), myocarditis in 300 (17.3%), and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysms in 258 (16.5%). Patients aged 0 to 4 years had the lowest proportion of severe manifestations, although 171 patients (38.4%) had hypotension or shock and 197 (44.3%) were admitted for intensive care. Patients aged 18 to 20 years had the highest proportions with myocarditis (17 [30.9%]), pneumonia (20 [36.4%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (10 [18.2%]), and polymerase chain reaction positivity (39 [70.9%]). These older adolescents also had the highest proportion reporting preceding COVID-19-like illness (63%). Nationally, the first 2 MIS-C peaks followed the COVID-19 peaks by 2 to 5 weeks. The cumulative MIS-C incidence per 100a?000 persons younger than 21 years was 2.1 and varied from 0.2 to 6.3 by state. Twenty-four patients (1.4%) died. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of a large cohort of patients with MIS-C, 2 peaks that followed COVID-19 peaks by 2 to 5 weeks were identified. The geographic and temporal association of MIS-C with the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that MIS-C resulted from delayed immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Access to NCD medicines was affected at three levels, service delivery, health facility information systems and the medicines supply chain to health facilities. In response to these gaps, the Ministry of Health released clear directives and interim guidelines for continuity of NCD service delivery. However, implementation of guidelines was not apparent from conversations with county officials or from assessment of county services by the Ministry. Rather, heterogeneity was observed in counties' responsiveness to patient needs, where 5 out of 13 counties used mHealth technologies, while 5 had no established system to reach patients.

The most general concept to begin with is the most importantthe microbiological purity of the starting viral culture. For every virus antigen, there should be a parallel normal antigen to serve as the negative control in the test. Normal antigens are prepared by shaminoculating cell cultures with negative culture material and following these cultures through the entire virus culture and antigen preparation steps in exact parallel fashion. Depending on the test and the day-to-day usage, many antigens are preserved by adding thimerosal to the final product to a final concentration of 1:10,000, or sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.1%. Special preparation of antigens is required for many diagnostic tests, monoclonal or polyclonal antibody production, and many enzyme immunoassays tests. Many viruses and antigens have their own peculiarities based on the specific properties of each virus group. Chromatography is considered to be the most effective means of producing purified preparations of virus proteins, this being achieved by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.","output":"3 Preparation of antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a state estimation-based robust optimal control strategy for influenza epidemics in an interactive human society in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Interactive society is influenced by the random entrance of individuals from other human societies whose effects can be modeled as a non-Gaussian noise. Since only the number of exposed and infected humans can be measured, states of the influenza epidemics are first estimated by an extended maximum correntropy Kalman filter (EMCKF) to provide a robust state estimation in the presence of the non-Gaussian noise. An online quadratic program (QP) optimization is then synthesized subject to a robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF) to minimize susceptible and infected humans, while minimizing and bounding the rates of vaccination and antiviral treatment. The joint QP-RCLF-EMCKF meets multiple design specifications such as state estimation, tracking, pointwise control optimality, and robustness to parameter uncertainty and state estimation errors that have not been achieved simultaneously in previous studies. The uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB)/convergence of error trajectories is guaranteed using a Lyapunov stability argument. The soundness of the proposed approach is validated on the influenza epidemics of an interactive human society with a population of 16000. Simulation results show that the QP-RCLF-EMCKF achieves appropriate tracking and state estimation performance. The robustness of the proposed controller is finally illustrated in the presence of modeling error and non-Gaussian noise.","output":"State Estimation-Based Robust Optimal Control of Influenza Epidemics in an Interactive Human Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background At the end of 2019, a novel pneumonia-causing Coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency In February 2020, WHO designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for Coronavirus disease 2019 The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the perception of young Italians and to assess their knowledge and attitudes about the disease Methods An online survey was conducted on 3rd-4th-5th February 2020 with the collaboration of Skuola net, an important Italian Website for students Young people had the opportunity to participate in the survey by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new Coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage Results 5234 responses were received of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males, aged from 11 to 30 82,4% were students (50,4% high school students) while 17,6% did not attend school or university Regarding knowledge, 80% of the participants knew that the infection occurs through droplets from infected people;63% knew that symptoms can appear up to 14 days after exposure;80% knew that a vaccine has not yet been discovered Regarding attitudes, 36% admitted that their attitude towards Chinese tourists has significantly worsened;26% did not buy from Chinese run stores and 24% avoided Chinese restaurants Conclusions Although most of the participants seem correctly informed about COVID-19, young Italians are at risk of assuming irrational behavior due to psychosis Key messages The global emergency of COVID-19 needs adequate information to avoid the spread of dangerous psychoses Young people, usual users of social networks as a means of information, are more at risk of being influenced by fake news and adopting wrong behaviors","output":"COVID-19 and young Italians: results of a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates oil price risk exposure of financial and non-financial industries around the world during the COVIDC19 pandemic.

Since the mouse and human immune systems are quite different, gaining insight into the activity of CHOS on human cell lines, using well-characterized CHOS mixtures, is of considerable interest. Bacillus subtilis chitosanase (BsCsn46A) can efficiently convert chitosan to mixtures of water soluble low molecular weight CHOS. Here, the anti-inflammatory activity of a properly characterized CHOS mixture was studied, using human THP-1 cells that were differentiated to mature monocytes using vitamin D3. Addition of CHOS reduced the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with bacterial lipopolyssacharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner and without affecting cell viability. Interestingly, only minimal effects of CHOS were observed in similar experiments with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) differentiated, macrophage-like, THP-1 cells. Altogether, in addition to showing promising biological effects of well-characterized low molecular weight soluble CHOS in a human system, the present study also points at Vitamin D3-stimulated THP-1 cells as a favorable system for assessing the anti-inflammatory activity of bioactive compounds.","output":"Anti-inflammatory activity of soluble chito-oligosaccharides (CHOS) on VitD3-induced human THP-1 monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We performed this case-control observational study to evaluate the comparison of the length of duration of SARS COV-2 infection and the cycle threshold (Ct) value of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharynx swab between the probiotics intake (case) group and the non-probiotics intake (control) group.

Recent evidence from human lesion and neuroimaging studies implicated anterior hippocampus (aHC) and amygdala in approach/avoidance decisions under threat, and linked their integrity to cautious behavior. Here we sought to elucidate how threat dimensions and behavior are represented in these structures.Twenty human participants (11 female) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task during high-resolution functional MRI. Participants could gather tokens under threat of capture by a virtual predator, which would lead to token loss. Threat probability (predator wake-up rate) and magnitude (amount of token loss) varied on each trial. To disentangle effects of threat features, and ensuing behavior, we performed a multifold parametric analysis.We found that high threat probability and magnitude related to BOLD signal in left anterior hippocampus/entorhinal cortex. However BOLD signal in this region was better explained by avoidance behavior than by these threat features. A priori region-of-interest analysis confirmed the relation of anterior hippocampus BOLD response with avoidance. Exploratory subfield analysis revealed that this relation was specific to anterior CA2/3 but not CA1. Left lateral amygdala responded to low and high, but not intermediate threat probability.Our results suggest that anterior hippocampus BOLD signal is better explained by avoidance behavior than by threat features in approach-avoidance conflict. Rather than representing threat features in a monotonic manner, it appears that anterior hippocampus may compute approach/avoidance decisions based on integration of situational threat features represented in other neural structures.Significance statementAn effective threat anticipation system is crucial to survival across species. Natural threats, however, are diverse and have distinct features. To be able to adapt to different modes of danger, the brain needs to recognize these features, integrate them and use them to modify behavior. Our results disclose the human anterior hippocampus as a likely arbiter of approach/avoidance decisions harnessing compound environmental information while partially replicating previous findings and blending into recent efforts to illuminate the neural basis of approach-avoidance conflict in humans.","output":"Hippocampal representation of threat features and behavior in a human approach-avoidance conflict anxiety task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral respiratory illness. This illness is spurred on by a coronavirus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first detected in Asia in late February 2003. The genome of this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the study of SARS-CoV disease and the identification of effective drugs to treat this disease can be new clues for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. This study aimed to discover novel potential drugs for SARS-CoV disease in order to treating SARS-Cov-2 disease based on a novel systems biology approach. To this end, gene co-expression network analysis was applied. First, the gene co-expression network was reconstructed for 1441 genes, and then two gene modules were discovered as significant modules. Next, a list of miRNAs and transcription factors that target gene co-expression modules' genes were gathered from the valid databases, and two sub-networks formed of transcription factors and miRNAs were established. Afterward, the list of the drugs targeting obtained sub-networks' genes was retrieved from the DGIDb database, and two drug-gene and drug-TF interaction networks were reconstructed. Finally, after conducting different network analyses, we proposed five drugs, including FLUOROURACIL, CISPLATIN, SIROLIMUS, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, and METHYLDOPA, as candidate drugs for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus treatment. Moreover, ten miRNAs including miR-193b, miR-192, miR-215, miR-34a, miR-16, miR-16, miR-92a, miR-30a, miR-7, and miR-26b were found to be significant miRNAs in treating SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","output":"Drug repurposing for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on gene co-expression network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019. Since then, it has been transmitted rapidly in China and the rest of the world. While Covid-19 transmission rate has been declining in China, it is increasing exponentially in Europe and America. Although there are numerous studies examining Covid-19 infection, including an archived paper looking into the meteorological effect, the role of outdoor air pollution has yet to be explored rigorously. It has been shown that air pollution will weaken the immune system, and increase the rate of respiratory virus infection. We postulate that outdoor air pollution concentrations will have a negative effect on Covid-19 infections in China, whilst lockdowns, characterized by strong social distancing and home isolation measures, will help to moderate such negative effect. Methods: We will collect the number of daily confirmed Covid-19 cases in 31 provincial capital cities in China during the period of 1 Dec 2019 to 20 Mar 2020 (from a popular Chinese online platform which aggregates all cases reported by the Chinese national/provincial health authorities). We will also collect daily air pollution and meteorology data at the city-level (from the Chinese National Environmental Monitoring Center and the US National Climatic Data Center), daily inter-city migration flows and intra-city movements (from Baidu). City-level demographics including age distribution and gender, education, and median household income can be obtained from the statistical yearbooks. City-level co-morbidity indicators including rates of chronic disease and co-infection can be obtained from related research articles. A regression model is developed to model the relationship between the infection rate of Covid-19 (number of confirmed cases/population at the city level) and outdoor air pollution at the city level, after taking into account confounding factors such as meteorology, inter- and intra-city movements, demographics, and co-morbidity and co-infection rates. In particular, we shall study how air pollution affects infection rates across different cities, including Wuhan. Our model will also study air pollution would affect infection rates in Wuhan before and after the lockdown. Expected findings: We expect there be a correlation between Covid-19 infection rate and outdoor air pollution. We also expect that reduced intra-city movement after the lockdowns in Wuhan and the rest of China will play an important role in reducing the infection rate. Interpretation: Infection rate is growing exponentially in major cities worldwide. We expect Covid-19 infection rate is related to the air pollution concentration, and is strongly dependent on inter- and intra-city movements. To reduce the infection rate, the international community may deploy effective air pollution reduction plans and social distancing policies.","output":"The Effects of Outdoor Air Pollution Concentrations and Lockdowns on Covid-19 Infections in Wuhan and Other Provincial Capitals in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palabras clave: administrador de la educacin, colaboracin, docentes, escuelas, pandemia This study examines and compares educational collaboration in various Chilean schools previous and during the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify the influence of three dimensions: formal roles, gender, and years of experience of 354 educative actors.

Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand approved the study. Data included total live births, maternal mortality ratio (MMR), age, ethnicity, place of admission, parity, pregnancy status, antenatal complications, gestational age (GA) at delivery, GA at COVID 19 diagnosis, GA at death, symptoms, comorbidity, investigations (HIV, platelets, lymphocytes and LDH), and fetal outcome. Descriptive statistics (mean  standard deviation, number and percentages) were calculated. RESULTS Six women died from COVID. All were African. Mean age was 33.5 (SD  4.3) years majority (83%) were multiparous. The mean GA at the time of diagnosis was 35 ( 5.8) weeks. All had dyspnea at presentation. All had hypertension. HIV rate (50%) was higher than the national rate. High lactic dehydrogenase was the commonest laboratory abnormality. Rate of macerated stillborn (66%) was very high. CONCLUSION To date, there are no African studies reporting on maternal mortality from COVID 19. This study provided valuable insight into maternal deaths due to COVID among South African women. COVID 19 is a novel cause of maternal death that has increased the death rate among South African pregnant women. Hypertensive women are at increased risk of death. They should be routinely tested for COVID. Women are at risk of death during the third trimester of pregnancy. High rate of stillborn is a concern. Decision to deliver earlier should be an option.

Autoimmune neutropenia is a relatively uncommon hematological disorder characterized by the autoantibody-induced destruction of neutrophils. It is usually triggered by viral infections with very few documented cases after influenza virus. CASE PRESENTATION: An 8-month-old male infant presented at the emergency room with a 5-days history of fever up to 39.7 C, cough and runny nose. In the blood test performed, severe neutropenia was diagnosed (neutrophils 109/L). A nasopharyngeal aspirate revealed a positive rapid test for Influenza A. Serum antineutrophil antibodies were determined with positive results. Neutropenia targeted panel showed no mutations. Despite maintenance of severe neutropenia for 9 months the course was uneventful without treatment. CONCLUSIONS: When severe neutropenia is diagnosed and confirmed, it is essential to rule out some potential etiologies and underlying conditions, since the appropriate subsequent management will depend on it. Although autoimmune neutropenia triggered by viral infections has been widely reported, it has seldom been reported after influenza infection. The benign course of the disease allows a conservative management in most cases.","output":"Autoimmune neutropenia associated with influenza virus infection in childhood: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To draw real-world evidence about the comparative effectiveness of complex time-varying treatment regimens on patient survival, we develop a joint marginal structural proportional hazards model and novel weighting schemes in continuous time to account for time-varying confounding and censoring.

Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage probability when analyzing observational longitudinal survival data with irregularly spaced time intervals, compared to conventional methods that require aligned measurement time points.

The majority of studies carried out in SARS-CoV-infected humans and animals attribute a dysregulated/exuberant innate response as a leading contributor to SARS-CoV-mediated pathology. A decade after the 2002C2003 SARS epidemic, we do not have any approved preventive or therapeutic agents available in case of re-emergence of SARS-CoV or other related viruses. A strong neutralizing antibody response generated against the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is completely protective in the susceptible host. However, neutralizing antibody titers and the memory B cell response are short-lived in SARS-recovered patients and the antibody will target primary homologous strain. Interestingly, the acute phase of SARS in humans is associated with a severe reduction in the number of T cells in the blood.

We propose a system called Deep Spatio-Temporal Predictor (DST-Predict), that can predict the future visit frequency of an individual based on one's past mobility behaviour patterns using GPS trace data collected from mobile phones. Predicting such spatial behavior is challenging, primarily because individuals' patterns of location visits for each individual consists of both systematic and random components, which vary across the spatial and temporal scales of analysis. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-view sequence-to-sequence model that uses Convolutional Long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) where the past history of frequent visit patterns features is used to predict individuals' future visit patterns in a multi-step manner. Using the GPS survey data obtained from 1,464 participants in western New York, US, we demonstrated that the proposed system is capable of predicting individuals' frequency of visits to common places in an urban setting, with high accuracy.","output":"DST-Predict: Predicting Individual Mobility Patterns From Mobile Phone GPS Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high prevalence of Covid-19 can have quite serious physical and psychological impacts.

Pressing relevance stems from the need to restart the economy dramatically affected by the lockdown. We employ a spatially explicit, data-intensive model of the patterns of disease spread in Italy, with the goal of providing tools to: estimate the baseline trajectory, i.e. the expected unfolding of the outbreak if the current containment measures were kept in place indefinitely; assess possible deviations from the baseline, should relaxations of the current lockdown result in increased disease transmission; and estimate the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. For instance, a 50% increase in effective transmission as a result of the loosening of confinement measures, to be instated on May 4, yields an epidemic curve that shows a major rebound larger than the previous peaks in most regions. A control effort, capable of isolating a daily percentage of approximately 7% of the individuals in the exposed and pre-symptomatic stages, proves necessary to counterbalance such an increase, and maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We explore several scenarios, provide the basic data to design the related control strategies and discuss their feasibility. Should suitable control via tracing and testing prove unfeasible, stop-and-go enforcement or delay of the lockdown relaxations would be necessary to reduce the isolation effort required to maintain the epidemic trajectory under control.","output":"The geography of COVID-19 spread in Italy and implications for the relaxation of confinement measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic aggregates composed of ribonucleoproteins that are induced during cellular stress when protein synthesis is inhibited. The function of SGs is poorly understood, but they are thought to be sites for reorganizing mRNA and protein. Several viruses can modulate SG formation, suggesting that SGs have an impact on virus infection. In this study, we have investigated the relationship of SG formation in Drosophila S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a member of the Dicistroviridae family. Despite a rapid shutoff of host translation during CrPV infection, several hallmark SG markers such as the Drosophila TIA-1 and G3BP (RasGAP-SH3-binding protein) homologs, Rox8 and Rin, respectively, do not aggregate in CrPV-infected cells, even when challenged with potent SG inducers such as heat shock, oxidative stress, and pateamine A treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a subset of P body markers become moderately dispersed at late times of infection. In contrast, as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization, poly(A)(+) RNA granules still form at late times of infection. These poly(A)(+) RNA granules do not contain viral RNA nor do they colocalize with P body markers. Finally, our results demonstrate that the CrPV viral 3C protease is sequestered to SGs under cellular stress but not during virus infection.

The various forms of interventions and measures adopted to control the disease affected people's social and behavioural practices. Aim This study aims to investigate COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) as well as misconceptions in Katsina state, one of the largest epicentres of the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. Methods The study is cross-sectional survey of 722 respondents using electronic questionnaire through the WhatsApp media platform. Results One thousand five hundred (1500) questionnaires were sent to the general public with a response rate of 48% (i.e. 722 questionnaires completed and returned). Among the respondents, 60% were men, 45% were 25-39 years of age, 56% held bachelor's degree/equivalent and above and 54% were employed. The study participants correct rate in the knowledge questionnaire was 80% suggesting high knowledge on the disease. A significant correlation (P < 0.05) exists between the average knowledge score of the participants and their level of education (Kendall's tau = 0.16). Overall, most of the participants agreed that the COVID-19 will be successfully controlled (84%) and the Nigerian government will win the fight against the pandemic (71%). Men were more likely than female (P < 0.05) to have recently attended a crowded place. Being more educated (bachelor's degree or equivalent and above vs diploma or equivalent and below) is associated with good COVID-19 related practices. Among the participants, 83% held at least one COVID-19 related misconception with the most frequent being that the virus was created in a laboratory (36%). Participants with lower level of education received and trust COVID-19 related information from local radio and television stations and participants at all levels of education selected that they would trust health unit and health care workers for COVID-19 related information. Conclusion Although there is high COVID-19 related knowledge among the sample, misconceptions are widespread among the participants. These misconceptions have consequences on the short- and long-term control efforts against the disease and hence should be incorporated in targeted campaigns. Health care related personnel should be in the fore front of the campaign.","output":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Knowledge, attitudes, practices (KAP) and misconceptions in the general population of Katsina State, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractPrevious research has explored the demands of amateur boxing-specific activity; however, no holistic review of the acute responses to such activity currently exists.

Psychosocial stress can trigger MC hyperactivation and increases pro-inflammatory cytokines in target tissues such as the skin. If the cholinergic system (CS) and Chrna7 ligands play a role in these cascades is largely unknown. Objective: To elucidate the role of the CS in the response to psychosocial stress using a mouse-model for stress-triggered cutaneous inflammatory circuits. Methods: Key CS markers (ACh, Ch, SLURP-1, SLURP-2, Lynx1, Chrm3, Chrna7, Chrna9, ChAT, VAChT, Oct3, AChE, and BChE) in skin and its MC (sMC), MC activation, immune parameters (TNF, IL1, IL10, TGF, HIF1, and STAT3) and oxidative stress were analyzed in skin from 24 h noise-stressed mice and in cultured MC (cMC) from C57BL/6 or Chrna7-Knockout mice. Results: First, Chrna7 and SLURP-1 mRNA were exclusively upregulated in stressed skin. Second, histomorphometry located Chrna7 and SLURP-1 in nerves and sMC and demonstrated upregulated contacts and increased Chrna7+ sMC in stressed skin, while 5 ng/mL SLURP-1 degranulated cMC. Third, IL1+ sMC were high in stressed skin, and while SLURP-1 alone had no significant effect on cMC cytokines, it upregulated IL1 in cMC from Chrna7-KO and in IL1-treated wildtype cMC. In addition, HIF1+ sMC were high in stressed skin and Chrna7-agonist AR-R 17779 induced ROS in cMC while SLURP-1 upregulated TNF and IL1 in cMC when HIF1 was blocked. Conclusions: These data infer that the CS plays a role in the regulation of stress-sensitive inflammatory responses but may have a surprising pro-inflammatory effect in healthy skin, driving IL1 expression if SLURP-1 is involved.","output":"New Pathways for the Skin's Stress Response: The Cholinergic Neuropeptide SLURP-1 Can Activate Mast Cells and Alter Cytokine Production in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our knowledge regarding the contribution of the innate immune system in recognizing and subsequently initiating a host response to an invasion of RNA virus has been rapidly growing over the last decade.

Results: : Patients with critical COVID-19 had comorbidities (87.5%), and the main symptoms were low or moderate fever (75%), cough and expectoration (68.75%), and multiple lesions in both lungs (100%). 2. Patients with critical COVID-19 were divided into the non-surviving and surviving groups, and the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly different (P<0.05). 3. On chest CT, multiple patchy lesions were observed in both lungs, mainly as patchy infected lesions, partial consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial changes. 4. There were 10 patients (62.5%) who survived and 6 (37.5%) who died. Conclusion: Critical COVID-19 is mainly characterized by low or moderate fever, cough and sputum and often occurs in people with chronic disease.Chest CT showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidation. For critically ill patients, it is important to monitor interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CD4/CD8 ratio. Early treatment involves thymalfasin, immunoglobulin and other immune-enhancing treatments, and a large dose of ulinastatin can reduce plasma levels of inflammatory factors.","output":"Analysis of Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, companies adopt teleworking agreements even if they put zero weight on its workforce welfare, as long as the quality of its future product may be affected by current health outcomes of its workers.

We introduce a new method that closely monitors host health and integrity to learn about the infection strategy of Chloroviruses. Our approach combines aspects of spectrometry, plaque assays, and infection dose assessment to monitor algal cells under conditions more representative of the natural environment. Our automated method exploits the continuous monitoring of infected microalgae cultures in highly controlled lab-scale photobioreactors that provide the opportunity for environmental control, technical replication, and intensive culture monitoring without external intervention or culture disruption.

The study objective was to explore the prevalence of IPV, SUD and depression among incarcerated women in a Peruvian prison and explore associations among these variables and related correlates. Methods: 249 incarcerated women responded to a questionnaire about IPV, substance use, depression, and sexual behavior, and were screened for HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Univariate analysis and logistic regression were used to estimate relative risk and the influence of substance use and depression on IPV rates. Results: Twelve months prior to incarceration, of the women with sexual partners pre-incarceration (n = 212), 69.3% experienced threats of violence, 61.4% experienced 1 acts of physical violence, and 28.3% reported 1 act of sexual aggression. Pre-incarceration, 68.1% of drug-using women had a SUD, and 61.7% of those who consumed alcohol reported hazardous/harmful drinking. There were 20 (8.0%) HIV/STD cases; and 67.5% of the women reported depressive symptoms. Compared to women with no experiences of physical violence, a greater proportion of women who experienced least l violent act had depressive symptoms and engaged in sex work pre-incarceration. Depression was associated with physical violence (adjusted relative risk = 1.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.14C1.58). Recommendations: The findings provide evidence of a syndemic of IPV, substance abuse and depression among incarcerated women in a Peruvian prison. To help guide policy makers, further research is needed to determine if this is indicative of trends for other at-risk women in the region, and viable options to treat these women during incarceration to prevent recidivism and other long-term negative sequalae.","output":"Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence, Substance Use Disorders and Depression among Incarcerated Women in Lima, Per"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine factors associated with the utilization of palliative care (PC) in patients with metastatic gynecologic cancer who died while hospitalized. METHODS Data were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample database for patients with cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers from 2005 to 2011. Chi-squared and logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Of 4559 women (median age: 65 years; range: 19-102), 1066 (23.4%) utilized PC. Patients were 24.9% low socioeconomic status (SES), 23.9% low-middle, 23.7% middle-high, and 25.1% high SES. Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance coverage were listed at 46.2%, 37.5%, 11.3% of patients; 36.2%, 21.1%, 18.1%, 24.6% were treated in the South, West, Midwest, and Northeast. Over the 7 year study period, the use of PC increased from 12% to 45%.

Real-time PCR offers rapid results, efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results due to contamination. As a result, better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care. In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use, the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of real-time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens.

In order to successfully reduce drug-related mortality over the long term, policymakers and public health leaders should develop partnerships with people who use drugs, incorporate harm reduction interventions, and reverse decades of drug criminalization policies. CONTEXT Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. Synthetic opioids, predominantly illicit fentanyl and its analogs, surpassed prescription opioids and heroin in associated mortality rates in 2016. Unfortunately, interventions fail to fully address the current wave of the opioid epidemic and often omit the voices of people with lived experiences regarding drug use. Every overdose death is a culmination of a long series of policy failures and lost opportunities for harm reduction. METHODS In this article, we conducted a scoping review of the opioid literature to propose a novel framework designed to foreground social determinants more directly into our understanding of this national emergency. The \\"continuum of overdose risk\\" framework is our synthesis of the global evidence base and is grounded in contemporary theories, models, and policies that have been successfully applied both domestically and internationally. FINDINGS De-escalating overdose risk in the long term will require scaling up innovative and comprehensive solutions that have been designed through partnerships with people who use drugs and are rooted in harm reduction.

Eligibility included patients who had their surgery postponed and had a cell phone that received text messages. Engagement rates were determined using embedded smart links. Patient survey responses were collected. RESULTS: A total of 3,032 texts were delivered. Engagement rates averaged 90%. Survey responses (n = 111) demonstrated that 98.2% of patients liked the text messages and 95.5% said that they felt more connected to their care team; 91.9% of patients agreed that the text updates helped them avoid calling the office. Patients with higher pain levels reported more frustration with their surgery delay (5.3 versus 2.8 on 1 to 10 scale, P value < 0.01).

A 2019 Executive Order- Advancing American Kidney Health (AAKH)- sought to remove indirect costs through an expanded reimbursement program. We examine how potential living kidney donors in the U.S. believe regulation stemming from the AAKH initiative will impact their living donor evaluation likelihood, how these beliefs vary by minority race/ethnicity and prior willingness to be evaluated, and how differences are explained by ability to benefit or knowledge and attitudes. METHODS: Data from a 2019 online survey (Families of Renal Patients Survey) were used. Respondents are U.S. adult (> 18 years) members of the Qualtrics Survey Panel who reported having relatives with weak or failing kidneys (N = 590). Respondents' likelihood to be evaluated for living kidney donation are measured by self-report. Prior willingness is measured by past donation-related actions and current attitudes. Ability to benefit is measured by self-reported labor force participation and financial strain. Transplant knowledge is measured by self-report and a knowledge test, and transplant-related attitudes are measured by self-report. Average marginal effects of minority race/ethnicity and prior willingness for response to each provision in fully-adjusted models were estimated. Formal tests of mediation were conducted using the Karlson, Holm, and Breen (KHB) mediation model. Stata/MP 14.2 was used to conduct all analyses. RESULTS: Majorities of all groups report favorable responses to the provisions stipulated in AAKH regulation. Responses to provisions are significantly associated with race/ethnicity and prior willingness, with racial/ethnic minorities and those not previously willing to be evaluated less likely to report favorable responses to these provisions. Prior willingness differences are partially explained by group differences in ability to benefit and transplant-related knowledge and attitudes, but racial/ethnic differences largely are not. CONCLUSIONS: Regulation stemming from the AAKH initiative is likely to effectively promote LDKT, but may also exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities. Therefore, the regulation may need to be supplemented by efforts to address non-financial obstacles to LDKT in racial/ethnic minority communities in order to ensure equitable increases in LDKT rates and living donor support.","output":"Racial/ethnic and prior willingness disparities in potential living kidney donors' self-assessed responses to advancing American kidney health regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantifying the variations of atmospheric aerosols and trace gas concentrations with the impact of lockdown due to the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is crucial in understanding urban air quality.

Alteplase was not associated with lowered NWU while being associated with reduced edema-corrected tissue infarct volume (-27.4 mL; 95%CI: -49.4 to -5.4 mL; p=0.02), adjusted for ASPECTS and recanalization status. In patients with sET, NWU was 10.5% (95%CI: 6.3-10.5%) for patients with IV alteplase and 8.4% (95%CI: 9.1-12.0) for patients without IV alteplase. CONCLUSION The application of IV alteplase did not significantly alter ischemic lesion water homeostasis, but was associated with reduced edema-corrected tissue infarct volume, which might directly be linked to improved functional outcome.","output":"Effect of Intravenous Alteplase on Ischemic Lesion Water Homeostasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases has been widely recognized for thousands of years, as annual epidemics of the common cold and influenza disease hit the human population like clockwork in the winter season in temperate regions. Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.

Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI: 2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively. Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would be lower afterwards.","output":"[Study on assessing early epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease epidemic in China]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article centers around heterogeneity.

It substitutes the common pipeline of two DNNs with a single model. We designed the ISNet for high flexibility and performance: it allows virtually any classification neural network architecture to analyze a common image as if it had been previously segmented. Furthermore, in relation to the unmodified classifier, the ISNet does not cause any increment in computational cost at run-time. We test the architecture with two applications: COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, and facial attribute estimation. We implement an ISNet based on a DenseNet121 classifier, and compare the model to a U-net (performing lung/face segmentation) followed by a DenseNet121, and to a standalone DenseNet121. The new architecture matched the other DNNs in facial attribute estimation. Moreover, it strongly surpassed them in COVID-19 detection, according to an external test dataset. The ISNet precisely ignored the image regions outside of the lungs or faces. Therefore, in COVID-19 detection it reduced the effects of background bias and shortcut learning, and it improved security in facial attribute estimation. ISNet presents an accurate, fast, and light methodology. The successful implicit segmentation, considering two largely diverse fields, highlights the architecture's general applicability.","output":"ISNet: Costless and Implicit Image Segmentation for Deep Classifiers, with Application in COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the ongoing digitalization and the Big Data trend, an increasing amount of data is available.

This disparity may be explained by several mechanisms including differences in innate and adaptive immune responses, genetic factors, and an interplay between sex hormones and immune effectors, as well as gender-specific behaviour differences. These pathways, particularly the immunological divergence in response to viral infection, could potentially influence not only COVID-19 pathogenesis and disease course, but also the response to antiviral drugs and vaccines.

However, limited research has examined the influence of depressive symptoms on PNF efficacy. This study examined symptoms of depression as a moderator of college student response to a computerized PNF intervention for alcohol use. METHODS: College students (N = 212, 59% female) who reported drinking in a typical week completed baseline and one-month assessments as part of a previously published intervention trial. We randomized participants to alcohol PNF (n = 153) or assessment only (n = 59). We used regression models to examine the interaction between PNF and symptoms of depression on alcohol outcomes at one-month follow-up. RESULTS: One in four participants screened positive for clinically significant symptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms did not moderate intervention effects on drinking quantity. However, PNF was only associated with reduced frequency of heavy episodic drinking and lower probability of any alcohol-related consequence in the context of mild to moderate (not minimal) symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: PNF is more effective than assessment alone in reducing drinking quantity, regardless of symptoms of depression. However, it may only be more effective in decreasing frequency of heavy episodic drinking and the probability of alcohol-related consequences among those experiencing mild to moderate (as opposed to minimal) symptoms of depression.

The pandemic has accelerated the creation of new ECMO centers and has highlighted continuous training in adapting to new pandemic standards. To reach high standards of patients care, we created the first of its kind, National Education Centre for Artificial Life Support (NEC-ALS) in 40 million inhabitants country in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The role of the Center is to test and promote the novel or commonly used procedures as well as to develop staff skills on management of patients needing ECMO. METHOD: In 2020, nine approved and endorsed by ELSO courses of Artificial Life Support with ECMO were organized. Physicians participated in the three-day high-fidelity simulation-based training that was adapted to abide by the social distancing norms of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge as well as crucial cognitive, behavioral and technical aspects (on a 5-point Likert scale) of management on ECMO were assessed before and after course completion. Moreover, the results of training in mechanical chest compression were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 115 participants (60% men) predominantly in the age of 30C40 years. Majority of them (63%) were anesthesiologists or intensivists with more than 5-year clinical experience, but 54% had no previous ECMO experience. There was significant improvement after the course in all cognitive, behavioral, and technical self-assessments. Among aspects of management with ECMO that all increased significantly following the course, the most pronounced was related to the technical one (from approximately 1.0 to more 4.0 points). Knowledge scores significantly increased post-course from 11.4  SD to 13  SD (out of 15 points). The quality of manual chest compression relatively poor before course improved significantly after training. CONCLUSIONS: Our course confirmed that simulation as an educational approach is invaluable not only in training and testing of novel or commonly used procedures, skills upgrading, but also in practicing very rare cases. The implementation of the education program during COVID-19 pandemic may be helpful in founding specialized Advanced Life Support centers and teams including mobile ones.

Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was submitted to patients recruited in France, from both an Ipsos internal panel and AVNIR patient associations. The study was conducted between July and October 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Overall, 2177 questionnaires from patients at risk of infection were analyzed. Almost all respondents (86%, 1869/2177) declared themselves to be favorable to vaccination. Nearly half of the patients (49%, 1069/2177) were aware of which vaccine was recommended for their specific situation. This percentage was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for members of a patient association and for people affected by multiple chronic conditions and varied according to the type of condition. Almost two-thirds of patients (1373/2177) declared having been vaccinated during the 2019/2020 influenza season, and 41% (894/2177) were certain about being up to date with the pneumococcal vaccination. The main barriers to vaccination for influenza are the fear of side effects, doubt regarding the efficacy of the vaccine and for pneumococcal vaccination, and the absence of suggestions by the healthcare professionals (HCPs), as 64% of respondents were not recommended to obtain pneumococcal vaccination. To improve vaccine coverage, information is of prime importance and GPs are recognized as the main HCP to inform about vaccination. Nearly two-thirds (62%, 1360/2177) of patients declared that the COVID-19 pandemic convinced them to have all the recommended vaccines. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the nonoptimal vaccine coverage in at-risk populations despite a highly positive perception of vaccines and confirmed that physicians are on the front lines to suggest and recommend these vaccinations, especially in the current pandemic context, which may be used to promote other vaccines.","output":"Patients Perception and Knowledge about Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey in Patients at Risk of Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fast pace and great pressure of modern life have made people's psychological problems more and more serious The outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has accelerated the development of depression, anxiety, nervous tension and other emotions in all aspects In severe cases, it leads to insomnia In this paper, the impact of the epidemic on people's psychology is extensively investigated by innovative thinking Based on the current design status of existing emotional soothing products, this article summarizes the development trends as well as the shortcomings of sleep aid products, and tries to use new technologies and materials to provide new solutions to problems for people with insomnia Through the design of digital sleep aid products, modern technology is used to meet the practical needs of modern people and to care for the targeted insomniac ?Human-centered computing ?

We collected data from perinatal women at two time-points during the COVID-19 pandemic to test the hypotheses that (1) socio-economic adversities at baseline would be associated with CMD prevalence at follow-up and (2) worse mental health at baseline would be associated with higher food insecurity prevalence at follow-up. METHODS: Telephonic interviews with perinatal women attending healthcare facilities in Cape Town, South Africa. Multivariable (multilevel) regression analysis was used to model the associations of baseline risk factors with the prevalence of household food insecurity and probable CMD at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline 859 women were recruited, of whom 217 (25%) were pregnant, 631 (73%) had given birth in the previous 6 months, 106 (12%) had probable CMD, and 375 (44%) were severely food insecure.

The study aims to assess determinants of the discontinuation of IUCDs among women using family planning in Ilu Aba Bor Zone. Methods: A facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from September to October, 2021 among 168 (56 cases and 112 controls) IUCD-user women in public health facilities in south-west Ethiopia. Pretested, structured and interviewer administered questionnaires were used for data collection. The data were coded, cleaned and entered to Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for advanced analysis. A binary logistic regression was used to estimate the degree of association between the outcome variable and independent variables. Finally, variables with a p-value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval were declared as statistically significant with outcome variable.

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the early manipulation of SBP in non-thrombolised patients. The key hypothesis under investigation was that clinical outcomes vary across ranges of SBP in AIS. METHODS 218 patients were randomized within 12 h of AIS to maintain the SBP during 24 h within three ranges: Group 1 140-160 mmHg, Group 2 161-180 mmHg or Group 3 181-200 mmHg. Vasoactive drugs and fluids were used to achieve these targets. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score 0-2 at 90-days. RESULTS The median SBP in the three groups in 24 h was: 153 mmHg, 163 mmHg, and 178 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.0001. Good clinical outcome did not differ among the different groups (51% vs 52% vs 39%, P = 0.27). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) was more frequent in the higher SBP range (1% vs 2.7% vs 9.1%, P = 0.048) with similar mortality rates. No patient had acute neurological deterioration related to the SBP reduction in the first 24 h. In our logistic regression analysis, the odds of having good clinical outcome was higher in Group 2 (OR 2.83) after adjusting for important confounders. Regardless of the assigned group, the probability of good outcome was 47% in patients who were manipulated to increase the BP, 42% to decrease and 62% in non-manipulated (P = 0.1). Adverse effects were limited to Group 2 (4%) and Group 3 (7.6%) and were associated with the use of norepinephrine (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Good outcome in 90 days was not significantly different among the 3 blood pressure ranges. After logistic regression analysis, the odds of having good outcome was greater in Group 2 (SBP 161-180 mmHg).

In this paper we explicitly propose an alternative vaccination protocol that can be more effective than those already being deployed, as the ones in the European Union [4] and in the United States [5]. We report strong evidence based on an epidemiological model for the importance of contact hubs (or superspreaders), having a much larger average number of contacts than in the rest of the population [6-11], on the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. We show that carefully choosing who will be in the first group to be vaccinated can significantly impact on both health services demand and total death toll, by increasing the overall numbers of lives saved and of hospitalizations. We argue that the approach here considered, which does not coincide with current proposals, and given the current conditions with a lack of basic resources for proper vaccination in several countries, and with a significant reduction in mobility and social isolation restrictions, should be considered by all authorities participating in the design of COVID-19 vaccination with the intent of maximising the number of human lives saved.","output":"WHO vaccination protocol can be improved to save more lives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Provide recommendations regarding vaccination as an essential service at the primary care level in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Immunization throughout the Life Course at the Primary Care Level in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic, 21 May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent clinical trials have now firmly established that inflammation participates causally in human atherosclerosis. These observations point the way toward novel treatments that add to established therapies to help stem the growing global epidemic of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, we now have a number of actionable targets whose clinical exploration will help achieve the goal of optimizing beneficial effects while avoiding undue interference with host defenses or other unwanted actions. This review aims to furnish the foundation for this quest by critical evaluation of the current state of anti-inflammatory interventions within close reach of clinical application, with a primary focus on innate immunity. In particular, this paper highlights the pathway from the inflammasome, through interleukin (IL)-1 to IL-6 supported by a promising body of pre-clinical, clinical, and human genetic data. This paper also considers the use of biomarkers to guide allocation of anti-inflammatory therapies as a step toward realizing the promise of precision medicine. The validation of decades of experimental work and association studies in humans by recent clinical investigations provides a strong impetus for further efforts to target inflammation in atherosclerosis to address the considerable risk that remains despite current therapies.","output":"Targeting Inflammatory Pathways in Cardiovascular Disease: The Inflammasome, Interleukin-1, Interleukin-6 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of mites of the genus Demodex and their associations with host age, gender, workplace, and comorbid skin and ocular conditions were studied in participants in Antofagasta, Chile, which is in a region with an extreme environment.

A slightly higher prevalence was observed in males (51.1%; 95% confidence interval, 40.9-61.3; nonsignificant) and participants in the 69-88 yr age group (50.0%; 95% confidence interval, 23.8-76.2; P < 0.05). Regarding the species involved, Demodex folliculorum was found in 89.1% (CI 82.7-95.5) of cases, while D. brevis was found in the remaining 10.9% of cases. A higher prevalence (25.0% CI 16.1-33.91) was observed in participants who worked indoors in generally enclosed and dust-rich environments (such as theaters, libraries, and administrative offices).

A novel in-situ DED system is presented here, and an experimental study is performed to show that the small-scale system recovers processing parameter trends of a full-scale build. Observed meltpool lengths range from about 200 m to 900 m, while meltpool depths range from about 50 m to 500 m and can support high-fidelity modelling. Additionally, an investigation on the relationship between meltpool dimensions and global energy density GED' is performed. It was found that GED' is not a good predictor of meltpool dimensions due to the discrepancy in linear and exponential trends in laser powder and powder mass flowrate.

Methods: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study with integration at the design and methods level. Phase 1 was a cross-sectional analysis of general and specialty pediatric ambulatory encounters to profile the use of video visits by patient characteristics. We performed descriptive analyses for each variable of interest and estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze factors associated with the odds of having a video visit. Phase 2 was a qualitative exploration using semi-structured interviews with healthcare team members to understand the contextual factors influencing video visit usage. We used an interview guide to solicit information related to general perceptions about ambulatory video visits, reactions to the quantitative phase data, and strategies for optimizing equitable reach of video visits. Data were analyzed using a combination of deductive and inductive analysis. Results: Among the 5,464 pediatric ambulatory encounters completed between March 11 and June 30, 2020, 2,127 were video visits. Patient factors associated with lower odds of having a video visit rather than an in-person visit included being Spanish-speaking (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.20C0.37) and other non-English-speaking (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34C0.75) in comparison to English-speaking. Patients with public insurance also had a lower odds of having a video visit in comparison to privately insured patients (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67C0.88). Qualitative interviews identified five solution-based themes: (1) Promoting video visits in a way that reaches all patient families; (2) Offering video visits to all patient families; (3) Mitigating digital literacy barriers; (4) Expanding health system resources to support families' specific needs; and (5) Engaging and empowering health system personnel to expand video visit access. Conclusion: We identified differences in pediatric ambulatory video visit use by patient characteristics, with lower odds of video visit use among non-English-speaking and publicly insured patients. The mixed-methods approach allowed for the perspectives of our interview participants to contextualize the finding and lead to suggestions for improvement. Both our findings and the approach can be used by other health systems to ensure that all patients and families receive equal video visit access.","output":"Differential Use of Pediatric Video Visits by a Diverse Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To assess the impact of the social isolation index on the number of infections and deaths by COVID-19 in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil) METHODS: Daily isolation data, obtained through geolocation information by mobile phone, were evaluated together with the number of daily infections and deaths by COVID-19 in the state of Sao Paulo The study was conducted from February 26 to May 19, 2020 The data were modeled through the vector autoregression (VAR) model RESULTS: The isolation index has an effect of approximately 5% in variation in the number of infections, and 7% in the number of deaths The impulse response function (IRF) caused a drop of 0 15% in the number of new cases/day, and 0 17% in the number of deaths/day following a shock in the isolation index For both cases, this effect occurred 1 day after the shock and stabilized after 10 periods An increase of 1% in the isolation index led to a reduction of 6 91% in new cases and 6 90% in the number of deaths The 30 cumulative day reduction reached 22 72% in terms of transmission and 35 39% for deaths CONCLUSIONS: The social isolation index is related to deaths and infections from SARS-CoV-2 Although distancing measures are accompanied with impacts on the economy and the emergence of other morbidities, the benefits caused by the reduction in the speed of contagion are significant The adoption of distancing measures has a substantial impact on the number of infected individuals and deaths by COVID-19","output":"The impact of social distancing on COVID-19 infections and deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hungary and Poland have started their illiberal remodelling in 2010 and 2015 respectively Both governments routinely apply the illiberal version of the Rule of Law (illiberal legality), which involves that every situation has the potential to be exploited for political gain Both states opportunistically apply their constitutions and selectively invoke favourable constitutional provisions And yet, this paper claims that the Hungarian Fundamental Law and the Polish Constitution are equipped with adequate emergency measures to provide for a proper framework for emergency legislation In illiberal emergency constitutionalism, Hungary uses and abuses its Fundamental Law, while Poland is disregarding its binding 1997 Constitution and, at the same time, creates its new invisible illiberal constitution This paper explores how it is done during the current human pandemic crisis by focusing on, first, the emergency regimes the constitutions provide for and their (non-)application Second, it compares the operation of the parliaments as the Sejm chaotically passes crisis management related omnibus legislation and amendments on the presidential election during the extra-constitutional 'state of epidemic' The Hungarian Parliament operates under the 'danger of crisis' Yet, it still delivers regular legislative activities, as the emergency 'legislation' is done through governmental decree as per the Coronavirus Act 2020, which is unconstitutional These phenomena necessitate an in-depth inquiry about the nature, form, and content of the Hungarian and Polish emergency legislation and governmental decrees It is concluded that, under normal circumstances, the Hungarian and Polish constitutional measures set for guiding the authorities in emergencies are adequate In the current political and constitutional setting and COVID-19 crisis, the form and the content of some essential Hungarian and Polish emergency measures stay below standards It is a further warning sign for the European community to take Hungarian and Poland illiberal constitutionalism seriously Their pushing the envelope will not end by itself","output":"COVID-19 in Hungary and Poland: extraordinary situation and illiberal constitutionalism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 Intravenous Immunoglobulin (C-IVIG) is an unexplored therapy amidst the rapidly evolving spectrum of medical therapies for COVID-19 and is expected to counter the three most life-threatening consequences of COVID-19 including lung injury by the virus, cytokine storm and sepsis. Methods: A single center, phase I/II, randomized controlled, single-blinded trial was conducted at Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were COVID-19 infected individuals, classified as either severely or critically ill with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Participants were randomized through parallel-group design with sequential assignment in a 4:1 allocation to either intervention group with four C-IVIG dosage arms (0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 g/kg), or control group receiving standard of care only (n = 10). Primary outcomes were 28-day mortality, patient's clinical status on ordinal scale and Horowitz index (HI), and were analysed in all randomized participants that completed the follow-up period (intention-to-treat population). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04521309). Findings: Fifty participants were enrolled in the study from June 19, 2020 to February 3, 2021 with a mean age of 56.5413.2 years of which 22 patients (44%) had severe and 28 patients (56%) had critical COVID-19.

The main objective of the technique is to reduce the critical time period between loss of airway protective reflexes and rapid inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube to minimise the chance of aspiration of gastric contents. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of first-pass intubation success to ensure patient and healthcare worker safety. The aim of this study is to compare the first-pass intubation success rate (FPS) using the videolaryngoscopy compared with conventional direct laryngoscopy in surgical patients with a high risk of pulmonary aspiration. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The LARA trial is a multicentre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Consecutive patients requiring tracheal intubation are randomly allocated to either the McGrath MAC videolaryngoscope or direct laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. The expected rate of FPS is 92% in the McGrath group and 82% in the Macintosh group. Each group must include a total of 500 patients to achieve 90% power for detecting a difference at the 5% significance level. Successful intubation with the FPS is the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints are the time to intubation, the number of intubation attempts, the necessity of airway management alternatives, the visualisation of the glottis using the Cormack and Lehane Score and the Percentage Of Glottic Opening Score and definite adverse events.

Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge.

The prevalence of opioid use, pain, stress, and depressive symptoms as well as associated hazards were characterized among individuals who work in horticulture (nursery and landscape) and those who work in food production (livestock and crops). Qualitative interviews were also conducted to better understand individual experiences with opioid use. Opioid use was significantly higher among horticultural industries compared to food production. Pain and depressive scores were higher among those who had used opioids although stress did not differ. Importantly, substantial percentages of participants who reported opioid use also reported consequences associated with their use, including missing work, being injured at work while using, and having difficulty in completing daily tasks. These results provide initial evidence that opioid use is substantially affecting agricultural industries in terms of mental health, personal health, labor availability, and productivity.","output":"The Effects of the Opioid Crisis on Agricultural Industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy allows in situ observation of nanomaterial dynamics in a liquid environment.

The stress and anxiety levels of respondents were also investigated. The survey obtained 1053 respondents. Additionally, environmental noise levels were measured over 24-h at two locations and compared with results before the pandemic. The results clearly exhibit that environmental noise levels and annoyance due to the noise levels dropped significantly. The annoyance drop was larger in previously noisier environments than previously tranquil locations. Noise annoyance due to neighbor noise did not change significantly; however, noise annoyance due to one's own dwelling increased. The results also confirmed an overall increase in dwelling satisfactions indicating a correlation between dwelling satisfaction and lower environmental noise levels. Although the results confirmed that noise annoyance was positively correlated with stress and anxiety levels, the change of annoyance between before and during lockdown was shown to be independent from the stress and anxiety level.","output":"Noise annoyance during COVID-19 lockdown: A research of public opinion before and during the pandemica)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Very little research has been conducted on brain tumor epidemiology in Pakistan and a few studies that do exist provide regional data only. Conducting population based epidemiological studies in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan can be particularly challenging due to limited resources, poor clinical and research infrastructure, unreliable or incomplete hospital records and a lack of standardization across the health care system. Population-wide studies and registries play an important role in cancer epidemiology and can help identify the current magnitude of cancer burden and its likely future evolution, allowing for better planning of prevention, diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation. This paper describes our experience in designing and conducting Pakistan Brain Tumor Epidemiology Study (PBTES), a first-ever nationwide study carried out to assess the distribution of brain tumors in Pakistan. In addition to the aforementioned obstacles, we were also faced with the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and had to promptly adjust our study accordingly.

Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 2a (Mfsd2a) is a specific marker of the BBB. However, the mechanism by which Mfsd2a influences the BBB is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Mfsd2a is essential for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) export from endothelial cells in the brain. We found that Mfsd2a and Spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) form a protein complex to ensure the efficient transport of S1P. Furthermore, the S1P-rich microenvironment in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vascular endothelium dominates the formation and maintenance of the BBB. We demonstrated that different concentrations of S1P have different effects on BBB integrity. These findings help to unravel the mechanism by which S1P regulates BBB and also provide previously unidentified insights into the delivery of neurological drugs in the CNS.","output":"Mfsd2a and Spns2 are essential for sphingosine-1-phosphate transport in the formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: HIV services, like many medical services, have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are limited data on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV treatment engagement outcomes among transgender (trans) and nonbinary people. This study addresses a pressing knowledge gap and is important in its global scope, its use of technology for recruitment, and focus on transgender people living with HIV. The objective of this study is to examine correlates of HIV infection and HIV treatment engagement outcomes (i.e., currently on ART, having an HIV provider, having access to HIV treatment without burden, and remote refills) since the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHODS: We utilized observational data from the Global COVID-19 Disparities Survey 2020, an online study that globally sampled trans and nonbinary people (n = 902) between April and August 2020. We conducted a series of multivariable logistic regressions with lasso selection to explore correlates of HIV treatment engagement outcomes in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 120 (13.3%) trans and nonbinary people living with HIV in this survey, the majority (85.8%) were currently on HIV treatment. A smaller proportion (69.2%) reported having access to an HIV provider since COVID-19 control measures were implemented. Less than half reported being able to access treatment without burdens related to COVID-19 (48.3%) and having the ability to remotely refill HIV prescription (44.2%). After adjusting for gender in the multivariable models, younger age and anticipated job loss were significantly associated with not having access to HIV treatment without burden. Outcomes also significantly varied by geographic region, with respondents reporting less access to an HIV provider in nearly every region outside of South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that currently taking ART, having access to an HIV provider, and being able to access HIV treatment without burden and remotely refill HIV medication are suboptimal among trans and nonbinary people living with HIV across the world. Strengthening support for HIV programs that are well-connected to trans and nonbinary communities, increasing remote access to HIV providers and prescription refills, and providing socioeconomic support could significantly improve HIV engagement in trans and nonbinary communities.","output":"HIV treatment engagement in the context of COVID-19: an observational global sample of transgender and nonbinary people living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to evaluate both positive outcomes, including reduction of respiratory support aid and duration of hospital stay, and negative ones, including mortality and a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with or without oral darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c, 800/150 mg/day) used in different treatment durations.

Due to slightly different settings of the individual studies, different genes and enriched gene sets are reported in these studies. The main aim of this network meta-analysis was to aggregate a selection of these studies to identify genes and gene sets that are more generally associated with dengue virus infection, i.e. with less dependence on the individual study settings. METHODS: We performed network meta-analysis by different approaches using publicly available gene expression data of five selected studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The study network includes dengue fever (DF), hemorrhagic fever (DHF), shock syndrome (DSS) patients as well as convalescent and healthy control individuals. After data merging and missing value imputation, study-specific batch effects were removed. Pairwise differential expression analysis and subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis were performed between the five study groups. Furthermore, mutual information networks were derived from the top genes of each group comparison, and the separability between the three patient groups was studied by machine learning models. RESULTS: From the 10 possible pairwise group comparisons in the study network, six genes (IFI27, TPX2, CDT1, DTL, KCTD14 and CDCA3) occur with a noticeable frequency among the top listed genes of each comparison. Thus, there is an increased evidence that these genes play a general role in dengue virus infections. IFI27 and TPX2 have also been highlighted in the context of dengue virus infection by other studies. A few of the identified gene sets from the network meta-analysis overlap with findings from the original studies. Mutual information networks yield additional genes for which the observed pairwise correlation is different between the patient groups. Machine learning analysis shows a moderate separability of samples from the DF, DHF and DSS groups (accuracy about 80%). CONCLUSIONS: Due to an increased sample size, the network meta-analysis could reveal additional genes which are called differentially expressed between the studied groups and that may help to better understand the molecular basis of this disease.

The aim of the study was to study the effect of myocardial injury assessment on risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Seven hundred seven consecutive adult patients admitted to a large tertiary hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated in order to quantify the degree of comorbidities. Independent association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increase with outcomes was evaluated by multivariate regression analyses and area under curve. In addition, propensity-score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In the matched cohort (mean age 66.76  15.7 years, 37.3% females), cTnI increase above the upper limit was present in 20.9% of the population and was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality within 30 days (45.1% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.005).

To reappraise the general view that classical texts are remote from modern experience because of the long distance between the era they represent and today, I propose an approach to Greek tragedy viewed through the lens of historical empathy, and of the association between past situations and similar contemporary experiences, in particular. After a brief examination of the concept of empathy, its links with literary reading, and the discussion of these interrelations within the training of narrative medicine, and narrative ethics in particular, the focus turns to selected parts of Sophocles Philoctetes, such as the disease scenean ancient example of pathography. Here Neoptolemus empathy for Philoctetes situation and its consequences are explored with specific interest in the modern readers affective response in connection with their own experiences in medical practice. Neoptolemus ethical conflict, which is resolved by his decision to care for Philoctetes, and the problematic nature of this attitude are both indicative of the aim of Greek tragedy to problematize universal issues and thus to point towards the instability of human life and the fluidity of human nature. Realizing through historical empathy the precariousness of human existence may lead to a better understanding and hence better care for others and open new perspectives in the development of empathy within the context of contemporary medical education and practice.","output":"Historical empathy and medicine: Pathography and empathy in Sophocles Philoctetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Underlying respiratory allergy and experimental allergen exposure reduce the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, which could lead to reduced COVID-19 susceptibility.","output":"Association of Respiratory Allergy, Asthma and Expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor, ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TThe epidemiological emergency caused by COVID-19 led the Italian Government to adopt a series of measures to contain the contagion, which had a serious impact on tourism, the sector most affected by the emergency The restrictions on the movement of people have inevitably had an impact on the activities of tourist businesses, which have in fact reduced their production to zero, and on the rights of buyer of packages travel already sold, due to the prohibition of any type of travel that is not justified by proven occupational needs, situations of necessity or health reasons In this period of extreme urgency, the protection granted to the traveler by the ordinary national legislation, the Italian Tourism Code, seems to be challenged by art 88 bis of the Annex to law 24 april 2020 no 27 converting the d l 17 march 2020 no 18 \\"Cura Italia\\" which, substantially, limits the protection granted to the purchaser of the package with respect to the rules of the Italian Tourism Code, and with respect to the requirements of Directive EU 2302/2015 on package travel and linked travel arrangements, creating a broad debate regarding the remedial profiles available if, due to the health emergency, they are unable to enjoy the trip ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Travel packages and traveler's rights in the Italian legal order at the time of the coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Companies operate in a competitive and changing environment requiring increasingly effective and efficient management strategies.

Design: A Markov model was developed to assess four potential benefits of healthy behaviour for adolescents: better mental health, Type 2 diabetes, higher earnings and reduced incidences of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The model parameters were informed by published literature. The analysis took a societal perspective over a 20-year period. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Setting: Secondary schools. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of adolescents aged 12-13 years. Interventions: An exemplar school-based, multi-component intervention that was developed by the Engaging Adolescents for Changing Behaviour programme, compared with usual schooling. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as measured by cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results The model suggested that an intervention for improving diet and physical activity has the potential to offer a cost-effective use of healthcare resources for adolescents in the UK at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 20,000 per QALY. The key model drivers are the intervention effect on levels of physical activity, quality of life gain for high levels of physical activity, the duration of the intervention effects and the period over which effects wane. Conclusions: The model focused on short to medium-term benefits of healthy eating and physical activity exploiting the strong evidence base that exists for this age group.

The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the psychological impact of COVID-19 among adults and children in the UAE and highlights the significant association between parental and child anxiety. Findings suggest the urgency for policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and especially children.","output":"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults and children in the United Arab Emirates: a nationwide cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Para contener la pandemia de COVID-19 se han adoptado medidas nacionales estrictas de aislamiento social y se han reorganizado los sistemas de salud En este perodo, se observaron cambios en la atencin de enfermedades no infecciosas El objetivo de este trabajo fue describir las consecuencias de la pandemia de COVID-19 sobre la atencin de enfermedades no transmisibles Se realiz una encuesta estructurada retrospectiva a 31 centros asistenciales de la Asociacin de Clnicas, Sanatorios y Hospitales Privados de la Repblica Argentina y Cmara de Entidades de Diagnstico y Tratamiento Se compararon indicadores de abril de 2019 versus abril 2020 Se recolectaron datos sobre consultas de emergencia, ingresos hospitalarios, procedimientos invasivos, tratamiento y ocupacin de reas de internacin En ese periodo las consultas a emergencias y las hospitalizaciones disminuyeron en 75% y 48% respectivamente;los ingresos por angina de pecho y sndrome coronario agudo en 62% y los debidos a accidentes cerebrovascular e isqumico transitorio en 46% Se encontr una disminucin de las angioplastias coronarias (59%) e intervenciones percutneas totales (65%), y un descenso tanto de las cirugas generales (73%) como de las cardacas centrales (58%) Si bien el aislamiento social obligatorio es una estrategia clave de salud pblica para aplanar la curva de propagacin de la infeccin, la marcada disminucin porcentual de consultas e intervenciones podra influir negativamente sobre la morbimortalidad cardiovascular, cerebrovascular y oncolgica Se requiere un esfuerzo conjunto para evitar una posible expansin del da?o colateral del COVID-19 To contain the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), a strict nationwide lockdown has been enforced and the health systems have been reorganized to deal with this entity During this period, changes in the care of non-infectious diseases have been observed Our aim was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the care of non-communicable diseases A structured retrospective survey was carried out in 31 healthcare centers affiliated with the Asociacin de Clnicas, Sanatorios y Hospitales Privados de la Repblica Argentina y Cmara de Entidades de Diagnstico y Tratamiento We compared data for April 2019 versus April 2020 regarding emergency room consultations, hospital admissions, invasive procedures and treatments, and bed occupancy In April 2020, we observed a decrease in emergency room visits (75%) and hospitalizations (48%) A 62% decrease in admissions was noted for angina pectoris and acute coronary syndromes and a 46% decrease in admissions for stroke and transient ischemic attack A meaningful decrease was found in coronary angioplasties (59%) and total percutaneous interventions (65%), and also a decrease in general surgeries (73%), and cardiac surgeries (58%) Although social distancing measures are a key public health strategy to flatten the infection curve, the observed decrease in medical visits and interventions may impact negatively on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and cancer related morbidity and mortality A collective effort is required to avoid the unintended consequences and collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Da?o colateral de la pandemia por COVID-19 en centros privados de salud de Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may present a significant hypoxemia.

OBJECTIVES Evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with changes in manuscript acceptance rates among pulmonary/critical care journals, and gender-based disparities in these rates. METHODS We analyzed first, senior, and corresponding-author gender (female vs. male, identified by matching first names in a validated Genderize database) of manuscripts submitted to four pulmonary/critical care journals between 1/1/18-12/31/20. We constructed interrupted time series regression models to evaluate whether the proportion of female first and senior authors of non-COVID-19 original research manuscripts changed with the pandemic. Next, we performed multivariable logistic regressions to evaluate the association of author gender with acceptance of original research manuscripts. RESULTS Among 8,332 original research submissions, women comprised 39.9% and 28.3% of first and senior authors, respectively. We found no change in the proportion of female first or senior-authors of non-COVID-19 or COVID-19-submitted research manuscripts during the COVID-era. Non-COVID-19 manuscripts submitted during the COVID-era had reduced odds of acceptance, regardless of author gender (first-author: adjustedOR [aOR]0.46 [95%CI0.36-0.59]; senior-author: aOR0.46 [95%CI0.37-0.57]).

Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity and diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.","output":"Does inflammation link stress to poor COVID-19 outcome?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities.

The first cycle consisted of designing a first version of the tool and evaluating its use throughout a case study involving 5 managers and 124 teaching staff members who participated in a 3-year continuous improvement process in one Latin American university. The second cycle consisted of redesigning the tool according to the lessons learned during the first cycle and evaluating its use throughout workshops with 16 managers and 9 teaching staff members in two Latin American universities. Findings indicate that the CA tool helped teachers collect a greater number and variety of evidence regarding students attainment of competencies, allowing staff to be more aware of the learning situation of their students when redesigning course assessment methods and course sequences. Currently, this CA tool is being used by 20 Latin American universities, guiding curriculum renewal strategies beyond the current global pandemic.

The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.","output":"2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has somehow affected the lives of 80% of the world's population.

The aims of this study were to assess whether HBP is involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and, if so, whether it can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test. METHODS: This was a prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers in patients admitted to Sk?ne University hospital in Sweden with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected within 72h after admission, during hospital stay and at discharge. Plasma HBP concentrations samples were measured both with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and with a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Joinstar) point-of-care test. RESULTS: Thirty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-nine patients had blood samples taken within 72h after admission. We compared the highest HBP value taken within 72h after admission in patients who eventually developed organ dysfunction (n = 23) compared to those who did not (n = 6), and found that HBP was significantly elevated in those who developed organ dysfunction (25.0 ng/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 16.6-48.5) vs 10.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.8-21.7 ng/mL), p = 0.03). Point-of-care test measurements correlated well with ELISA measurements (R = 0.83). HBP measured by the POC device predicted development of COVID-induced organ dysfunction with an AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: HBP is elevated prior to onset of organ dysfunction in patients with severe COVID-19 using a newly developed point-of-care test and hence HBP could be used in a clinical setting as a prognostic marker in COVID-19.","output":"Heparin binding protein in severe COVID-19-A prospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic with a wide reach and explosive magnitude, and the world has been bracing itself for impact. Many have lost their jobs and savings, and many are homeless. For better or worse, COVID-19 has permanently changed our lives. For college students, the pandemic means giving up most of the on-campus experience in the postpandemic era and performing online learning instead. Virtual lessons may become a permanent part of college education. Large-scale online learning typically utilizes interactive live video streaming. In this study, we analyzed a codec and video streaming transmission protocol using artificial intelligence. First, we studied an intraframe prediction optimization algorithm for the H.266 codec based on long short-term memory networks. In terms of video streaming transmission protocols, real-time communication optimization based on Quick UDP Internet connections and Luby Transform codes is proposed to improve the quality of interactive live video streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms three benchmarks in terms of video streaming quality, video streaming latency, and average throughput. ? 2021 Cong Wang.","output":"A Novel Model for Large-Scale Online College Learning in Postpandemic Era: AI-Driven Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary, the authors reflect on the successes and challenges of Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons learned.","output":"Letter From Australia: A Never-Ending Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral responses such as social distancing are important in the fight to contain COVID\\\\19 transmission, yet motivating such responses is an overwhelming, resource\\\\intensive task.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of two biosurfactants (BS), produced by Lactobacillus crispatus BC1 and Lactobacillus gasseri BC9, on the skin permeation profile of hydrocortisone (HC, model drug). HC aqueous solubility and in vitro diffusion studies through porcine skin were performed in the presence of BC1-BS and BC9-BS at concentrations below and above critical micellar concentrations (CMC). Moreover, skin hydration tests and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis were performed to further investigate BS interaction with the outermost layer of the skin. Both BS increased HC solubility, especially at concentrations above their CMC. At concentrations below the CMC, drug permeation through the skin was improved, as the result of a dual effect: a) the formation of a superficial lipophilic environment, as confirmed by the reduction in skin hydration and b) the interaction between BS and the stratum corneum (SC), as demonstrated by the DSC curves. From the obtained data, it appears that BC1-BS and BC9-BS could represent new promising green excipients for drug permeation enhancement through the skin.","output":"Influence of Lactobacillus Biosurfactants on Skin Permeation of Hydrocortisone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the influence of tail risks on global financial markets, which aids in better understanding of the emergence of COVID-19.

As this delay risks worsening symptoms, an alternative could be to provide an intervention that requires minimal resources during the waiting period. AIMS: The aim was to investigate if a digital problem-solving intervention delivered in a self-guided format with automated features is feasible to provide for patients on the waiting list in routine psychiatric care. METHOD: A total of 12 patients with symptoms of depression or anxiety on the waiting list for treatment in routine psychiatric care were given access to a self-guided and monitored digital problem-solving intervention over 4 weeks. Primary outcome measures were treatment credibility and usability. Secondary outcome measures were behavioural engagement, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and negative effects. RESULTS: A majority of participants rated the intervention as both credible and usable. The intervention was used at least once by nine out of 12 individuals, with an average of 11 logins. The participants did, on average, initiate 2.8 problem-solving attempts and 10.1 solutions. A few participants reached a clinically relevant symptom improvement of depression and anxiety.

However, the pathological process and probable mechanism remain unexplained. This study investigated the impact of periodontitis on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes rats' carotid artery. METHODS: We randomized 24 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats into four groups: control, chronic periodontitis (CP), diabetes mellitus (DM), and DM +CP groups. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c ) were measured to verify the establishment of the DM model. After euthanasia, the maxillary was collected for further studies like hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Masson staining, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT)-related markers in carotid artery wall. We further used ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the effect of high glucose (HG) and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P.g-LPS) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). RESULTS: Compared with DM and CP groups, bone resorption and pathological changes of the vascular wall were the most serious in the DM+CP group. The vascular wall of the DM+CP group had a higher level of interleukin (IL)-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). The carotid artery vascular wall of the DM+CP group contained more cells that expressed both mesenchymal and endothelial cell markers, along with elevated transcription factor levels. Furthermore, P.g-LPS and HG upregulated the inflammatory cytokines expression and caused phenotypic changes of HUVECs in vitro.

The four categories are: emerging diseases; global infectious disease; deliberate release of chemical and biological materials; violence, conflict, and humanitarian emergencies. Two other categories of common concern are natural disasters and environmental change, as well as chemical and radioactive accidents. The final two categories, food insecurity and poverty, are discussed less frequently. Nevertheless, food security is emerging as an increasingly important issue in public health.

Like ACE, ACE2 is an integral (type I) membrane zinc metallopeptidase, which exists as an ectoenzyme. ACE2 is less widely distributed than ACE in the body, being expressed at highest concentrations in the heart, kidney and testis. ACE2 also differs from ACE in its substrate specificity, functioning exclusively as a carboxypeptidase rather than a peptidyl dipeptidase. A key role for ACE2 appears to be emerging in the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1C7), allowing it to act as a counter-balance to the actions of ACE. ACE2 has been localised to the endothelial and epithelial cells of the heart and kidney where it may have a role at the cell surface in hydrolysing bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II present in the circulation. A role for ACE2 in the metabolism of other biologically active peptides also needs to be considered. ACE2 also serendipitously appears to act as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Studies usingace2 (?/?) mice, and other emerging studiesin vivo andin vitro, have revealed that ACE2 has important functions in cardiac regulation and diabetes.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","output":"Flash survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections in paediatric patients on anticancer treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare early changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone between newborns with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and newborns without CHD.

Cases with CHD were admitted following birth to a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit and had archived continuous ECG data. Control infants were prospectively enrolled at birth. ECG data in cases and controls were analyzed for HRV in the time and frequency domains at 24 h of age. We analyzed the following HRV metrics: alpha short ((s)), alpha long ((L)), root mean square short and long (RMS(s) and RMS(L)), low-frequency (LF) power, normalized LF (nLF), high-frequency (HF) power, and normalized HF (nHF). We used ANOVA to compare HRV metrics between groups and to control for medication exposures.

METHODS From routine monitoring data collected in the capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province, we extracted and analyzed the incidences of influenza; hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD); varicella; mumps; pertussis; and hepatitis B. We also investigated the changes in public behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic through telephone interviews and questionnaire surveys. RESULTS Compared with the baseline (2017-2019), the incidences of all VPDs except influenza declined significantly in 2020 (HFMD decreased by 79.92%, varicella decreased by 7.71%, mumps decreased by 2.03%, pertussis decreased by 78.91%, and hepatitis B decreased by 0.31%). The reduction in reported cases in children (0-14 years) was greater than that in adults, and pertussis had the largest reduction (approximately 80%) in children.

The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN- production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN- release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.","output":"Immunomodulatory Potential of Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived Exosomes on in vitro Stimulated T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Germany esophageal cancer is mostly treated in specialized centers according to national and international guidelines in a multimodal and interdisciplinary setting.

METHODS Twenty-six patients with XLH (age 3.1-25.7 years) were enrolled in Pediatric Endocrine Unit; nine of them were receiving human monoclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 antibody (burosumab) and 17 (pediatric patients, age 9.5-17.9 years, n=7; young-adult patients, age 20.1-25.7 years, n=10) received conventional treatment with inorganic oral phosphate salts and active vitamin D metabolites. A Covid-19 free pathway was addressed for XLH patients receiving burosumab treatment in hospital. XLH patients receiving conventional treatment were followed by phone calls, e-mails, or telemedicine. RESULTS All XLH patients receiving burosumab continued the scheduled follow-up and treatment; none of them was infected by Covid-19. Seven XLH patients out of 17 (41%) receiving conventional treatment showed some complication related to the disease itself or its treatment: periapical abscess with gingival fistula was diagnosed in five patients (three children and two young-adults) and treated with antibiotics with complete resolution; one child showed abdominal pain due to the administration of high doses of inorganic oral phosphate salts solved by reducing the dosage, and one child had severe legs pain during deambulation after orthopedic surgery solved with common analgesics. CONCLUSIONS Covid-19 free pathway was safe and effective to manage XLH patients receiving burosumab.

PGG and PAC have dose-dependent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells. PGG has a lower IC(50) (15.02  0.75 M) than PAC (25.90  0.81 M), suggesting that PGG has better inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 than PAC.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies may have increased overdose risk for people who use drugs by impacting social, community, and structural factors. METHODS: The study included a quantitative survey focused on COVID-19 administered to 50 people who use drugs and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 17 people who use drugs, 12 of whom also participated in the quantitative survey. Descriptive statistics were run for the quantitative data. Qualitative coding was line-by-line then grouped thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated during analysis. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate how COVID-19 disruptions at the structural and community level affected outcomes related to mental health and drug use at the individual level. Themes that emerged from the qualitative interviews were (1) lack of employment opportunities, (2) food and housing insecurity, (3) community stigma impacting health service use, (4) mental health strains, and (5) drug market disruptions. Structural and community changes increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness on the individual level, as well as changes in drug use patterns, all of which are likely to increase overdose risk. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation strategies aimed at curbing infection, disrupted communities and lives of people who use drugs. These disruptions altered individual drug use and mental health outcomes, which could increase risk for overdose.

Rapid antigen tests for infectious diseases are useful to prevent the pandemic spread in clinical settings. Methods We evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, Espline? SARS-CoV-2 reagent, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as reference test, using 129 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from COVID-19 hospitalized patients or from patients suspected having COVID-19-like symptoms. Out of these, 63 RT-PCR positive and 66 RT-PCR negative specimens were identified. Results Among 63 RT-PCR positive specimens, 25 were positive in the Espline test. Test sensitivity was estimated based on the 532.4 copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained through receiver operating characteristic analysis. When the specimens were classified based on time since symptom onset, Espline test sensitivity were 73.3% and 29.2% in specimens collected before day 9 and after day 10, respectively. Conclusion Although the overall sensitivity of the Espline? SARS-CoV-2 reagent compared with RT-PCR is less, this antigen test can be useful in identifying people with high risk of virus transmission with high viral loads in order to prevent the pandemic and is useful for diagnosing COVID-19 within 30 minutes.","output":"Evaluation of Clinical Utility of Novel Coronavirus Antigen Detection Reagent, Espline?

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands. The choice of plants and bacterial species is however crucial, and the system efficiency relies on species-specific, sediment-specific and pollutant-specific principles. More research is encouraged to identify genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that can help us harness effective plant-microbe interplay in wetlands for the successful removal of PFASs from the environment.","output":"Removal of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) by wetlands: Prospects on plants, microbes and the interplay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed health care inequities in the United States and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of individuals. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as an opportunity to evaluate whether the Index contained the correct array of variables that influence countries abilities to respond to these threats; assess additional variables that may influence preparedness; and examine how the impact of preparedness components change during public health crises. METHODS: Linear regression models were examined to determine the relationship between excess mortality per capita for the first 500 days of countries COVID-19 pandemic and internal Index variables, as well as external variables including social cohesion; island status; perceived corruption; elderly population size; previous epidemic experience; stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions; and social and political polarisation. RESULTS: COVID-19 outcomes were significantly associated with sociodemographic, political and governance variables external to the 2019 Index: social cohesion, reduction in social polarisation and reduced perceptions of corruption were consistently correlated with reduced excess mortality throughout the pandemic. The association of other variables assessed by the Index, like epidemiological workforce robustness, changed over time. Fixed country features, including geographic connectedness, larger elderly population and lack of prior coronavirus outbreak experience were detrimental to COVID-19 outcomes. Finally, there was evidence that countries that lacked certain capacities were able to develop these over the course of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Additional sociodemographic, political and governance variables should be included in future indices to improve their ability to characterise preparedness. Fixed characteristics, while not directly addressable, are useful for establishing countries inherent risk profile and can motivate those at greater risk to invest in preparedness. Particular components of preparedness vary in their impact on outcomes over the course of the pandemic, which may inform resource direction during ongoing crises.

A systematic review found that Black and Hispanic patients experience disproportionate COVID-19 hospitalizations and higher morbidity and mortality. Low level evidence in that review suggested that Asians' outcomes are similar to those of non-Hispanic whites. As most practicing gastroenterologists are White, and as endoscopies are aerosolizing procedures risking viral transmission, this study evaluates differences in fear levels among gastroenterologists from different racial backgrounds. Methods: This IRB-approved multi-center cross-sectional study used a snowball sampling approach to disseminate a 42-question survey, pilot-tested for reliability and validity, to gastroenterologists across different geographic locations in the US. Fear levels during endoscopic procedures on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients were assessed using a 1-10 Likert scale, with 10 being the greatest fear. Fear was assessed at three points for upper and lower endoscopies: first procedure, subsequent before the COVID-19 vaccine, and subsequent after the vaccine. Data was analyzed using Pearson's chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon rank tests and significance was determined at p<0.05 Results: We analyzed 69 responses from gastroenterologists at 30 sites. Of the respondents, 39 selfidentified as white, 3 as Black, 6 as Latinx, 4 as Middle Eastern, and 17 as Asian. Due to the small sample size, non-White racial groups were combined to evaluate the impact of race on reported fear level reported by gastroenterologists who performed endoscopies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fear levels at the six assessed points were not significantly different when comparing Asians to Whites, and when comparing Blacks and Latinx to Whites. However, Asians, Blacks, and Latinx had a higher fear level post vaccine when performing lower endoscopies compared to Whites (mean (m) 53.59, standard deviation (SD)=2.83 vs m=1.94, SD=1.083, respectively;P=0.045). Conclusion: While results can be due to chance due to the small sample size and survey response bias, our study suggests that after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, minority endoscopists experienced greater fear than White endoscopists while performing lower endoscopies. It is possible that the disproportionate COVID-19 disease burden in Black and Hispanic communities negates the decrease in fear levels that was experienced by White endoscopists even after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine..","output":"Differences in gastroenterologists' self-reported race affect fear levels during endoscopic procedures: Results from a us national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential threat to professional sporting events when they eventually return to their usual calendar with spectators capacity of football stadiums usually exceeding 40,000 seats for important events.

The single-chamber RT-RPA reaction components are mixed with running buffer, and then delivered to the LF detection strips for biotin- and FAM-labelled amplified analyte sequences, which can provide easily interpreted positive or negative results. Testing requires only a simple nucleic acid extraction and loading, then incubation to obtain results, approximately 30 minutes in total. SARS-CoV-2 armored RNA particles were used to validate the MI-IF-RPA system, which showed a limit of detection of 1 copy per L, or 30 copies per sample.

Although the actors in the coffee value chain absorbed these shocks and could withstand them, adaptation to the disruptions has been challenging for small-scale farmers. Despite the vulnerability to unexpected external shocks, results indicate that a long-term transformation of the sector to build resilience is likely to be slow.","output":"Building Resilient Value Chains After the Impact of the COVID-19 Disruption: Challenges for the Coffee Sector in Central America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transformers have dominated the field of natural language processing, and recently impacted the computer vision area. In the field of medical image analysis, Transformers have also been successfully applied to full-stack clinical applications, including image synthesis/reconstruction, registration, segmentation, detection, and diagnosis. Our paper presents both a position paper and a primer, promoting awareness and application of Transformers in the field of medical image analysis. Specifically, we first overview the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into Transformers and other basic components. Second, we give a new taxonomy of various Transformer architectures tailored for medical image applications and discuss their limitations. Within this review, we investigate key challenges revolving around the use of Transformers in different learning paradigms, improving the model efficiency, and their coupling with other techniques. We hope this review can give a comprehensive picture of Transformers to the readers in the field of medical image analysis.","output":"Transformers in Medical Image Analysis: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse childhood experiences, which is defined by different forms of abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction occurring before the age of 18 years, is a major public health problem in the United States that has the potential to worsen in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

This report describes the clinical features of H1N1 and their prevalence from non-confirmed subjects according to seroprevalence status in Mxico. The objective was to determine the prevalence of these clinical features from non-confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 and to compare them according to seroprevalence status in northern Monterrey, Mxico, during 2009, and to identify the predictive signs and symptoms; there have been no prior serologic studies in Mxico. METHODS During November-December 2009, 2,222 volunteers, ages 6-99 years, were categorized into 3 symptomatic groups: influenza-like illness, respiratory illness, and non-respiratory illness. Antibodies against influenza A/H1N1/2009 were determined by a virus-free enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Demographics and clinical presentation were assessed through face-to-face questionnaire, and the association with seroprevalence status was determined and compared. RESULTS Overall seroprevalence was 39%. Of the seropositive subjects, 67% were symptomatic and 33% were asymptomatic. Seventy-one percent of seropositive symptomatic subjects reported respiratory illness, 17% reported non-respiratory symptoms, and 12% reported influenza-like illness. The most common symptoms were rhinorrhea/nasal congestion (93%) and headache (83%). No significant difference was found between the symptom profiles of the seropositive group, compared to the seronegative one, nor of the median duration of symptoms. The seropositive group had a significantly elevated proportion of influenza-like illness (12%), compared to the seronegative group (8%). The proportion of subjects who took days off and who sought medical attention was significantly higher in the seropositive group. No single symptom was associated as a predictor of seropositiveness. CONCLUSIONS One third of the seropositive subjects were asymptomatic, and few had an influenza-like illness. No difference was found in the symptom profiles of the seropositive and seronegative groups. No single symptom predicted seropositiveness.

AIM: To identify clinical and demographic risk factors for sub-optimal end-of-life care and pandemic-related challenges prior to death and in early bereavement, to inform clinical practice, policy and bereavement support. DESIGN: Online national survey of adults bereaved in the UK (deaths between 16 March 2020 and 2 January 2021), recruited via media, social media, national associations and organisations. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 711 participants, mean age 49.5 (SD 12.9, range 18C90). 628 (88.6%) were female. Mean age of the deceased was 72.2 (SD 16.1, range miscarriage to 102 years). 311 (43.8%) deaths were from confirmed/suspected COVID-19. RESULTS: Deaths in hospital/care home increased the likelihood of poorer experiences at the end of life; for example, being unable to visit or say goodbye as wanted (p < 0.001). COVID-19 was also associated with worse experiences before and after death; for example, feeling unsupported by healthcare professionals (p < 0.001), social isolation/loneliness (OR = 0.439; 95% CI: 0.261C0.739), and limited contact with relatives/friends (OR = 0.465; 95% CI: 0.254C0.852). Expected deaths were associated with a higher likelihood of positive end-of-life care experiences. The deceased being a partner or child also increased the likelihood of positive experiences, however being a bereaved partner strongly increased odds of social isolation/loneliness, for example, OR = 0.092 (95% CI: 0.028C0.297) partner versus distant family member.

HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5' noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples). Typing was completed for 101 samples and 103 HRVs were identified. Surprisingly, 54 (52.4%) HRVs did not match any of the known serotypes and had 12C35% nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference HRVs. Of these novel viruses, 9 strains (17 HRVs) segregated from HRVA, HRVB and human enterovirus into a distinct genetic group (C). None of these new strains could be cultured in traditional cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: By molecular analysis, over 50% of HRV detected in sick infants were previously unrecognized strains, including 9 strains that may represent a new HRV group. These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains is considerably larger than the 101 serotypes identified with traditional diagnostic techniques, and provide evidence of a new HRV group.","output":"A Diverse Group of Previously Unrecognized Human Rhinoviruses Are Common Causes of Respiratory Illnesses in Infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 puts patients with other medical problems at risk of severe illness and death.

These patients had no evidence of respiratory or influenza-like illness on admission and developed symptoms, with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results, more than 7 days after admission (>14 days for 38 [5.7%] patients). Forty (88.9%) of these patients had shared a ward with a confirmed COVID-19 case prior to testing positive.

Stress experience is accompanied by changes in autonomic regulation and, as a result, a number of somatic shifts. Stress markers include sleep disorders, changes in appetite, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, chest pain, dyspnea, body pain, dizziness, numbness, fluctuations in blood pressure, sleep disorders, panic attacks, depressive and suicidal tendencies. Objective. We suggested that resilience is the predictor of successful resolution of existential crisis from the point of view of maintaining mental and somatic health, as well as gaining experience of deep self-improvement, strengthening of personality and potential for coping with life difficulties. Resilience includes coping at all levels of functioning physical, psychological, social and existential. The latter defines the perception of reality itself as a challenge of complexity that requires coping, and regulates resilience at all other levels. The indicator of sleep quality was used as an empirical criterion to evaluate coping with stress. It is both an indicator and an antistress resource for physical functioning. The hypothesis of the study was the assumption that psychological content of resilience differs in subjects with moderate severity insomnia and with no sleep disturbances during pandemic period. Design and methods. To evaluate this hypothesis during the period of self-isolation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020), an empirical study was carried out on a randomized sample of 93 subjects using clinical and psychological scales. Results. This research resulted in the identification of differences in psychological content of resilience which reflect clinical and psychological characteristics in subjects with moderate severity insomnia and with normal sleep during the pandemic. The psychological content of resilience in respondents without sleep disturbances during the pandemic can be considered as complex and mature mechanisms of personality self regulation that allow of maintaining mental and somatic health, efficiency, ability to develop. Identified features can be used as psychotherapeutic targets in patients at different stages of exposure to stress factors. ? 2021 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

In this study, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is first used. Findings confirm that poverty has a negative impact on CO(2) emissions in the short run and a positive impact in the long run, while both effects of inclusive finance on CO(2) emissions are negative. In order to explore the reasons for the change in the coefficient of poverty, we introduce a moderating effect (ME) model and a dynamic panel threshold (DPT) model. The result shows that the negative effect of poverty on CO(2) emissions diminishes with the moderation of inclusive finance. When inclusive finance crosses the threshold value (IFI = 0.2696), the impact of poverty on CO(2) emissions will change from negative to positive gradually, which verifies the applicability of the Poverty-CO(2) Paradox in China and provides an empirical basis for breaking the Poverty-CO(2) Paradox. Consequently, deepening poverty reduction and pushing the regions inclusive finance to the threshold level are proposed as effective ways to promote CO(2) emission reduction.","output":"An empirical study on correlation among poverty, inclusive finance, and CO(2) emissions in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brazil were diagnosed in February 2020. Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support.

Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges to all EPs, including the challenge of how to prepare for and cope with a pandemic. This subset analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically on the lives of EP fathers. Methods: From May 2 through June 16, 2020, a convenience sample of physician fathers was surveyed on their personal and professional preparedness for COVID-19. Surveys were distributed via the Physician Dads Group (PDG), an international Facebook group covering all medical specialties, LinkedIn, via personal contacts and professional organizations. Results: 260 surveys were completed by EP fathers (Table 1). Of the respondents, 77% were between 30-49 years, 84% were White, 9% Asian, 1% Black;31 U.S. states were represented. 98% reported they had a partner. At the time of the survey, 63% felt they were in a high-density area with 88% having cared for a COVID+ patient. About half had taken steps to prepare personally or professionally for the local impact of COVID-19 (46% and 67%, respectively). EP fathers top two concerns were exposing their partner or their child(ren) to COVID-19, followed by personally acquiring COVID-19. 44% of fathers didnt have to change their schedule to care for children, while 37% did;other fathers did not have school-aged children or already had care in the home. In terms of preparation, about 67% made sure they had adequate food, 60% made sure they were financially prepared, while 46% and 41% obtained PPE for self or family, respectively. To prepare professionally, almost all (97%) educated themselves about COVID-19, 68% self-educated about pandemics, and 72% reviewed critical care literature. The three biggest professional concerns were morale of staff (48%), financial challenges (45%), and health of staff (43%). 37% of fathers felt that the balance between their professional and personal responsibilities worsened, while 17% felt the balance improved. When EP fathers were asked if they wished they did not go into medicine, 67% disagreed/strongly disagreed. When asked if they wished they had not gone into their specialty, 89% disagreed/strongly disagreed. Conclusions: EP fathers felt more prepared professionally than personally for the pandemic. The findings highlight that EP fathers were concerned about their family becoming sick but also concerned with the health and morale of staff at work.

Here we sum our experience in an ongoing 10-year anatomy program, emphasizing the challenges we endured, the hardships and successes in the hope that others can learn from our experience. In February 2010, Bar Ilan University was chosen by the Israeli Council for Higher Education to open a new, fifth, medical faculty. A mere eight months later, the school opened its gates to a class of 70 students in the northern city of Safed. This new faculty, dedicated to establishing connections to the local community, enabled us to develop and implement a new anatomy curriculum. The basic course incorporated frontal lectures, dissection labs, basic systematic physiology, clinical correlation lectures and imaging labs. The initial curriculum included trunk and Head & neck regions spanning 5 weeks. After the first couple of years, the length and contents of the course started to change and adapt according to the needs of our faculty, and by input from physicians as well as students. Over the years student number rose to 100, and the course expanded to 10 weeks to incorporate the entire body aside from neuroanatomy, which is taught in a separate course. Histology and embryology were included; ultrasound hands-on labs were added; and virtual anatomy sessions were integrated to the program. Clinical and physiological correlate lectures were cut down, with the understating, backed by students' evaluations, that this was too early for them, and focus should remain on basic normal anatomy. On the other hand, more time was added to imaging sessions and lectures, as most modern physicians use these techniques in their everyday clinical practice. While originally relaying on retired physicians to serve as dissection instructors, we initialed a near-peer students dissection instructors' program that was met with great success. In the last couple of years our program and indeed the entire medical school was heavily impacted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. While lectures were taken to virtual platform, we decided to continue dissection sessions as normally as possible, with strict mandatory regulations including personal protective gear and keeping students' number within the lab to a minimum of 15, 7-8 students per cadaver. Students were highly appreciative of our efforts, and course scoring was exceptionally high. The last 10 years has shown us that anatomy, a basic and important tradition, could be taught in many exceptional ways, and we should always strive to improve. But perhaps even more important is the understating that we are educators to whom our students look up to, and endurance, perseverance, resourcefulness, and professionalism are just as important as scholastic knowledge.","output":"Summing up 10 years in a new medical school: Per aspera ad astra."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

The change in urban mobility patterns due to the restrictions imposed on the population during lockdown is a phenomenon that can be parameterized and studied from the perspective of spatial analysis. This study proposes an analysis of the guiding parameters of these changes from the perspective of spatial analysis. To do so, the case study of the city of Cartagena, a medium-sized city in Spain, has been analyzed throughout the period of mobility restrictions due to COVID-19. By means of a geostatistical analysis, changes in urban mobility patterns and the modal distribution of transport have been correlated with the evolution of environmental air quality indicators in the city. The results show that despite the positive effect of the pandemic in its beginnings on the environmental impact of urban mobility, the changes generated in the behavior patterns of current mobility users favor the most polluting modes of travel in cities.","output":"Spatial Analysis of Environmental Impacts Linked to Changes in Urban Mobility Patterns during COVID-19: Lessons Learned from the Cartagena Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have illuminated connections between spontaneous chemical reactions that cause isomerization at specific protein residues and various age-related diseases including cataracts and Alzheimer's. These discoveries provide impetus for better analytical methods to detect and characterize isomerization in proteins, which will enable a more complete understanding of the underlying relationship between these modifications and biology. Herein we employ a two-dimensional approach for identification of peptides isomers that also includes pinpointing of the modified residue. Collision-induced dissociation is used to fragment ions in the first dimension, followed by separation of the fragments with travelling-wave ion mobility. By comparing data obtained from both isomers, differences in either fragment-ion intensities or arrival-time distributions can be used to identify isomeric forms and the specific site of modification within the peptides. Synthetic peptide standards with sequences derived from long-lived proteins in the eye lens and isomerization at serine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were examined. Although both dimensions are capable of isomer identification, ion mobility is much better at determining the site of modification. In general, separation of isomeric forms by ion mobility is possible but does not follow predictable trends dictated by sequence or fragment-ion length. In most cases, however, the site of isomerization can be precisely determined.","output":"Two-dimensional identification and localization of isomers in crystallin peptides using TWIM-MS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal antimicrobial use and husbandry practices increase risk of emerging zoonotic disease and antibiotic resistance.

In addition to that, we want to analyze the influence of immunosuppressive drugs in that response, as well as describe the adverse events in this population. Methods: We included 266 patients in a unicentric prospective study. All patients signed informed consent. A serologic blood test was made days before the first dose and 2-4 weeks after the complete immunization. We used Siemens Atellica Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (N) and Vircell Virclia (S and N) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2). If they were discordant, the results were considered as undetermined. The IBD treatment was stable along the study. The statistics analysis of data was done with Stata 16. Results: Basal characteristics are described in table 1. The patients were on treatment with: 15 (5.66%) had no treatment, 47 (17.7%) had mesalamine, 4 (1.51%) had corticosteroids, 41 (15.47%) had immunomodulator, 113 (42.64%) had biologic and 45 (16.98%) had combo.

Methods: After exclusion of other biologics than UST and anti-TNF and missing outcomes, the final sample consisted of 607 CD-patients. Clinical remission (HBI  4) was the predefined endpoint at month 12. Patients were analyzed on a modified intent-to-treat basis (mITT;switchers considered as outcome failure). To reduce the effect of confounders, propensity score (PS) adjustment with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was implemented. A weighted logistic regression was used, and the results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: 343 UST (na?ve: 35) and 264 anti-TNF (na?ve: 175) (ADA 61%, IFX 39%) CD-patients were included. PS removed systematic differences between both groups (mean of both groups: 15% perianal disease, 36% surgical resection, 41% EIM). Overall, the number of switches was lower in the UST group than in the anti- TNF group (Tab. 1). However, the number of switches within 12 months was significantly lower in the UST group only when compared to the IFX group (16.3% vs 27.2%;p=0.045) (Fig. 1). Clinical remission rates at 1 year (Tab. 2) were not statistically different for the overall UST vs. anti-TNF groups (65.8% vs 60.0%). Remission rates were similar for UST vs ADA, while these were significantly higher for UST vs. IFX (61.6% vs 41.8%;p=0.009). Looking at clinical remission in the week 16 responder group (Tab. 3), a statistically significantly higher remission rate was found in the overall group for UST (77.6%) vs anti-TNF (65.4%) (p=0.041), which was mainly driven by the higher UST remission rate in biologic-na?ve CD patients (p=0.026). Conclusion: This 1-year maintenance phase RWE-comparison with UST vs anti-TNF showed remarkably high clinical remission rates in both groups. Also due to a more frequent switching within the IFX group, the clinical remission rate at 1 year was significantly higher with UST than with IFX and higher with UST vs anti-TNF in the biologic-na?ve groups. These results support together with the known favorable safety profile consideration of UST as a first-line targeted therapy for CD.","output":"Serologic response to COVID-19 vaccines in IBD patients: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIF: Analyser les rsultats et formuler des recommandations sur le recours  l'antibioprophylaxie dans le cadre d'interventions obsttricales.

IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune cells and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1?, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-&#954;B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is a NF-&#954;B target, simultaneous activation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-&#954;B activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases.","output":"Interleukin 6 in inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Beitrag untersucht aus Perspektive der subjektorientierten Arbeitsforschung, wie Soloselbstst?ndige die frhe Corona-Pandemie deuten und der Krise begegnen.

Kidney transplantation programs were closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the critical shortage of organs, their short shelf life, and their overall importance to improving length and quality of life for those with kidney disease, this analysis examines the impact of discarding deceased donor organs. METHODS: The net benefit (or harm) of discarding deceased donor organs was measured in projected life years from a societal and individual perspective using a Markov model. A wide range of infection rates, pandemic durations, and case fatality rates associated with infection in wait listed and transplant recipients were examined. RESULTS: Overall, patient life expectancy fell for both wait listed and transplant recipients as the pandemic conditions became more unfavorable. However, the overall net benefit of a transplant during the pandemic was preserved. For example, prior to the pandemic, the net benefit of a kidney transplant over dialysis was calculated to be 6.25 life years (LYs) or 8.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a 40-year old recipient. This fell to 5.86 LYs (7.78 QALYs) during the pandemic. Even assuming plausible but higher relative case fatality rates and risks of nosocomial and donor transmission in transplant recipients compared to wait listed patients, the net benefit remained >4 years for most deceased donor organs.

Optimizing public health system during COVID-19 pandemic requires not only advanced medical and biological sciences knowledge, but also all human sciences related to social, as well as nutritional behavior, and lifestyle practices. AIM: To investigate the effect of COVID-19- quarantine on healthy nutritional behavior and lifestyle practices among Jordanian population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among Jordanian population was conducted using an online questionnaire between March and April 2020. Participants were kindly requested to answer a standardized and validated structured questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height); nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, snakes, water intake), and physical activity behavior were requested. RESULTS: A total of 4473 respondents were included in the study; obese (n = 1135), normal body weight (n = 1561), and underweight (n = 116). During COVID-19 quarantine, a significant increase in body weight (12.9% underweight, 28.5% normal body weight, 36.4% overweight' and 41.1% of obese (p < 0.001) was reported.

Search was limited to English language and full-text articles. A total of 334 articles matching the search criteria were identified by the researchers. Five articles with no restrictions in research design met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. In these studies, it was determined that TM services are an effective method for relieving outpatient services in breast cancer follow-up, breast imaging, screening, routine follow-up, and examinations. In addition, these studies concluded that TM services save time, increase access to care, provide improvement, and increase satisfaction levels. It was observed that the demand of women with breast cancer to benefit from TM services was affected by sociodemographic factors (advanced age and low education level, etc.). It is recommended that TM services be taken into account in the realization of individual care and follow-up services for women with breast cancer.","output":"The Effectiveness of Using Telemedicine to Follow-up Breast Cancer During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dyslipidemia is characterized by increased triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Such an atherogenic lipid profile often predisposes an at risk individual to coronary artery disease with incompletely understood mechanisms. Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is an atypical apolipoprotein. Unlike canonical apolipoproteins that are produced mainly in liver and intestine, apoD is expressed widely in mammalian tissues. ApoD does not share significant degrees of homology in amino acid sequence with other apolipoproteins. Instead, apoD is structurally similar to lipocalins, a diverse family of lipid-binding proteins that are responsible for transporting lipids and other small hydrophobic molecules for metabolism. Plasma ApoD is present mainly in HDL and to a lesser extent in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Genetic variants of apoD are associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Increased apoD deposition is detectable in atherosclerotic lesions of humans with established cardiovascular disease as well as mice with premature atherosclerosis. Moreover, apoD is associated with anti-oxidation and anti-stress activities, contributing to lifespan expansion in fruit flies. Elderly subjects and patients with Alzheimer exhibit markedly elevated apoD production in the brain. Thus, apoD is emerged as a significant player in lipid metabolism and aging. Here we focus our review on recent advances toward our understanding of apoD in lipid metabolism and address whether apoD dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. We will also discuss the functional implication of apoD in aging.","output":"Apolipoprotein D in Lipid Metabolism and Its Functional Implication in Atherosclerosis and Aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development trend of public opinion on the Internet plays a very important role in social stability.

Moreover, the central nervous system manifestations in patients infected with the coronavirus -2019 (COVID-19) have demonstrated cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Hence, OD in COVID -19 necessitates perusal of its' mechanism and available treatment options to avert possible development of neurocognitive sequelae of the pandemic. The article presents a literature review organized from the published information about olfactory training (OT) for OD during COVID-19. The methodology comprised retrieval of available literature from database searches and subsequent scrutinization of relevant information. Inferentially, Injury to the sustentacular cells, possessing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, is an important mechanism causing OD in COVID-19. OD may be prolonged in severe cases of anosmia predisposing to neurodegenerative and cognitive impairment in COVID-19 infection. OT demonstrates an effective treatment for OD based on human and animal-derived evidence through recent studies. It curtails the progression of OD, besides inducing neural rearrangement and changes in functional connectivity in patients receiving OT. Additionally, contemporary reports support that the administration of OT for COVID-induced anosmia is effective and encompasses no significant adverse effects. The present review highlights the prominence of olfactory training as a recommended intervention for OD in COVID-19.

This study aims to explore the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among international college students. Methods: The target population constituted international students pursuing various degrees in Jiangsu Province through an online cross-sectional study. A cluster random sampling was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. The Health Belief Model and Knowledge, Attitude/Beliefs, and Practice Theory served as the underlying theories to understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance. Results: We received 330 responses. About 36.4% intended to accept the vaccine. The acceptance varied across respondents place of residence, program of study, continent of origin, knowledge, susceptibility, severity, benefits, and cues to action (p &lt; 0.05). A multivariable logistics regression revealed cues to action (p &lt; 0.001), the perception of COVID-19 vaccination benefits (p = 0.002), and the perception of barriers (p &lt; 0.001) that were associated with vaccine acceptance.

Discussions with a lay advisory group resulted in the decision to hold a workshop over a secret Facebook group. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a secret Facebook group for co-production activities. In the example presented, the population was women with previous gestational diabetes, the topic was physical inactivity, and the purpose was to develop an acceptable physical activity intervention. METHODS: The researchers created a secret Facebook group with content similar to an in-person workshop that sequentially progressed to develop a programme theory for an intervention. The researcher posted 1C2 times per day for 14 days, and members of the group were invited to comment and discuss the content. Feasibility and acceptability of the group were analysed using Facebook analytics and a post-workshop survey. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants took part. In total, 521 comments were provided in response to 18 posts of varying types (average = 28.9 comments per post). The total word count of participant comments was 21,142 words. The workshop was viewed positively, with 20 of 21 participants saying they liked the workshop somewhat or a great deal, and felt the group was a safe and open environment to share opinions. When asked if they would take part in something like this again, 15 of 21 said Yes. Participants mentioned the format was convenient; it allowed them to reflect on their experiences, and they liked helping research progress. Those who say maybe said it was difficult finding time and depended on what else was going on. CONCLUSION: Using a secret Facebook group as a method of co-production or as a workshop in the research process is a feasible and acceptable method. Social media holds significant potential for co-production and involvement in research for populations who are geographically dispersed or time-constrained, with an uncommon condition or other circumstances where in-person meetings are either not appropriate or not possible.

To provide a fairer test of emotional response against richness-of-encoding explanations of the effect, we aimed at increasing everyday relevance and realism of the survival scenarios. For this purpose, we created two new Covid-19 scenarios, one focusing on emotional response (Covid-19-emotion) and the other on survival strategy (Covid-19-strategy). Both new scenarios were compared to the classical grassland and moving scenarios typically used to investigate the survival processing effect. In Experiment 1, we observed better memory for the grassland and Covid-19-strategy scenarios compared to the other two, but no significant difference between the former.

Refinement for such abstractions is crucial as it allows improvements of a given component without compromising its compatibility with the rest of the system. In the context of session types, the most general notion of refinement is the asynchronous session subtyping, which allows to anticipate message emissions but only under certain conditions. In particular, asynchronous session subtyping rules out candidates subtypes that occur naturally in communication protocols where, e.g., two parties simultaneously send each other a finite but unspecified amount of messages before removing them from their respective buffers. To address this shortcoming, we study fair compliance over asynchronous session types and fair refinement as the relation that preserves it. This allows us to propose a novel variant of session subtyping that leverages the notion of controllability from service contract theory and that is a sound characterisation of fair refinement. In addition, we show that both fair refinement and our novel subtyping are undecidable.

Overall analysis showed the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23C20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38C23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08C3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19C24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 [odds ratio (OR) = 14.24;95% CI: 8.67C23.38] times higher, when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (OR = 19.03;95% CI: 11.85C30.56). Conclusion Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks of COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality in patients with BP and pemphigus and to delineate determinants of severe COVID-19 illness among these patients. METHODS: A population-based cohort study compared COVID-19 and its complications in patients with BP (n = 1845) and pemphigus (n = 1236) with age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects. RESULTS: The risks of COVID-19 (hazard rate [HR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-1.73; P = .691) and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.84-2.98; P = .160) was comparable between patients with BP and controls.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020. Blood and urine laboratory findings related to renal function were summarized, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) were also calculated to assess the renal function. Results: A total of 12 admitted hospital patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, included 3 severe cases, and 9 common cases. Serum creatinine (Scr) was not abnormally elevated in all of the patients, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was abnormally elevated in only 25.0% of the patients. However, compared with the recovery period, the patient's Scr and BUN increased significantly in peak of disease (p-scr = 0.002 & p-bun &lt; 0.001). By observing the fluctuations in Scr and BUN from admission to recovery, it was found that the peak of Scr and BUN appeared within the first 14 day of the course of the disease. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the abnormally elevated rates of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), and urine transferring (TRU) standardized by urinary creatinine in peak of disease were 41.7, 41.7, 50.0, and 16.7%, respectively. The abnormal rates of the calculated eGFR and Ccr were 66.7 and 41.7%. Conclusion: Scr and BUN were generally increased during the course of COVID-19.

Both longer closure times and wound infections contribute to higher medical costs and patient morbidity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore determined whether (1) biologic and treatment factors greater influenced wound healing than the choice of sutures or staples; and (2) different times to closure affected cost when sutures or staples are used in patients with musculoskeletal tumors. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 511 patients who had sarcoma resections of the buttock, thigh, and femur from 2003 to 2010; 376 had closure with sutures and 135 with staples. Data were abstracted on patient demographics, comorbidities, select procedural data, and wound complications. Wound complications were defined by hospitalization within 6 months postoperatively for a wound problem, irrigation and dbridement, or infection treated with antibiotics. We determined the association between staples versus sutures and wound complications after controlling for confounding factors. The minimum followup was 2 weeks. A prospective, timed analysis of wounds closed with either sutures or staples was also performed. RESULTS We found an association between obesity and radiation and wound complications. Wounds were closed an average of 5.3 minutes faster with staples than with suture (0.29 minutes versus 5.6 minutes, respectively), saving a mean 2.1% of the total operating time although the total operating time was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We found no difference in wound complications after closure with sutures or staples, although obesity and radiation treatment appear to affect wound outcomes. Data suggest that time saved in the operating room by closing with staples compensates for added material costs and does not compromise wound care in patients with lower extremity sarcomas.

Fintech services have boosted the number of users during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, to maintain the loyal behavior of consumers after usage, firms need to predict key reasons to enhance their intention to use the service and maintain current consumers in the long term. This study offers a model to assess the components of the perceived usefulness toward Fintech. Data were collected via Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and structural equation modeling was used to predict the factors that influence the intention and loyalty to use Fintech post-COVID-19 lockdown. The findings reveal that the COVID-19 lockdown, trust, data security and privacy, and especially staff services are factors that enhance the intention to use through perceived usefulness. In return, it builds consumers loyalty toward Fintech services and is considered a new normal behavior. This research sheds light on how Fintech firms develop their capabilities and increase their competitive advantages. Both theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.","output":"Examining factors that boost intention and loyalty to use Fintech post-COVID-19 lockdown as a new normal behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a novel idea on incorporating the Moon phases to the classic Gregorian (Solar) calendar time sampling methods for finding meaningful patterns in the stock markets.

Many regions have struggled to adapt to disruptions to health care practice and use systems that effectively manage the demand for services. METHODS This was a cohort study using electronic health records at a health care system in northeast Ohio that examined the effectiveness of the first 5 weeks of a 24/7 physician-staffed COVID-19 hotline including social care referrals for patients required to self-isolate. We describe clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics (age, sex race/ethnicity, smoking status, insurance status), and visit disposition. We use logistic regression to evaluate associations between patient characteristics, visit disposition and subsequent emergency department use, hospitalization, and SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing. PARTICIPANTS In 5 weeks, 10,112 patients called the hotline (callers). Of these, 4213 (42%) were referred for a physician telehealth visit (telehealth patients). Mean age of callers was 42 years; 67% were female, 51% white, and 46% were on Medicaid/uninsured. RESULTS Common caller concerns included cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Most telehealth patients (79%) were advised to self-isolate at home, 14% were determined to be unlikely to have COVID-19, 3% were advised to seek emergency care, and 4% had miscellaneous other dispositions. A total of 287 patients (7%) had a subsequent emergency department visit, and 44 (1%) were hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Of the callers, 482 (5%) had a COVID-19 test reported, with 69 (14%) testing positive. Among patients advised to stay at home, 83% had no further face-to-face visits. In multivariable results, only a physician recommendation to seek emergency care was associated with emergency department use (odds ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-16.39, P = .014). Only older age was associated with having a positive test result. Patients with social needs and interest in receiving help were offered services to meet their needs including food deliveries (n = 92), behavioral health telephone visits (n = 49), and faith-based comfort calls from pastoral care personnel (n = 37). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Robust, physician-directed telehealth services can meet a wide range of clinical and social needs during the acute phase of a pandemic, conserving scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and testing supplies and preventing the spread of infections to patients and health care workers.","output":"On the Front (Phone) Lines: Results of a COVID-19 Hotline."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Human, material, and financial resources being limited, the organization of the care system must allow an efficient allocation of resources. The management of cancers leads to specific and repetitive care for which the reimbursement of transport costs represents a high cost. We carried out an analysis of the additional transport costs, linked to the care of patients in ?le-de-France, in a center other than the radiotherapy center closest to their home. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the ?le-de-France Regional Health Agency, we have created a model evaluating the additional cost linked to transport generated by the care of a radiotherapy patient far from his home. In order to take into account the uncertainties linked to the hypotheses made in the development of the model, we carried out deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes. RESULTS: In the base case, the additional annual cost related to transport was 841,176 euros in ?le-de-France. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis reports a total annual additional cost of 2,817,481 euros. CONCLUSION: Our results are similar to a report from the General Inspectorate of Social Affairs published in July 2011, which then pointed to an additional cost of between 4 and 6 million euros annually. The long-term care of cancer patients from their homes contributes to a deterioration in the quality of life linked to travel times, a delay in the care of potential treatment complications, and the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and bacteria resistant to antibiotics.","output":"Nomadisme des patients traits par radiothrapie en ?le-de-France : notre systme de sant a-t-il autant d'argent  gaspiller ?/ [Nomadism of patients treated by radiotherapy in ?le-de-France: Does our health system have as much money to waste?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supply chain operations are disrupted due to natural disasters or epidemics In the recent period, the supply chain suffers from obstacles and major challenges that affect its stages directly due to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic around the world The impact of this epidemic on supply chain performance is clear in terms of supply, demand, or logistics This epidemic is characterized by a rapid spread, so countries have taken preventive policies in an attempt to limit its spread These policies are direct impacts on the performance of the supply chain in all scopes The extent of its impact varies from one supply chain to another, according to the activities that the supply chain provides In order to provide a more accurate study of the impact of the measures taken to limit the spread of the epidemic, this research presents a proposed framework that evaluates the impact of these policies on the three main aspects of the supply chain (supply, demand, and logistics) The proposed framework is build using BWM and TOPSIS based on plithogenic set Plithogenic set provides a more accurate evaluation result that addresses the uncertainty problem Supply chain aspects were evaluated for the food industry, electronics industry, pharmaceutical industry, and textile industry","output":"Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 prevention policies on supply chain aspects under uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As all viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 acts at multiple levels hijacking fundamental cellular functions and assuring its replication and immune system evasion.

The purpose of this study was to determine the gender-based association of NAFLD and AO with subclinical atherosclerosis represented by coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CAD risk by Framingham risk score (FRS). METHODS: A total of 1,655 participants in a health-screening program (mean age: 49.44 years; males: 70.33%) were enrolled for analysis. Fatty liver and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) were measured via ultrasonography (US) and multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). The presence of CAC was defined as having a CACS > 0, intermediate to high CAD risk was defined as FRS  10%, while the presence of AO was defined as having a waist circumference (WC) of 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women. Participants were categorized into four groups depending on the presence or absence of NAFLD and/or AO. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with CACS > 0 was highest in the AO-only group (overall: 42.6%; men: 48.4%; women: 35.8%); and FRS  10% was highest in the group with both abnormalities (overall: 50.3%%; men: 57.3%; women: 32.4%). After adjustment factors, the odds ratio (OR) for CAC and FRS was the highest in the group with both abnormalities [men: 1.61 (1.13C2.30) for CACS > 0 and 5.86 (3.37C10.20) for FRS  10%; women: 2.17 (1.13C4.16) for CACS > 0 and 6.31 (2.08C19.10) for FRS  10%]. In men, the OR of NAFLD was higher than that of AO [1.37 (1.03C1.83) vs. 1.35 (1.02C1.79) for CACS > 0, 3.26 (2.13C4.98) vs. 2.97 (1.91C4.62) for FRS  10%]. However, women with AO consistently showed increased OR for CACS > 0 [1.87 (1.11C3.16)] and FRS  10% [4.77 (2.01C11.34)]. CONCLUSION: The degree of association of NAFLD and AO with CAC and FRS depends on the gender. NAFLD is more closely associated with CACS > 0 and FRS  10% in men and AO in women, respectively.

METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective, and descriptive study. Data were obtained from electronic medical records. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed by detecting viral ribonucleic acid using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Factors associated with the risk/protection from death were determined using the odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were admitted to the hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years, 60% were male patients, and 54% were white patients. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Sepsis at admission increased the chance of in-hospital death by 21 times (adjusted odds ratio=21.06 [0.79-555.2];p=0.06). The strongest risk factor for death was the development of septic shock during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio=98.56 [2.75-352.5];p=0.01), and one in four patients had multidrug-resistant bacteria. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, neuromuscular blockers, and sedatives were also the risk factors for in-hospital mortality.

Although reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have helped in the diagnosis of the disease, they are not as widely available as chest X-rays. This study aims to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of right bronchial infiltration in chest X-ray in diagnosing COVID-19. Material and methods This was a validation study conducted in a single center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 114 patients were enrolled according to the selection criteria of the study. Consent was waived off on the condition of confidentiality maintenance as per the ethical review board. X-rays of suspected patients were viewed and analyzed by two blinded consultant radiologists. Patients were followed for their RT-PCR reports. Data were entered and analyzed in SPSS Statistics v.23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). Results Among the 114 patients, the mean age was 46.217.3 years and 85 (74.6%) were males. The total number of COVID-19-positive patients were 82 (71.9%) while the patients presenting with right bronchial infiltration (RBI) were 94 (82.5%). RBI was significantly associated with the presence and absence of COVID-19 on PCR (p<0.001) and the presence of comorbidities (p<0.001).

SV-CTPA images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (SV-wFBP) and RV-CTPA images were reconstructed using both FBP (RV-wFBP) and Iterative Reconstruction (RV-IR). Comparison of radiation dose, diagnostic ability, subjective image noise, quality, and sharpness, diagnostic agreement, signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise ratios (CNR) were performed. Mean effective dose was 2.56  0.19 mSv for the RV protocol compared to 5.36  0.60 mSv for the SV. The RV-CTPA protocol resulted in a mean DLP reduction of 52 % and mean CTDI reduction of 51 %.

The effectiveness (VE) of BNT162b2 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection wanes over time, and this reduction is mainly associated with waning immunity, suggesting that the kinetics of antibodies reduction might be of interest to predict VE. In a study of 97 health care workers (HCWs) vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine, we assessed the kinetics of anti-RBD 30C250 days after vaccination using 388 individually matched plasma samples. Anti-RBD levels declined by 85%, 92%, and 95% at the 4th, 6th, and 8th month from the peak, respectively. The kinetics were estimated using the trajectories of anti-RBD by various models.

The trajectories of anti-RBD declines were statistically significantly lower for risk factors of severe COVID-19 and the absence of vaccination side effects. Moreover, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with divergent trajectories consistent with a slower anti-RBD decline over time.

METHODS We developed and administered a \\"MERS-CoV staff questionnaire\\" to study participants. The questionnaire consisted of 5 sections with 72 questions. The sections evaluated hospital staffs emotions, perceived stressors, factors that reduced their stress, coping strategies, and motivators to work during future outbreaks. Responses were scored on a scale from 0-3. The varying levels of stress or effectiveness of measures were reported as mean and standard deviation, as appropriate. RESULTS Completed questionnaires were returned by 117 (78%) of the participants. The results had many unique elements. HCWs ethical obligation to their profession pushed them to continue with their jobs. The main sentiments centered upon fear of personal safety and well-being of colleagues and family. Positive attitudes in the workplace, clinical improvement of infected colleagues, and stoppage of disease transmission among HCWs after adopting strict protective measures alleviated their fear and drove them through the epidemic. They appreciated recognition of their efforts by hospital management and expected similar acknowledgment, infection control guidance, and equipment would entice them to work during future epidemics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 160 individuals were screened, 100 of whom were eligible (T2DM: n=51; nondiabetic: n=49). Participants were classified either as having healthy cognition (HC) or showing signs of MCI. Speech recordings were collected through a phone call. Based on automatic speech recognition, 15 temporal parameters were calculated. RESULTS The HC with T2DM group showed significantly shorter utterance length, higher duration rate of silent pause and total pause, and higher average duration of silent pause and total pause compared with the HC without T2DM group. Regarding the MCI participants, parameters were similar between the T2DM and the nondiabetic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Temporal speech characteristics of T2DM patients showed early signs of altered cognitive functioning, whereas neuropsychological tests did not detect deterioration.

A clinical picture concerning for intraoperative coagulopathy may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection during cesarean sections, and abnormal COVID laboratory tests, particularly D-Dimer, may help identify the patients in which this presentation occurs.","output":"Intraoperative coagulopathy during cesarean section as an unsuspected initial presentation of COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current outbreak of Ebola has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. We performed a rigorous and rapid needs assessment to identify the desired results, the gaps in current practice, and the barriers and facilitators to the development of solutions in the provision of critical care to patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study with an emergent design at a tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada, recently designated as an Ebola centre, from Oct. 21 to Nov. 7, 2014. Participants included physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and staff from infection control, housekeeping, waste management, administration, facilities, and occupational health and safety. Data collection included document analysis, focus groups, interviews and walk-throughs of critical care areas with key stakeholders. RESULTS Fifteen themes and 73 desired results were identified, of which 55 had gaps. During the study period, solutions were implemented to fully address 8 gaps and partially address 18 gaps. Themes identified included the following: screening; response team activation; personal protective equipment; postexposure to virus; patient placement, room setup, logging and signage; intrahospital patient movement; interhospital patient movement; critical care management; Ebola-specific diagnosis and treatment; critical care staffing; visitation and contacts; waste management, environmental cleaning and management of linens; postmortem; conflict resolution; and communication. INTERPRETATION This investigation identified widespread gaps across numerous themes; as such, we have been able to develop a set of credible and measureable results. All hospitals need to be prepared for contact with a patient with Ebola, and the preparedness plan will need to vary based on local context, resources and site designation.","output":"Ebola preparedness: a rapid needs assessment of critical care in a tertiary hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has almost affected more than two million people and has taken more than one hundred thousand lives around the globe. At this current state, researchers are trying their best level to drive the permanent solution for this menace;hence, till now social distancing and hygienic lifestyle are the only solutions. This paper proposes a smart entrance disinfectant gate based on the sanitizer spray station and ultraviolet irradiation mechanisms. This innovative and embedded system design-oriented gate will first capture the image of the entrant, second, measure the temperature, third, spray the sanitizers and, last, provide the ultraviolet irradiation to make sure that the person entering any space may have fewer chances to carry coronavirus. The purpose of this study is to enable the IoT feature that helps the government officials to keep the data record of suspectable, exposed, infected and recovered people which will later help to reduce the reproductive co-efficient Ro of COVID-19 within any state of Malaysia.

However, they raise a lot of concerns for their impact on congestion, Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), and competition with transit. There are also questions about their long-term survival because of inherent inefficiencies in their operations. Considering the popularity of the MoD services, increasing ride-pooling is an important means to address these concerns. Shareability depends not only on riders attitudes and preferences but also on operating models deployed by providers. The paper introduces an advance requests operating model for ride pooling where users may request rides at least H minutes in advance of their desired departure times. A platform with efficient algorithms for request matching, vehicle routing, rebalancing, and flexible user preferences is developed. A large-scale transportation network company dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the advance requests system relative to current practices. The impacts of various design aspects of the system (advance requests horizon, vehicle capacity) on its performance are investigated. The sensitivity of the results to user preferences in terms of the level of service (time to be served and excess trip time), willingness to share and place requests in advance, and traffic conditions are explored. The results suggest that significant benefits in terms of sustainability, level of service, and fleet utilization can be realized when advance requests are along with an increased willingness to share. Furthermore, even near-on-demand (relative short advance planning horizons) operations can offer many benefits for all stakeholders involved (passengers, operators, and cities).","output":"Near-on-Demand Mobility.

Methods: In the current retrospective observational study of patients who visited the hospital at least twice a year for the past 4 years, changes in cardiometabolic factors from the COVID-19 pandemic (2019C2020) were compared with changes in the same cohort at the same annual time points during the previous seasons of 2016C2019. Results: A total of 1,485 individuals with a mean age of 61.8  11.7 years were included in the analysis.

Using an innovative approach combining altmetrics methods with content analysis, we identified a diversity of outlets covering COVID-19-related preprints during the early months of the pandemic, including specialist medical news outlets, traditional news media outlets, and aggregators. We found a ubiquity of hyperlinks as citations and a multiplicity of framing devices for highlighting the scientific uncertainty associated with COVID-19 preprints. These devices were rarely used consistently (e.g., mentioning that the study was a preprint, unreviewed, preliminary, and/or in need of verification). About half of the stories we analyzed contained framing devices emphasizing uncertainty.

Throughout 2020, there were numerous governmental stay-home orders and policies, health care responses, and COVID-19 vaccine development;all of which may have had unintended consequences beyond illness prevention. Here we investigate the longer-term impact over the first year of the pandemic on the incidence of traumatic injuries. Methods: This retrospective analysis was performed with all records of trauma activations from an urban level 1 trauma centers trauma registry. Mean weekly, monthly, and total yearly patient counts from 2017-2019 and total from 2020 were compared using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Shapiro-Wilk and Levenes tests were used to assess normality and variances, respectively. Differences were considered significant when two-sided p-value < 0.05. Results: Of 4157 trauma patients in 2020, 73% were male and average age was 39 years old. There were more trauma patients in 2020 than the 2017-2019 average (n = 3869). No demographic differences were present comparing patients seen in 2020 and those of previous years. In 2020, there were significantly higher weekly counts of penetrating injuries versus the 2017-2019 average (mean [SD]) (22.5 [7.2] vs 17.5 [3.1], p > 0.000), specifically gunshot wounds (GSWs) (15.8 [6.0] vs. 11.3 [2.7], p > 0.0000) and more assaults (23.3 [6.7] vs 19.4 [3.2], p > 0.0003). In 2020, fewer falls (11.9 [4.3] vs. 13.4 [2.5], p > 0.03), pedestrian/bicycle accidents (5.5 [3.1] vs 7.5 [2.1], p > 0.0002) and accidents in general (45.9 [17.1] vs 50.9 [5.6], p > 0.0003) presented to our hospital compared to 2017-2019 average. Monthly totals in 2020 were higher than average in every month except those with strictest stay home mandates in place (March-May). Overall, weekly totals were higher than average in 2020 (79 vs 73) and decreased during the strictest shut-downs from March 18 through the beginning of June (Fig. 1A & B). Conclusion: A decreased number of traumatic injuries presented to our level 1 trauma center during the first six weeks of the pandemic, which coincided with closure of most non-essential businesses and the strictest government-instituted stay home orders. The week that our state and city moved into re-opening of businesses to 50% capacity and opened bars, there were more traumatic injuries than previous years on average. After that initial week of increased patient volume, weekly counts of trauma patients were above average in most (25 / 31, 80%) weeks through the end of the year. Increased GSWs and assaults this year may suggest increased interpersonal conflict due to external stressors caused by the pandemic. Conversely, decreased falls, pedestrian/bike accidents and other causes of accidents may suggest that staying at home decreases activities and associated accident risk.","output":"42 First Year of COVID-19: Stay at Home Decreased Accidents, but Increased Assaults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even as women's roles have expanded substantially beyond traditional sex stereotypes, women are still commonly portrayed as uncomplaining caregivers, long-suffering intimate partners and in control of family matters, all while maintaining a sexualised femininity.

However, the impact of this pandemic on learning and decision-making in students are yet to be fully understood. It is important to gain insights into student experiences during COVID-19 pandemic so that student and institutional resiliency can be improved during future pandemics. This research is part of a larger nationwide inductive research project with the purpose of developing theories to explain the learning experiences and decisions of undergraduate STEM students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed-methods approach with purposive sampling was utilized to enroll 63 undergraduate STEM students from six U.S institutions. Data was collected through recruitment surveys, academic transcripts, and interviews. One-hour ZOOM interviews, gave research participants the opportunity to narrate their salient STEM learning experiences during the spring 2020 semester. Data was analyzed using the NVivo qualitative analysis software and Microsoft Excel for coding, categorizing, memo-ing, constant comparative analysis, and theme development. Also, Microsoft Excel was used to analyze demographic data from recruitment surveys and GPA data from the academic transcripts. Results from the analysis of 30 coded interview transcripts revealed an emergent theme - Professor-Student Interactions Impact Learning and Adaptation Decisions. The three key categories of this theme are: Professor-Student Interactions and Learning Challenges;Adaptation Decisions;and STEM Performance. The seven categories of Professor-Student Interactions are coded as: Online Instructional Delivery Methods;Professor Caring Attitudes;Professor Leniency;Professor Availability;Student Workloads;Professor Technology Proficiency;and Professor Teaching Resources. Positive professor-student interactions improve student learning experiences. Negative professor-student interactions worsen student learning challenges and are coded as: Illusion of Time, Procrastination;Lack of Focus;Challenge of Asking Questions;Poor Understanding;Poor Quality Assignments;Poor Intermediate Grades;Stresses;and Lowered Motivation. While most research participants experienced high stresses, a few of them experienced low or no stresses. To minimize the impact of COVID-related learning challenges on their STEM learning and performance, research participants made effective adaptation decisions coded as: Refined Scheduling;Alternate Learning Resources;Professor Office Hours;Teaching Assistants;Peer Collaboration;Relaxation Strategies;and Pass/Fail Options. Compared to the fall 2019 GPAs, the improved spring 2020 GPAs of research participants may be partially attributed to professor leniency, pass/fail option, and cheating. Findings indicate that while STEM professors were adjusting to COVID-modified teaching and learning environments, many STEM students were developing a sense of self-discipline, self-teaching, and independence. They relied on both professor and non-professor generated resources to improve their own STEM learning and performance. Lessons learned and best practices for improved professor-student interactions and student adaptation decisions are discussed for potential replication in STEM communities for improved adaptability and resiliency during future pandemics. Future research will focus on quantifying the long-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on STEM performance. ?

We determined the level of odor emissions in crematoriums by monitoring the odor concentrations of cremators, incinerators, and cremation workshops in five crematoriums in Beijing. Subsequently, we analyzed the major contributing factors to the odor level and proposed control measures. A high odor concentration in crematoriums was observed; two different mechanisms were proposed to explain this finding. First, poor ventilation conditions in workshops and inadequate airtightness of equipment resulted in dimensionless concentrations of unorganized odor emissions in the workshops ranging from 97 to 732, with an average of 504, which is much higher than the standard level of 20. Second, the postprocessing facilities used in cremation sites produce poor odor removal, which, coupled with fuel usage and unregulated operations, led to high concentrations of organized odor emissions ranging from 231 to 1303 (910 on average) for cremators and incinerators. The odor emissions of cremators and incinerators meet the Integrated Emission Standards of Air Pollutants (DB11-501-2017), which are suitable for industries containing industrial kilns but not for crematoriums. The odor emissions in crematoriums are lower than those emitted from industries, such as fiber manufacturing and activated carbon processing. However, the unique geographical locations of crematoriums, high population density, and high exposure risk to local residents necessitate strengthening the management and control of odor emissions from crematoriums. To further address the problem of odor emissions from crematoriums in Beijing, further clarification and tightening of industry standards for the concentration limits of organized and unorganized odor emissions is recommended. Crematoriums will thus be prompted to increase odor control in workshops and adopt and improve deodorization facilities, including the installation and application of treatment facilities, such as adsorption and biological control.","output":"Characteristics and control measures of odor emissions from crematoriums in Beijing, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les surco?ts pour les tablissements de sant de rfrence (ESR) pour le risque pidmique et biologique (REB) gnrs par la rgulation tlphonique des ? patients suspects ? dinfection mergente et la prise en charge des ? cas possibles ? nont jamais t valus.

However, hospitalist perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and potential differences between APPs and physicians are unknown. Understanding hospitalist perspectives could help to address vaccine hesitancy among patients. METHODS We conducted an online survey of hospitalists at Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from December 14, 2020, through January 4, 2021. We collected demographic information and assessed perspectives on the COVID-19 vaccine and, for comparison, on the influenza vaccine. Descriptive statistics were used to compare responses between APPs and physicians. RESULTS The overall response rate was 42.7% (n=128/300) and comprised of 53.9% women (n=69/128) and 41.4% APPs (n=53/128). Most hospitalists reported receiving or planning to receive vaccination against COVID-19 (93.7%; n=119/128) and influenza (97.7%; n=125/128). Most hospitalists reported they would advise 100% of patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (66% for APPs; 74.7% for physicians) and influenza vaccine (83% for APPs; 80% for physicians). Barriers to recommending the COVID-19 vaccine included patient health status and vaccine safety profile. Hospitalists reported that patients and co-workers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine would reduce their anxiety (~80% of hospitalists), social isolation (~64% of hospitalists), and improve their emotional support (~40% of hospitalists). APP and physician responses were similar. The possible reduction in social isolation was associated with higher odds of hospitalists advising all patients to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (adjusted odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval, 1.32-6.59]; P<.008), whereas hospitalist age, gender, and profession showed no association.

CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the importance of considering thrombotic complications, such as CVT, even in well-appearing COVID-19 patients with no other risk factors for thromboembolic disease.","output":"A Case Report of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis as a Complication of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Well-appearing Patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to reach all those who find it difficult to become well informed about the steps that have been implemented to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to spark discussion and thought Here, we use simple stochastic simulations to evaluate different approaches taken to manage the crisis We then compare these results with updated data of what really happened in the UK and in South Africa The initial simulations aligned well with how the pandemic has evolved throughout five months following lockdown The models are, as expected, not fully accurate, but exact enough to be used as a guideline to the evolution of the disease in both high- and middle-income countries This is shown through simulations formed by an open source code, which allows evaluation of the outcomes from different intervention scenarios or conditions","output":"COVID-19 Modelling: The Effects of Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO 2 emissions of an international cohort of master's students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO 2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO 2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO 2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.","output":"Impact on carbon emissions of online study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on healthcare services all over the world.

Insufficient tumor sampling in CNB is common, primarily due to inadvertent sampling of tumor-associated fibrosis or atelectatic lung, leading to repeat procedures and delayed diagnosis. Currently, there is no method for rapid, non-destructive intraprocedural assessment of CNBs. Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a high-resolution, volumetric imaging technique that has the potential to meet this clinical need. PS-OCT detects endogenous tissue properties, including birefringence from collagen, and degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU) indicative of tissue depolarization. Here, PS-OCT birefringence and DOPU measurements were used to quantify the amount of tumor, fibrosis, and normal lung parenchyma in 42 fresh, intact lung CNB specimens. PS-OCT results were compared to and validated against matched histology in a blinded assessment. Linear regression analysis showed strong correlations between PS-OCT and matched histology for quantification of tumors, fibrosis, and normal lung parenchyma in CNBs. PS-OCT distinguished CNBs with low tumor content from those with higher tumor content with high sensitivity and specificity.

Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities, which was diagnosed as acute respiratory syndrome. The PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio gradually increased from 158 on hospitalization to 300 on Day 11, on which day the ventilator was withdrawn. However, serum syndecan-1 (SDC-1) level gradually decreased from 400.5 ng/ml at hospitalization to 165.1 ng/ml on Day 5. On Day 6, serum SDC-1 level increased to 612.9 ng/ml owing to a systemic thrombosis with an increase in D-dimer. Serum SDC-1 level then decreased until 206.0 ng/ml on Day 11 after a decrease in D-dimer. The patient was transferred to another hospital on Day 21 after hospitalization.

The Spike protein, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possesses multiple disulfide bonds raising the possibility that disulfide-reducing agents might disrupt Spike function, prevent viral entry and serve as effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show the first experimental evidence that reagents capable of reducing disulfide bonds can inhibit viral infection in cell-based assays. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) predict increased domain flexibility when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the surface loop, comprised of residues 456-490, which interacts with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. Consistent with this finding, the addition of exogenous disulfide bond reducing agents affects the RBD secondary structure, lowers its melting temperature from 52 to 36-39C and decreases its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37C. Finally, the reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) inhibit viral replication at high M C low mM levels with a negligible effect on cell viability at these concentrations. The antiviral effect of monothiol-based reductants N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not observed due to decreases in cell viability.

The results of our study demonstrate that within a few passages in cell culture, both the natural isolate of SARS-CoV-2 and the recombinant, cDNA-derived variant acquire an additional ability to bind to heparan sulfate (HS). This promotes a primary attachment of viral particles to cells before their further interactions with the ACE2. Interaction with HS is acquired through multiple mechanisms. These include i) accumulation of point mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, which increase the positive charge of the surface of this domain, ii) insertions into NTD of heterologous peptides, containing positively charged amino acids, and iii) mutation of the first amino acid downstream of the furin cleavage site. This last mutation affects S protein processing, transforms the unprocessed furin cleavage site into the heparin-binding peptide and makes viruses less capable of syncytia formation. These viral adaptations result in higher affinity of viral particles to heparin sepharose, dramatic increase in plaque sizes, more efficient viral spread, higher infectious titers and two orders of magnitude lower GE:PFU ratios. The detected adaptations also suggest an active role of NTD in virus attachment and entry. As in the case of other RNA+ viruses, evolution to HS binding may result in virus attenuation in vivo. IMPORTANCE The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a major determinant of viral pathogenesis. It mediates binding to ACE2 receptor and later, fusion of viral envelope and cellular membranes. The results of our study demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly evolves during propagation in cultured cells. Its spike protein acquires mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and in P1 position of the furin cleavage site (FCS). The amino acid substitutions or insertions of short peptides in NTD are closely located on the protein surface and increase its positive charge. They strongly increase affinity of the virus to heparan sulfate, make it dramatically more infectious for the cultured cells and decrease GE:PFU ratio by orders of magnitude. The S686G mutation also transforms the FCS into the heparin-binding peptide. Thus, the evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently use glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface for primary attachment before the high affinity interaction of the spikes with the ACE2 receptor.","output":"Natural isolate and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 rapidly evolve in vitro to higher infectivity through more efficient binding to heparan sulfate and reduced S1/S2 cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kunststoffe sind in g?nzlich verschiedenem Kontext in den Brennpunkt gerckt: Einerseits aufgrund der verbreiteten Entsorgung auf der Deponie oder in der Verbrennung, der Langlebigkeit in der Umwelt und der Rolle von Kunststoffen als Teil von CO2\\\\intensiven, auf Erd?l basierenden linearen Wertsch?pfungsketten.

During various dental procedures, teeth are subjected to dehydration. The commonly used shade guides are being replaced with electronic color measurement devices for more precise measurements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dehydration time on tooth color measurement using a spectrophotometer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample is represented by 20 extracted caries-free maxillary central incisors, which were obtained from several private clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and soaked in normal saline for 24 hours. The VITA Easyshade Advance 4.0 spectrophotometer was used to measure the color at different areas of the tooth (cervical, middle, and incisal thirds) at three time intervals (baseline, after 1 hour of dehydration, and after 2 hours of dehydration). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All color coordinates across the different areas of each tooth at the incisal, middle, and cervical thirds descriptive statistics of mean (standard deviation) values were calculated and were compared at the different time intervals at baseline, after 1 hour of dehydration, and after 2 hours of dehydration. Finally, the color change value ?E was calculated using the formula ?E*ab = a?? (L2? - L1?)2 + (a2? - a1?)2 + (b2? - b1?)2. RESULTS: The color difference ?E showed statistically significant changes at different time intervals: at baseline, after 1 hour of dehydration, and after 2 hours of dehydration (p < 0.001). Hue had statistically significant changes between 1 hour and 2 hours of dehydration (p = 0.002). Chroma value also showed statistically significant changes (p < 0.001) in all time intervals. CONCLUSION: By using VITA Easyshade Advance 4.0 spectrophotometer, it was indicated that the tooth color measurements were significantly affected by dehydration time, and tooth shade appeared lighter due to changes in the refractive indices as air replaces the interprism spaces within the enamel.

It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19Crelated symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD  12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19Crelated symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p < 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.27C6.36; p < 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19.

A variance-based sensitivity analysis typically produces the first-order sensitivity indices $S_j$ and the so-called total-effect sensitivity indices $T_j$ for the uncertain factors of the mathematical model under analysis. The cost of the analysis depends upon the number of model evaluations needed to obtain stable and accurate values of the estimates. While efficient estimation procedures are available for $S_j$, this availability is less the case for $T_j$. When estimating these indices, one can either use a sample-based approach whose computational cost depends on the number of factors or use approaches based on meta modelling/emulators. The present work focuses on sample-based estimation procedures for $T_j$ and tests different avenues to achieve an algorithmic improvement over the existing best practices. To improve the exploration of the space of the input factors (design) and the formula to compute the indices (estimator), we propose strategies based on the concepts of economy and explorativity. We then discuss how several existing estimators perform along these characteristics. We conclude that: a) sample-based approaches based on the use of multiple matrices to enhance the economy are outperformed by designs using fewer matrices but with better explorativity; b) among the latter, asymmetric designs perform the best and outperform symmetric designs having corrective terms for spurious correlations; c) improving on the existing best practices is fraught with difficulties; and d) ameliorating the results comes at the cost of introducing extra design parameters.","output":"Variance-based sensitivity analysis: The quest for better estimators and designs between explorativity and economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand (L)1, the immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of various diseases including chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as hepatitis, liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

DESIGN Data from a series of random-digit-dial telephone surveys were analysed. A time series analysis tested the association between levels of worry and the volume of media reporting on the start day of each survey. Cross-sectional regression analyses assessed the relationships between likely vaccine uptake or behaviour and predictor variables. SETTING Thirty-six surveys were run at, on average, weekly intervals across the UK between 1 May 2009 and 10 January 2010. Five surveys (run between 14 August and 13 September) were used to assess likely vaccine uptake. Five surveys (1-17 May) provided data relating to other behaviours. PARTICIPANTS Between 1047 and 1173 people aged 16 years or over took part in each survey: 5175 participants provided data about their likely uptake of the swine flu vaccine; 5419 participants provided data relating to other behaviours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All participants were asked to state how worried they were about the possibility of personally catching swine flu. Subsets were asked how likely they were to take up a swine flu vaccination if offered it and whether they had recently carried tissues with them, bought sanitising hand gel, avoided using public transport or had been to see a general practitioner, visited a hospital or called NHS Direct for a flu-related reason. RESULTS The percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried participants fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9%. This figure was associated with the volume of media reporting, even after adjusting for the changing severity of the outbreak [chi2(1) = 6.6, p = 0.010, coefficient for log-transformed data = 2.6]. However, this effect only occurred during the UK's first summer wave of swine flu. In total, 56.1% of respondents were very or fairly likely to accept the swine flu vaccine. The strongest predictors were being very worried about the possibility of oneself [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2 to 7.0] or one's child (aOR 8.0, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.9) catching swine flu. Overall, 33.1% of participants reporting carrying tissues with them, 9.5% had bought sanitising gel, 2.0% had avoided public transport and 1.6% had sought medical advice. Exposure to media coverage or advertising about swine flu increased tissue carrying or buying of sanitising hand gel, and reduced avoidance of public transport or consultation with health services during early May 2009. Path analyses showed that media coverage and advertising had these differential effects because they raised the perceived efficacy of hygiene behaviours but decreased the perceived efficacy of avoidance behaviours. CONCLUSIONS During the swine flu outbreak, uptake rates for protective behaviours and likely acceptance rates for vaccination were low. One reason for this may in part be explained by was the low level of public worry about the possibility of catching swine flu. When levels of worry are generally low, acting to increase the volume of mass media and advertising coverage is likely to increase the perceived efficacy of recommended behaviours, which, in turn, is likely to increase their uptake.","output":"The impact of communications about swine flu (influenza A H1N1v) on public responses to the outbreak: results from 36 national telephone surveys in the UK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing of radiotherapy department in many cancer centers in India has become very challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among parents of children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1764 parents of children with ASD and 4962 parents of typically developing (TD) children were recruited. The participants completed an online survey which contained demographic information, the impact due to COVID-19 crisis, resilience, coping styles, anxiety and depression. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the contributions of these variables to anxiety and depression. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic variables, the following factors were associated with parents anxiety and depression symptoms: (i) Whether or not the participants had a child with ASD; (ii) resilience; (iii) coping strategies, and; (iv) the impact due to COVID-19. Among these, the psychological stress caused by COVID-19 played the most important role in parental anxiety ( = 0.353) and depression ( = 0.242) symptoms. Parents of children with ASD had lower levels of resilience and positive coping, and used more negative coping strategies than parents of TD children.

All-comer patients admitted to the emergency department of Modena University Hospital from 16 March to 31 December 2020 and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia infection were included in the study. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Out of 902 patients, 637 (70.6%) presented a baseline 12-lead ECG registration; of these, 122 (19.2%) were diagnosed with ARs. Atrial fibrillation (AF, 40.2%) was the most frequent AR detected. The primary endpoint (30-day mortality) occurred in 33.6% (p < 0.001). AR-patients presented an almost 3-fold risk of mortality compared to non-AR-patients at 30d (Adj. OR = 2.8, 95%CI: 1.8C4.3, p < 0.001).

RESULTS: A cross-sectional study was employed, where 1145 e-learning enrolled university students were surveyed. The result indicated that nearly 91% of students reported moderate (76.07%) to the higher level (14.85%) of perceived e-learning stress, whereas more than half of them (58.17%) were at the sub-optimum level of readiness.

A sample of 231 Italian participants (56.3% women), with a mean age of 32.7 (SD=12.61), completed an online survey from February to March 2021, during the so called second wave.

RESULTS: Apart from loneliness, women reported lower levels of psychological well-being than men. Fairly good associations between all the detected variables were found. Based on a mediation model evaluation (in which generalized anxiety was introduced as a mediator in the relationship between fear of COVID-19, PTSD, loneliness, social interaction anxiety, and depression), except for social interaction anxiety, total and partial mediation effects suggested that generalized anxiety played a crucial role in exacerbating depressive symptoms during the pandemic.

Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health. METHOD: In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old).

RESULTS: We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p<.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I2=95.22%) indicating substantial variation among studies. CONCLUSIONS: High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship.

Food, eating, and diet were a recurrent focus of discussion at support group meetings throughout the fieldwork period. The ways in which support group participants talked about food centered on 3 distinct but interconnected themes: the prevalence of eating issues as an adverse effect of cancer and its treatment, the importance of eating ability, and questions and concerns connected with the differing and often contradictory cultural models of diet that they were exposed to. Culturally specific understandings of the relationship between food and health informed Chinese patients' experience of eating issues during cancer treatments and their ongoing concern with food and nutrition after the completion of treatment. Health professionals need to pay more attention to the meanings and attributes of food and eating beyond their physiological properties, and further research needs to be conducted with other immigrant populations with culturally distinct understandings of food.","output":"Perceptions of food and eating among Chinese patients with cancer: findings of an ethnographic study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study is intended to analyze the effect of global quality, perceived value, general satisfaction, and emotions on future behavior patterns among participants in the European Duathlon Championship.

Consequently, a relational model was designed to be examined by means of structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Results reveal that global quality and general satisfaction are key dimensions for determining future behaviors of participants, but not so the perceived value. Moreover, up to three combinations of these dimensions together with emotions -pleasure and arousal- emerged as enough for depicting future intentions to a great extent. In this line, a remarkably sufficient combination consists of global quality, general satisfaction, pleasure, and arousal.

Electrochemical platforms can detect the virus via its envelope spike protein by recording changes in voltammetric signals between samples. However, this remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of these sensing platforms. METHODS: Here, we report on a nanobody-functionalized electrochemical platform for the rapid detection of whole SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in complex media such as saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples. The sensor relies on the functionalization of gold electrode surface with highly-oriented Llama nanobodies specific to the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The device provides results in 10 min of exposure to 200 L of unprocessed samples with high specificity to SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in human saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: The developed sensor could discriminate between different human coronavirus strains and other respiratory viruses, with 90% positive and 90% negative percentage agreement on 80 clinical samples, as compared to RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this diagnostic concept, also validated for RBD mutants and successfully tested on Delta variant samples, to be a powerful tool to detect patients infection status, easily extendable to other viruses and capable of overcoming sensing-related mutation effects.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 detection using a nanobody-functionalized voltammetric device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Family Medicine residencies are navigating recruitment in a changing environment.

METHODS: In 2020, we analyzed applicant data and initial residency data for program graduates at a single residency program between 2013 and 2020. This included undergraduate education characteristics, medical school academic performance, medical school academic problems (including professionalism), STEP exams, location of medical school, and assessments during the first 6 months of residency. Of 110 matriculating residents, assessment data was available for 97 (88%). RESULTS: Pre-matriculation USMLE data had a positive correlation with initial American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) in-training exams.

These disparities have been explored in existing biometrics systems such as facial biometrics (identifying individuals based on facial attributes). However, such ethical issues remain largely unexplored in voice biometric systems that are very popular and extensively used globally. Using a corpus of non-speech voice records featuring a diverse group of 300 speakers by race (75 each from White, Black, Asian, and Latinx subgroups) and gender (150 each from female and male subgroups), we explore and reveal that racial subgroup has a similar voice characteristic and gender subgroup has a significant different voice characteristic. Moreover, non-negligible racial and gender disparities exist in speaker identification accuracy by analyzing the performance of one commercial product and five research products. The average accuracy for Latinxs can be 12% lower than Whites (p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.58%, 14.15%) and can be significantly higher for female speakers than males (3.67% higher, p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.23%, 11.57%). We further discover that racial disparities primarily result from the neural network-based feature extraction within the voice biometric product and gender disparities primarily due to both voice inherent characteristic difference and neural network-based feature extraction.

Here, we present a detailed echocardiographic and clinical timeline with 1-year follow-up. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old female with COVID-19 went into shock from a massive pulmonary embolism. After percutaneous removal of a large thrombus burden (AngioVac system; AngioDynamics Inc., Latham, NY, USA), she became severely hypotensive, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and hemodynamic support with an Impella RP device (Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA). A paediatric transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) probe monitored the procedure because an adult probe would not pass (S7-3tPhilips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA). Post-thrombectomy, surface imaging documented gradual resolution of RV dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Her course was complicated by renal failure requiring temporary dialysis. She was discharged home on apixaban. Hypercoagulability work-up was negative. Two months later, vocal cord surgery was performed for persistent stridor. Esophagoscopy at that time was prevented by osteophyte obstruction. At 10 months, she received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. At 1 year, the patient remains healthy on apixaban, and her echocardiogram is normal. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the pivotal role of echocardiography in the diagnosis, percutaneous treatment, and near- and long-term follow-up and management of a patient with massive pulmonary embolism due to COVID-19 with documentation of complete recovery from severe RV dysfunction and haemodynamic collapse.

METHODS: As part of a larger study aimed at investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, serology, and perception on a college campus, participants were asked about their views on the COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021. Vaccination status was assessed by self-report in April 2021. Logistic regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios with marginal standardization. RESULTS: We found that non-White participants were 25% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccination compared to White participants. Among those who were unvaccinated, Black and other non-White participants were significantly more likely to indicate they were unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine compared to White participants. The most common reason for unwillingness to receive the vaccine was belief that the vaccine approval process was rushed.

Methods and Materials: We reviewed the fractionation schemes for all patients in our department, including those receiving treatment and those soon to start treatment. Our goals were to (1) decrease the number of patients coming daily to the hospital for RT, (2) adapt our human resources to continue patients care in the department, and (3) help to cover understaffed COVID-19 sectors of the hospital. Results: We identified 50 patients who were receiving treatment (n = 6), were going to start radiation after CT scan simulation (n = 41), or for whom the CT scan was pending (n = 3). The majority were women (64%) treated for breast cancer (54%). RT was delayed for 22 (44%) patients. The majority were offered hormone therapy as waiting therapy.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study with follow up at three months post enrollment was done. Children with unknown HIV status were tested for HIV infection as per 2012 Tanzanian algorithm. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic, clinical and follow up information. Data was statistically analyzed in STATA v13. RESULTS: A total of 525 children were enrolled in the study. Median [IQR] age was 28 [15C54] months. Males consisted of 60.2% of all the participants. HIV prevalence was 9.3% (49/525). Thirty-three (67.3%) of HIV-infected children were newly diagnosed at enrolment. Thirty-nine (79.6%) of all HIV-infected patients had WHO HIV/AIDS clinical stage four disease, 10 (20.4%) had WHO clinical stage three and none qualified in stage one or two. About 84% (41/49) of HIV infected children had severe immunodeficiency at the time of the study.

In view of the difficulties to solve the system exactly, we propose a computational model to approximate its solutions following a nonstandard approach. Results: The nonstandard discretization is fully analyzed for positivity, boundedness and stability. It is worth pointing out that these properties are realized in the discrete scenario and that they are thoroughly established herein using rigorous mathematical arguments. We provide some illustrative computational simulations to exhibit the main computational features of this approach. Conclusions: The results show that the nonstandard technique is capable of preserving the distinctive characteristics of the epidemiologically relevant solutions of the model, while other (classical) approaches are not able to do it. For the sake of convenience, a computational code of the nonstandard discrete model may be provided to the readers at their requests.","output":"Analysis of a nonstandard computer method to simulate a nonlinear stochastic epidemiological model of coronavirus-like diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the radiological features, diagnostic accuracy and features of imaging studies and their relation with clinical course of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in pregnant women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical, laboratory and radiological features of symptomatic pregnant women suspected of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Chest radiography (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-five of eighty-one pregnant women were included in the final analysis. The most common admission symptoms were dry cough (45.4%), fever (29.1%) and dyspnea (34.5%). Radiological imaging studies were performed in 34 (61.8%) patients. Fourteen (66.7%) of the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients had parenchymal abnormalities on CXR, and most common abnormalities were airspace opacities (61.9%) and prominent bronchovascular shadows (28.6%). Seventeen (85.0%) of the patients had parenchymal abnormalities consistent with COVID-19 on their chest CT. Chest CT most commonly showed bilateral (88.2%), multilobe (100%) involvement; peripheral and central distribution (70.6%); patchy-shape (94.1%) and ground-glass opacity (94.1%). The sensitivity of CXR and chest CT was calculated as 66.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Preterm birth rate was 41.2% (n=7/17). Five (9.1%) of the 55 pregnant women admitted to the intensive care unit, three of those developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and one died. CONCLUSION: This study describes the main radiological features of symptomatic pregnant women infected with COVID-19. The refusal rate among pregnant women for the imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation was high but these had high sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis. The preterm birth and cesarean section rates were observed as remarkably increased.","output":"Clinical and radiologic characteristics of symptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En este artculo analizamos el escenario sanitario de la epidemia de COVID-19 en Amrica Latina y profundizamos en algunos aspectos relevantes del escenario poltico, econmico y social que caracteriza a la regin en los momentos en que est transcurriendo esta pandemia.

Detection by RT-PCR as the gold standard of WHO is still difficult to reach in some areas and has a low sensitivity issue. Many studies have focused on the detection of Covid-19 using computer vision, especially deep learning methods. However, it is necessary to evaluate the preprocessing stage before carrying out the classification to increase the accuracy of its detection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the choice of the CT-Scan image pre-processing method and its effect on the results of covid-19 classification accuracy. The benefit of this study is that it can be used as a recommendation when considering the choice of a CT-Scan image preprocessing method to improve the accuracy of Covid-19 detection through more comprehensive deep learning. This study uses a CT scan image because it is considered to be of better quality than an X-ray image, although the price is relatively more expensive. The various methods used were resizing (deformed and non-deformed), enhancement(HE, CLAHE, EFF), and normalization ranges ([-1 1] and [0 1]). Meanwhile, the deep learning method used is the VGG-16 classifier. The results showed that there was an influence generated by the variations in the preprocessing methods on the precision of the Covid-19 classification. The highest accuracy results were obtained with 88.54% using the deformation ranges of size change, CLAHE improvement and normalization [0 1] and [-1 1].

This study aimed to project the percentage of adults with longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions following COVID-19 associated with the economic consequences. METHODS: We retrieved historical data on the unemployment rates and status of longstanding illnesses among adults from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and National Survey for Wales (NSW), and used time-series models to project the unemployment rates and percentage of adults with longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions over a three year period (2020/21 - 2022/23). RESULTS: Without reparative interventions, the unemployment rate is expected to increase sharply from 3.8% in 2019 to about 7% in 2020 following COVID-19 and then gradually increase over the projected period. With increased unemployment, longstanding illness (LSI) would be expected to increase gradually following COVID-19, with an estimated increase of around or exceeding 4% over three years depending on the LSI measure. There would be a higher increment in the percentage of adults with limiting LSI compared with adults with any LSI, suggesting implications for wider health and social care services. With current unemployment predictions, the percentage of adults with chronic health conditions is projected to increase following the COVID-19 pandemic over the projected period, with a higher increment for mental health and endocrine/metabolic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions are expected to increase in the coming years following COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, preventative measures for longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions should be a priority for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19.

AIM: To understand the pandemic's impact on recently-arrived migrants and their access to primary health care, and implications for vaccine roll-out. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with primary care professionals (PCPs) and migrants in urban, suburban, and rural settings across England. METHOD: Sixty-four PCPs and administrative staff, and 17 recently-arrived migrants were recruited using purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: PCPs and migrants concurred that digitalisation and virtual consultations have amplified existing inequalities in access to health care for many migrants, due to a lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. PCPs were concerned that virtual consultations resulted in difficulties building trust and risked missing safeguarding cues. Both PCPs and migrants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing health care due to physical closure of surgeries, as well as indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and a lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. Migrants reported a range of specific beliefs, from acceptance to mistrust, around COVID-19 and potential COVID-19 vaccines, often influenced by misinformation. Innovative opportunities were suggested, including translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube; these merit further exploration. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related changes to primary care delivery may become permanent; some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services.

Its treatment is challenging due to product failures resulting from rapidly emerging resistance to existing treatments, incorrect treatment applications and misdiagnosis. Various head lice treatments with different mechanism of action have been developed and explored over the years, with limited report on systematic assessments of their efficacy and safety. This work aims to present a robust evidence summarising the interventions used in head lice. Method This is a systematic review and network meta-analysis which will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement for network meta-analyses. Selected databases, including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials exploring head lice treatments. Searches will be limited to trials published in English from database inception till 2021. Grey literature will be identified through Open Grey, AHRQ, Grey Literature Report, Grey Matters, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry. Additional studies will be sought from reference lists of included studies. Study screening, selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality will be undertaken by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved via a third reviewer. The primary outcome measure is the relative risk of cure at 7 and 14 days postinitial treatment. Secondary outcome measures may include adverse drug events, ovicidal activity, treatment compliance and acceptability, and reinfestation. Information from direct and indirect evidence will be used to generate the effect sizes (relative risk) to compare the efficacy and safety of individual head lice treatments against a common comparator (placebo and/or permethrin). Risk of bias assessment will be undertaken by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the certainty of evidence assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations guideline for network meta-analysis. All quantitative analyses will be conducted using STATA V.16.

Most commonly, host-associated bacteria interfere with host gene expression to modulate the immune response to the infection. However, many of these bacteria also interfere with host cellular differentiation pathways to create a hospitable niche, resulting in the formation of novel cell types, tissues, and organs. In both of these situations, bacterial symbionts must interact with eukaryotic regulatory pathways. Here, we detail what is known about how bacterial symbionts, from pathogens to mutualists, control host cellular differentiation across the central dogma, from epigenetic chromatin modifications, to transcription and mRNA processing, to translation and protein modifications. We identify four main trends from this survey. First, mechanisms for controlling host gene expression appear to evolve from symbionts co-opting cross-talk between host signaling pathways. Second, symbiont regulatory capacity is constrained by the processes that drive reductive genome evolution in host-associated bacteria. Third, the regulatory mechanisms symbionts exhibit correlate with the cost/benefit nature of the association. And, fourth, symbiont mechanisms for interacting with host genetic regulatory elements are not bound by native bacterial capabilities. Using this knowledge, we explore how the ubiquitous intracellular Wolbachia symbiont of arthropods and nematodes may modulate host cellular differentiation to manipulate host reproduction. Our survey of the literature on how infection alters gene expression in Wolbachia and its hosts revealed that, despite their intermediate-sized genomes, different strains appear capable of a wide diversity of regulatory manipulations. Given this and Wolbachia's diversity of phenotypes and eukaryotic-like proteins, we expect that many symbiont-induced host differentiation mechanisms will be discovered in this system.","output":"Trends in Symbiont-Induced Host Cellular Differentiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa influenced how public health officials considered migration and emerging infectious diseases.

The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in the management of haemorrhoids in Italy over the last 17 years. METHOD An electronic database which recorded details of management relating to the severity of haemorrhoids between 2000 and 2016 was obtained from 18 of 34 colorectal surgeons who were invited to participate. RESULTS A total of 32 458 patients were treated for haemorrhoids by 18 expert coloproctologists during a 17-year period. Patients were classified as Grade II (7542, 23.2%), Grade III(15 360, 47.3%) and Grade IV (9556, 29.4%). Grade II haemorrhoids were treated with rubber band ligation in over 90% of the cases, and patients with Grade IV had a Milligan-Morgan (MM) haemorrhoidectomy in over 90% of the cases. In Grade III, the use of stapled haemorrhoidopexy progressively decreased from 30% to 35% (between 2000 and 2007) to 5% of the cases. Meanwhile, commencing from 2006 the use of Doppler-guided haemorrhoid artery ligation (DGHAL) with mucopexy increased progressively from 6% to 24%. Over the years, the percentage of MM haemorrhoidectomy remained consistent at between 65% and 70% of the cases. CONCLUSION Relevant changes in the surgical choice of haemorrhoid treatment have occurred in Italy over the last 17 years. MM haemorrhoidectomy remains the most frequently performed procedure for Grade III haemorrhoids. Stapled haemorrhoidopexy has become much less popular in contrast to DGHAL with mucopexy which is being performed much more frequently.","output":"Surgical management of haemorrhoids: an Italian survey of over 32 000 patients over 17 years."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diterpene compounds specially macrocyclic ones comprising jatrophane, lathyrane, terracinolide, ingenane, pepluane, paraliane, and segetane skeletons occurring in plants of the Euphorbiaceae family are of considerable interest in the context of natural product drug discovery programs.

This leads to issues relating to symptom control and quality of care. As part of an international project focused on bereaved relatives perceptions about quality of end-of-life care, we undertook a quality improvement (QI) project in a general hospital in Crdoba city, Argentina. By using two iterative QI cycles, we launched an educational process and introduced a clinical mnemonic tool, I-PASS, during ward handovers. The introduction of the handover tool was intended to improve out-of-hours care. Our clinical outcome measure was ensuring comfort in at least 60% of dying patients, as perceived by family carers, during night shifts in an oncology ward during the project period (MarchCMay 2019). As process-based measures, we selected the proportion of staff completing the I-PASS course (target 60%) and using I-PASS in at least 60% of handovers. Participatory action research was the chosen method. During the study period, 13/16 dying patients were included. We received 23 reports from family carers about the level of patient comfort during the previous night. Sixty-five per cent of healthcare professionals completed the I-PASS training. The percentage of completed handovers increased from 60% in the first Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle to 68% in the second one. The proportion of positive reports about patient comfort increased from 63% (end of the first PDSA cycle) to 87% (last iterative analysis after 3 months). Moreover, positive responses to Did doctors and nurses do enough for the patient to be comfortable during the night? increased from 75% to 100% between the first and the second QI cycle. In conclusion, we achieved the successful introduction and staff training for use of the I-PASS tool.

It presents a number of challenges to the primary care physician and particularly if the clinical examination and routine investigations are normal. However, while fatigue is a feature of many common illnesses, it is the main problem in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). This is a poorly understood condition that is accompanied by several additional symptoms which suggest a subtle multisystem dysfunction. Not infrequently it is complicated by sleep disturbance and alterations in attention, memory and mood.Specialised services for the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME are markedly deficient in the UK and indeed in virtually all countries around the world.

The latter include those that assess inflammation, autoimmunity, endocrine dysfunction and gluten sensitivity. Early diagnosis and intervention in general practice will do much to reduce patient anxiety, encourage improvement and prevent expensive unnecessary investigations.There is presently an on-going debate as to the precise criteria that best confirms CFS/ME to the exclusion of other medical and psychiatric/psychological causes of chronic fatigue. There is also some disagreement as to best means of investigating and managing this very challenging condition.

Bluetongue in cattle is associated with vesicular lesions, weight loss, low milk production, and low reproductive capacity. It should not be ignored as it is associated with large economic losses to the livestock breeding industry in China. Although many studies have investigated bluetongue virus infection in cattle, no nationwide study on the prevalence of bluetongue virus infection in cattle from China has yet been conducted. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for bluetongue in cattle. Results: We collected 50 publications from 1988 to 2019 through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database. A total of the pooled bluetongue seroprevalence of 12.2% (5,332/87,472) in cattle was tested. The point estimate of bluetongue collected from 2001 to 2011 was 22.5% (95% CI: 1.2C58.9), which was higher than after 2012 (9.9%, 95% CI: 3.3C19.4). The analysis of the feeding model subgroup revealed that the seroprevalence of bluetongue was significantly higher (P < 0.05) among free-range cattle (22.5%; 95% CI: 7.7C42.3) than among cattle from intensive farming systems (1.8%; 95% CI: 0.0C6.7). The seroprevalence of bluetongue in different species showed significant variation (P < 0.05), with the highest seroprevalence of 39.8% (95% CI: 18.7C63.0) in buffalo and the lowest seroprevalence of 4.3% (95% CI: 1.2C9.0) in yak. In the zoogeographical division subgroup, the seroprevalence of bluetongue correlated positively within a certain range with the species distribution of Culicoides. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that bluetongue was prevalent in cattle in China. In addition, the contact with sheep, other ruminants, or transmission media such as Culicoides may increase the seroprevalence of bluetongue disease in cattle.

This paper proposes a general framework named ViPal for virulence prediction that incorporates discrete prior viral mutation and reassortment information based on all eight influenza segments. The posterior regularization technique is leveraged to transform prior viral knowledge to constraint features and integrated into the machine learning models. Experimental results on influenza genomic datasets validate that our proposed framework can improve virulence prediction performance over baselines. The comparison between ViPal and other existing methods shows the computational efficiency of our framework with superior performance.

Dedicated immune cell models, mimicking PMM2-CDG, could circumvent many of these problems and facilitate research into the mechanisms of immune dysfunction. Here we provide initial observations about the immunophenotype and the phagocytic function of primary PMM2-CDG monocytes. Furthermore, we assessed the suitability of two different glycosylation-impaired human monocyte models: tunicamycin-treated THP-1 monocytes and PMM2 knockdown THP-1 monocytes induced by shRNAs. We found no significant differences in primary monocyte subpopulations of PMM2-CDG patients as compared to healthy individuals but we did observe anomalous surface glycosylation patterns in PMM2-CDG patient monocytes as determined using fluorescent lectin binding. We also looked at the capacity of monocytes to bind and internalize fungal particles and found a slightly increased uptake of C. albicans by PMM2-CDG monocytes as compared to healthy monocytes. Tunicamycin-treated THP-1 monocytes showed a highly decreased uptake of fungal particles, accompanied by a strong decrease in glycosylation levels and a high induction of ER stress. In contrast and despite a drastic reduction of the PMM2 enzyme activity, PMM2 knockdown THP-1 monocytes showed no changes in global surface glycosylation levels, levels of fungal particle uptake similar to control monocytes, and no ER stress induction. Collectively, these initial observations suggest that the absence of ER stress in PMM2 knockdown THP-1 cells make this model superior over tunicamycin-treated THP-1 cells and more comparable to primary PMM2-CDG monocytes. Further development and exploitation of CDG monocyte models will be essential for future in-depth studies to ultimately unravel the mechanisms of immune dysfunction in CDG.","output":"Evaluation of Cell Models to Study Monocyte Functions in PMM2 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

We tested eVITTA on transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected human nasopharyngeal swab samples, and identified a downregulation of olfactory signal transducers, in line with the clinical presentation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. We also analyzed transcriptomes of Caenorhabditis elegans worms with disrupted S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, confirming activation of innate immune responses and feedback induction of one-carbon cycle genes.

Measuring heterogeneity is challenging, especially for naked-eye invisible viruses, but of obvious importance. For example, spatial heterogeneity of virus distribution may strongly influence infection spreading and outbreaks in the case of pathogenic viruses; the spatial distribution (i.e., the inter-subject heterogeneity) of commensal viruses within/on our bodies can influence the competition, coexistence, and dispersal of viruses within or between our bodies. Taylors power law (TPL) was first discovered in the 1960s to describe the spatial distributions of plant and/or animal populations, and since then it has been verified by numerous experimental and theoretical studies. Recently, TPL has been extended from population to community level and applied to bacterial communities. Here we report the first comprehensive testing of the TPL fitted to human virome datasets. It was found that the human virome follows the TPL as bacterial communities do. Furthermore, the TPL heterogeneity scaling parameter of human virome is virtually the same as that of the human bacterial microbiome (1.916 vs. 1.926). We postulate that the extreme closeness of human viruses and bacteria in heterogeneity scaling coefficients could be attributed to the fact that most of the viruses that were annotated in this study actually belong to bacteriophages (86% viral OTUs) that piggyback on their bacterial hosts, and their distributions are likely host-dependent. The scaling parameter, which measures the inter-subject heterogeneity changes, should be an innate property of human microbiomes including both bacteria and viruses. It is similar to the acceleration coefficient of the gravity (g = 9.8) as specified by Newtons law, which is invariant on the earth. Nevertheless, we caution that our postulation is contingent on an implicit assumption that the proportion of bacteriophages to total virome may not change significantly when more virus species can be identified in future.","output":"Spatial heterogeneity analysis of the human virome with Taylors power law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dempster-Shafer theory is widely applied to uncertainty modelling and knowledge reasoning due to its ability of expressing uncertain information.

Given that the number of vaccinations will continue to dramatically increase in the following months, urologists should be aware of potential genitourinary side effects of the vaccine. In this study, we investigated the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to quantify and describe reported urologic symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. METHODS: The FDA VAERS is an early warning system that can detect potential issues with licensed vaccines. We queried the VAERS for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that have been processed as of February 12th, 2021. The list of unique symptoms was then reviewed separately by two physicians and all urology-specific symptoms were isolated and the associated adverse events were reviewed. Patient demographics and adverse event description free text were reviewed and compiled. RESULTS: Our query generated a list of 15,785 adverse event reports with 73,867 symptoms. Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described a urologic symptom. Urologic complaints made up 0.2% (156/73,867) of all the symptoms reported following vaccination. The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96). 54% of the reports were about female patients. We categorized the urologic symptoms into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n=34, 22%), Hematuria (n=22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n=41, 26%), Skin/Soft Tissue (n=16, 10%), and Other (n=43, 28%). CONCLUSIONS: These results can provide reassurance and help counsel providers and patients, especially as vaccination efforts continue to grow. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate urologic symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination as these details were not reported from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trial results.

Hence, ACE has long been used as a universal target to identify antihypertensive peptides. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a homolog of ACE but uses Ang II as its key substrate to produce angiotensin (1-7), exerting vasodilatory activity via the mas receptor (MasR).

However, there is still no consensus on which of these methods is superior to the other. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was designed to answer to the question whether CT scan can be used in diagnosis of COVID-19 or not. METHODS: Searches were performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until the end of April 2020. Two researchers gathered the data of diagnostic accuracy studies that had attempted to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of CT scan in diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Data of 9 studies were included. Area under the curve of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, pleural effusion, other CT features, and simultaneous observation of GGO with other CT features was 0.64 (95% CI 0.60C0.69), 0.30 (95% CI 0.26C0.34), 0.60 (95% CI 0.56C0.64), 0.61 (95% CI 0.56C0.65), and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87C0.92), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of simultaneous observation of GGO with other CT scan features was higher than all of the other signs. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of this sign was calculated to be 0.90, 0.89, and 20, respectively. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous observation of GGO and other features of viral pneumonia in CT scan had optimum performance in detection of COVID-19.

Although many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions, there were few reasonable explanations for the practical geographic significance of the model parameters. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of different interventions to mitigate the spread of the epidemic, including discussion about the different time and intensity of implementation, and map parameters of model to the practical application meanings of the special interventions. Methods: : In this study, a COVID-19 spread model based on the discrete grid was proposed from perspective of geography. A multi-level grid was introduced to describe the quarantine status and intensity in different spaces, which also combined with the model of medical reception-cured and self-protection, and the spatiotemporal evolution process of early COVID-19 spread was simulated based on the spatial correlation, finally, the effect of interventions was quantitatively analyzed by the dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. Results: : Quarantine measure were the most effective interventions, which could effectively reduce the peak value of infection, advance the arrival time of the peak, and shorten the duration of the epidemic, but it only played a role under sufficient intensity;the medical reception-cured and self-protection measure could effectively fatten the infection curve and slowed the spread of the epidemic in the early stage, which could provide more buffer time for the relevant government departments, but the practical effect was not obvious because of the limitation of actually invested resources. The role of the medical reception-cured measure was more reflected in the reduction of the number of deaths, and the effect of the self-protection measure could be reduced in strict quarantine measure. Conclusions: : Results of the study indicated that the quarantine, medical reception-cured and self-protection measures were effective, and mitigating the spread of COVID-19 by achieving strong interventions was necessary.

The ten most recent citations for the most-cited article on each index intervention were examined on whether they were critical to the highly-cited study. Altmetric scores were also obtained. Findings. 40 articles of clinical studies on these index interventions had received >150 citations (7 exceeded 1,000 citations). 20/40 (50%) had favorable conclusions and 4 were equivocal. Highly-cited articles with favorable conclusions were rarely RCTs while those without favorable conclusions were mostly RCTs (3/20 vs 15/20, p=0.0003).

METHODOLOGY: A systematic collection was carried out on the effects of that COVID-19 can cause directly and/or indirectly to pregnancy and the placenta in the following databases: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs and Web of Science. For search, the following descriptors were used: placenta, pregnant woman, COVID-19, maternal-fetal. RESULTS: The results indicate transplacental transmission in some cases reviewed in many reports from this study. The presence of the virus was seen in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and peripheral blood.

For the treatment of COVID-19, selective lung-localizing strategies hold tremendous potential, as SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung via ACE2 receptors and causes severe pneumonia. Similarly, recent reports have shown the association of COVID-19 with decreased 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and increased cytokine levels. This mechanism, which involves the activation of inflammatory NF-B- and SREBP2-mediated inflammasome signaling pathways, is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. To resolve those clinical conditions observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, we report 25-HC and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) nanovesicles (25-HC@DDAB) as a COVID-19 drug candidate for the restoration of intracellular cholesterol level and suppression of cytokine storm. Our data demonstrate that 25-HC@DDAB can selectively accumulate the lung tissues and effectively downregulate NF-B and SREBP2 signaling pathways in COVID-19 patient-derived PBMCs, reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. Altogether, our findings suggest that 25-HC@DDAB is a promising candidate for the treatment of symptoms associated with severe COVID-19 patients, such as decreased cholesterol level and cytokine storm.","output":"Lung-selective 25-hydroxycholesterol nanotherapeutics as a suppressor of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The profile of public health professionals (PHPs) and COVID\\\\19 preparedness is assessed against the employment outcomes (EO), precarious employment (PE), and job satisfaction (JS) of the European Public Health Master programme alumni.

METHODS: 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. RESULTS: Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission.

First, we find that the primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp high-mass cut-off; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break at $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\\\\,M_\\\\odot$, or a power law with a Gaussian feature peaking at $33.1^{+4.0}_{-5.6}\\\\,M_\\\\odot$ (90\\\\% credible interval).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes on primary HIV-1 infection progression in an acute HIV-1-infected cohort in Beijing (PRIMO), China. DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes of 178 acute HIV-1-infected patients and 196 HIV-negative candidates from the PRIMO cohort. HIV-1 viral load and CD4(+) T-cell counts were monitored at multiple time points during the first year of infection, and the association between IFITM3-rs12252 genotype and disease progression was evaluated. RESULTS: The current study shows that the IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variant affects the progression of HIV-1 infection, but not the acquisition. A significantly higher frequency of the CC/CT genotypes was found in rapid progressors compared to nonprogressors. Patients with CC/CT genotypes showed an elevated peak viremia level and significantly lower CD4(+) T-cell count at multiple time points during the first year of primary infection, and a significantly higher risk of rapid decline of the CD4(+) T-cell count to below 350 cells/l.

This paper will be exploring the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology in individuals with diabetes and insulin resistance making them more prone to have worse outcomes after SARS- CoV2 infection, and to propose an adjunctive therapy to help combat the cytokine surge seen in COVID-19. It will also look at the immunomodulatory effects of glutathione, an antioxidant shown to reduce immune dysregulation in other diseases; Vitamin D, which has been shown to prevent COVID-19 patients from requiring more intensive care time possibly due to its ability to decrease the expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines; and steroids, which have been used as immune modulators despite their ability to exacerbate hyperglycemia.","output":"Type 2 Diabetes Contributes to Altered Adaptive Immune Responses and Vascular Inflammation in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We survey over 1,000 institutional and corporate venture capitalists (VCs) at more than 900 different firms to learn how their decisions and investments have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scientific arena has been kept animated via continuous investigations in an effort to understand the spread dynamics and the impact of various mitigation measures to keep this pandemic diminished. Despite a lot of research works having been accomplished this far, the pandemic is still deep-rooted in many regions worldwide signaling for more scientific investigations. This study joins the field by developing a modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) compartmental deterministic model whose key distinct feature is the incorporation of the COVID Alert SA app use by the general public in prolific intention to control the spread of the epidemic. Validation of the model is performed by fitting the model to the Republic of South Africa's COVID-19 cases reported data using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm implemented in fitR package. The model's sensitivity analysis and simulations stipulate that gradual to complete use of the app would be perfect in contact tracing and substantially reduce the plateau number of COVID-19 infections. This would consequentially contribute remarkably to the eradication of the SARS-CoV-2 over time. Proportional amalgamation of the app use and test for COVID-19 on individuals not using the app would also reduce the peak number of infections apart from the 50 C 50% ratio which spikes the plateau number beyond any other proportion.

Many studies have shown that depression and anxiety are the main problems faced by medical students. To assess the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students worldwide, we conducted this meta-analysis. METHODS: According to PRISMA, we used a computerized strategy to search studies in EMBASE, PubMed, PsycArticles, Web of Science, and China Biology Medicine disc. The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was calculated by a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analysis. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also carried out in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of 1316 studies, 41 studies were selected based on 36608 medical students. The pooled depression prevalence was 37.9% (95% CI: 30.7C45.4%), and pooled anxiety prevalence was 33.7% (95% CI: 26.8C41.1%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students varied by gender, country, and continent. CONCLUSION: The data reported that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students during COVID-19 was relatively higher than those of the general population and the healthcare workers.

Rapid, accurate identification of poorly performing hospitals is critical for avoiding potentially preventable mortality and represents an opportunity to enhance QI efforts. METHODS Hospital-level analysis using Veterans Affairs (VA) Surgical Quality Improvement Program data (2011-2016) to compare identification of hospitals with excess, risk-adjusted 30-day mortality using observed-to-expected (O-E) ratios (ie, current gold standard) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) with V-mask. Various V-mask slopes and radii were evaluated-slope of 2.5 and radius of 1.0 was used as the base case. RESULTS Hospitals identified by CUSUM and quarterly O-E were identified midway into a quarter [median 47 days; interquartile range (IQR): 24-61 days before quarter end] translating to a median of 129 (IQR: 60-187) surgical cases and 368 (IQR: 145-681) postoperative inpatient days occurring after a CUSUM signal, but before the quarter end. At hospitals identified by CUSUM but not O-E, a median of 2 deaths within a median of 5 days triggered a signal. In some cases, these clusters extended beyond CUSUM identification date with as many as 8 deaths undetected using O-E. Sensitivity and negative predictive values for CUSUM relative to O-E were 71.9% (95% confidence interval: 66.2%-77.1%) and 95.5% (94.4%-96.4%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS CUSUM evaluation identifies hospitals with clusters of mortality in excess of expected more rapidly than periodic analysis.

Early real-world data of a new percutaneous direct annuloplasty system for tricuspid repair were examined. METHODS The first 60 patients treated with the Cardioband tricuspid valve repair system at 4 centers were included in this retrospective study. The primary efficacy end point was technical success with reduction of TR 2 grades at discharge. Combined primary safety end point was major adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, cardiothoracic surgery, and stroke) at 30 days. RESULTS Median patient age was 76 years (73-82), median EuroScore II was 3.9% (2.2-8.1), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was present in 78%, and 81.7% were in the New York Heart Association class III/IV. Massive or torrential TR was found in 51.7%, and severe TR in 48.3%. The primary efficacy end point was achieved in 45%, while 60.3% of patients had less-than-severe TR at discharge. Vena contracta was reduced by 47% from 12.94.8 to 7.03.4 mm (P<0.001). Overall, the majority of patients (81.7%) improved at least by 1 New York Heart Association class.

All procedures were performed using a hybrid transvaginal technique, including an umbilical small-size trocar. End points, calculated at discharge, 30 and up to 90 days postoperatively, included intra- and postoperative morbidity assessed by the validated Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Special focus was held on outcome and necessity of pre- and postoperative gynecological examinations. Results. We performed 571 hybrid NOTES cholecystectomies within 9 years. The vast majority were elective, 9.6% were emergency cholecystectomies. 6.7% of patients developed at least one complication until discharge, most of them minor (grade II). 30- and 90-day complication rates were 10.7% and 11%, respectively. Mean CCI at discharge and postoperative days 30 and 90 was 1.45 (6.4), 2.3 (7.7), and 2.4 (7.8), respectively.

This study proposes the bank risk scenario after the credit restructuring policy of the OJK moratorium in March 2022 and proposes the internal bank policy simulation to mitigate credit and capital risks in terms of Non-Performing Loan (NPL) and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR). The difficulty of this study is how to develop the risk scenario and to simulate the bank risk mitigation policy after the policy moratorium, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and the economy is not yet normal. To that purpose, this study uses a system dynamics methodology with Powersim Studio 10? software that is able to make scenarios on the level of credit risk (NPL) and bank capital (CAR) and able to simulate internal bank policy to overcome the risk by considering the environmental and policy changes. Based on the policy simulation, it is recommended that bank can implement the restructuring policy to control the credit risk and strengthening the NPL monitoring activity in order to manage and decrease the loan impairment expenses. To increase CAR, the result shows that the combined policy consists of the NPL monitoring program, the interest rate and the operating cost management program is able to produce a significant increase in banks capital (CAR).

This analysis quantifies the human resource released when moving away from traditional mixing of drug concentrate at the bedside. Methods: A model was constructed to simulate noradrenaline delivery for people experiencing critical hypotension requiring vasopressor support in the intensive care setting. It simulated resource consumption over 24 hours taking account of noradrenaline dose and flow rate, product size, ampoule pooling for dilution, preparation volume, sterility changes, pumping methods, and drug wastage. The duration, location and skill requirement of human-resourced tasks were also included and costed. Outcomes were applied to a hypothetical English population over one year (2019). Results: Based on 4,123 critical care beds giving 231,011 days of vasopressor support annually, and a move from syringe-based double pumping to volumetric pumping in 80% of units (20% estimated to deliver volumetrically already), a comprehensive switch to the ready-to-administer formulation released 33,927 days (167.1 WTEs) of nursing time from non-patient facing activity. A resource equivalent to 11.0m at 50/50 band 5/6. There were fewer episodes of preparation needed, no ampoule cracking or pooling for dilution, and no injection into infusion bags and changing with ensuing sterility risk.

The equilibrium points of the new system are found for both diffusive and non-diffusive models, where a detailed stability analysis is conducted for them. Moreover, the stability regions in the space of parameters are attained for each equilibrium point for both cases of the model and the effects of parameters are explored. A numerical verification for the proposed model using a finite difference-based method is illustrated along with their consistency, stability and proving the positivity of the acquired solutions.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between social vulnerability and the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths (per 100,000) in 3,141 United States counties. METHODS: The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths was obtained from USA Facts. Variables related to social vulnerability were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey. Data were analyzed using spatial autoregression models. RESULTS: Lowest income and educational level, as well as high proportions of single parent households, mobile home residents, and people without health insurance were positively associated with a high cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are regional differences in the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths in United States counties, which are affected by various social vulnerabilities. Hence, these findings underscore the need to take social vulnerability into account when planning interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths.","output":"A spatial analysis of the association between social vulnerability and the cumulative number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in United States counties through November 14, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy plays significant roles in replication and pathogenesis of many animal viruses. However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFV-infected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF.","output":"Classical Swine Fever Virus Infection Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagy to Sustain Viral Replication in vivo and in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-disclosure on social networking sites (SNSs) leads to social capital development, connectedness, and relationship building.

METHODS: This observational study captured clinical and sociodemographic characteristics for children ( 21 years) receiving cancer therapy and infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the pandemic onset through February 19, 2021. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort were compared with population-level pediatric oncology data (SEER). Multivariable binomial regression models evaluated patient characteristics associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and changes in cancer therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-four institutions contributed details on 917 children with cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Median age at SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11 years (range, 0-21 years). Compared with SEER, there was an over-representation of Hispanics (43.6% v 29.7%, P < .01), publicly insured (59.3% v 33.5%, P < .01), and patients with hematologic malignancies (65.8% v 38.3%, P < .01) in our cohort. The majority (64.1%) were symptomatic; 31.2% were hospitalized, 10.9% required respiratory support, 9.2% were admitted to the ICU, and 1.6% died because of SARS-CoV-2. Cancer therapy was modified in 44.9%. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with changes in cancer-directed therapy (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6]). Presence of comorbidities was associated with hospitalization (aRR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) and ICU admission (aRR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.6). Hematologic malignancies were associated with hospitalization (aRR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.1). CONCLUSION: These findings provide critical information for decision making among pediatric oncologists, including inpatient versus outpatient management, cancer therapy modifications, consideration of monoclonal antibody therapy, and counseling families on infection risks in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The over-representation of Hispanic and publicly insured patients in this national cohort suggests disparities that require attention.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Childhood Cancer in 2020: A Disease of Disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is ongoing globally. Limited data are available for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: A retrospective case study was conducted in one designated hospital for children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. Results: Out of the 74 children with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median age was 5.8 years, with no notable variation based on gender. All of the children had had direct exposure to at least one family member with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms were cough in 41 (55.4%) and fever in 38 (51.4%). Typical CT patterns of viral pneumonia were exhibited in 40 (54.1%) children, including ground-glass opacity and interstitial abnormalities. However, 17 (23.0%) children were classified as asymptomatic carriers, with neither symptoms nor radiological findings. Also, 68 (91.9%) children recovered fully and showed negative results on RT-PCR assay by nasopharyngeal swabs during our observation period. In contrast to the negative result for nasopharyngeal swab, 34% of the anal swabs showed a continued positive result. The mean hospitalization days of the children discharged after full recovery was 10.0 days. Conclusion: Within family clusters that had SARS-CoV-2 infection, children had mild or even asymptomatic illness. Although CT is highly sensitive, it should be avoided in follow-up of the disease in consideration of the radiological hazards and limited clinical benefits for mild illness in children. Furthermore, it is advocated that both nasopharyngeal and anal swabs should be confirmed negative for viral load prior to declaring full recovery so as to avoid oral-fecal transmission. Asymptomatic children with family clusters are potentially a little-known source of COVID-19. This therefore warrants an urgent reassessment of the transmission dynamics of the current outbreak.","output":"Children Infected With SARS-CoV-2 From Family Clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 93 million cases and 2 million deaths in the world. SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infection and its main clinical manifestations such as cough and shortness of breath are well known to the scientific community. However, a growing number of studies have reported SARS-CoV-2-related gastrointestinal involvement based on clinical manifestations, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as well as on the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with coronavirus disease 2019. Furthermore, current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route and aerosol dissemination. Moreover, studies have shown a high risk of contamination through hospital surfaces and personal fomites. Indeed, viable SARS-CoV-2 specimens can be obtained from aerosols, which raises the possibility of transmission through aerosolized viral particles from feces. Therefore, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 via fecal-oral route or aerosolized particles should be considered. In addition, a possible viral spread to sources of drinking water, sewage, and rivers as well as the possible risk of viral transmission in shared toilets become a major public health concern, especially in the least developed countries. Since authors have emphasized the presence of viral RNA and even viable SARS-CoV-2 in human feces, studies on the possible fecal-oral coronavirus disease 2019 transmission become essential to understand better the dynamics of its transmission and, then, to reinforce preventive measures against this infection, leading to a more satisfactory control of the incidence of the infection.","output":"Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via fecal-oral: Current knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme class is a prevalent target for many neurodegenerative and depressive disorders. Even though scrutinization of many promising drugs for the treatment of MAO inhibition has been carried out in recent times, a conclusive structural requirement for potent activity needs to be developed. Numerous approaches have been examined for the identification of structural features for potent MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) that mainly involve an array of computational studies, synthetic approaches, and biological evaluation. In this paper, we have analyzed 2200 well-known MAOIs to expand perceptions in the chemical space of MAOIs. The physicochemical properties of the MAOIs disclosed a discernible hydrophobic feature making a bunch discrete from the central nervous system (CNS) acting drugs, as exposed using the principal component analysis (PCA). The Murcko scaffold structure study revealed unfavorable and favorable scaffold structures, in both data sets, with the highest biological activity shown by the 3-phenyl-2H-chromen-2-one scaffold. This scaffold showed a polypharmacological effect. R-group disintegration and automatic structureCactivity relationship (SAR) study resulted in identification of substructures responsible for the inhibitory bioactivity of the MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes. Moreover, with activity cliff analysis, significant biological activity was detected by simple molecular conversion in the chemical compound structure. In addition, we used the machine learning tool to generate a hypothesis wherein pyrazole, benzene ring, and amide containing structural functionalities can exhibit potential biological activities.

METHODS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation was performed according to the local practice, and target AIs were evaluated. The actual AI was calculated as the median value of all ablation points for the anterior and posterior left atrial (LA) walls. RESULTS: A total of 450 patients from nine centers were enrolled. Patients with first-time ablation (n = 408) were divided into the FPI and non-FPI groups. In the FPI group, a higher median target AI was reported for both the anterior and posterior LA walls than those in the non-FPI group. A higher actual AI was observed for the anterior LA wall in the FPI group. The actual AI was equal to or higher than the target AI for the posterior, anterior, and both LA walls in 54%, 47%, and 35% (n = 158) cases, respectively. Parameters such as hypertension, stroke, ablation power, actual AI value on the anterior wall, target AI values on both LA walls, AI achievement on the posterior wall, carina ablation, and operator experience were all associated with FPI in a univariate logistic regression model; only carina ablation was an independent predictor of FPI.

Previous correlational evidence indicated that high levels of helplessness were associated with diminished fear of COVID-19 (Lifshin et al., 2020;Lifshin & Mikulincer, 2021). Method: We tested if manipulated perceived helplessness to avoid the virus using bogus messages (high, low or moderate helplessness) would reduce fear of COVID-19, state anxiety, and motivation for protective actions. Results: Supporting the hypothesis, in the high helplessness condition, higher perceived helplessness related to less fear of COVID-19, but this did not occur in the low and moderate helplessness control conditions. Perceived helplessness in the helplessness condition also indirectly reduced state anxiety and motivation for protective actions. Discussion: This research may advance the psychological study of helplessness and our understanding of human behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The suspension of in-person dance classes during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a transition to remote provision via live and recorded digital media. An online survey explored accessibility of and engagement with home-based dance programs, as well as potential benefits and processes involved in participation. The survey was co-developed by researchers and dance program providers, with input from people with PD and physiotherapists. Responses were collected from 276 individuals, including 178 current users of home-based programs, the majority of whom were participating at least once per week. Among respondents not currently using digital resources, lack of knowledge and motivation were the primary barriers. Most participants (94.9%) reported that home based practise provided some benefits, including physical (e.g., balance, posture) and non-physical (e.g., mood, confidence) improvements. Participants valued the convenience and flexibility of digital participation, but noted limitations including reductions in social interaction, support from instructors and peers, and motivation. There was a strong preference (70.8%) for continuing with home-based practise alongside in-person classes in the future. The results indicate that at-home dance is accessible and usable for people with PD, and that some of the previously-reported benefits of dance may be replicated in this context. Digital dance programs will likely remain a key element of future provision for people with PD, and the present findings will inform further development of resources and research into mechanisms and outcomes of home-based dance participation.","output":"Dance at Home for People With Parkinson's During COVID-19 and Beyond: Participation, Perceptions, and Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence surveys provide crucial information on cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n = 3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81%-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95% CI 0.00%-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95% HDI 0.40%-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06% (95% HDI 2.97%-5.16%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95% HDI 3.18%-5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","output":"Seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Slovenia: results of two rounds of a nationwide population study on a probability-based sample, challenges and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Remote care and telehealth have the potential to expand healthcare access, and the COVID-19 pandemic has called for alternative solutions to conventional face-to-face follow-up and monitoring. However, guidance is needed on the integration of telehealth into clinical care of people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD). OBJECTIVE: To develop EULAR points to consider (PtC) for the development, prioritisation and implementation of telehealth for people with RMD. METHODS: A multidisciplinary EULAR task force (TF) of 30 members from 14 European countries was established, and the EULAR standardised operating procedures for development of PtC were followed. A systematic literature review was conducted to support the TF in formulating the PtC. The level of agreement among the TF was established by anonymous online voting. RESULTS: Four overarching principles and nine PtC were formulated. The use of telehealth should be tailored to patient's needs and preferences. The healthcare team should have adequate equipment and training and have telecommunication skills. Telehealth can be used in screening for RMD as preassessment in the referral process, for disease monitoring and regulation of medication dosages and in some non-pharmacological interventions. People with RMD should be offered training in using telehealth, and barriers should be resolved whenever possible.The level of agreement to each statement ranged from 8.5 to 9.8/10. CONCLUSION: The PtC have identified areas where telehealth could improve quality of care and increase healthcare access.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving all adults with COVID\\\\19 admitted to the ICU between March and May 2020. Patients were divided into normoglycemic (average blood glucose <140 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (average blood glucose 140 mg/dL) groups. Outcomes such as mortality, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital and ICU stays were measured. RESULTS: Among 495 patients, 58.4% were male with a median age of 68 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58.00\\\\77.00), and baseline average blood glucose was 186.6 (SD  130.8). Preexisting diabetes was present in 35.8% of the studied cohort. Combined ICU and hospital mortality rates were 23.8%; mortality and mechanical ventilation rates were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group with 31.4% vs 16.6% (P = .001) and 50.0% vs 37.2% (P = .004), respectively. Age above 60 years (hazard ratio [HR] 3.21; 95% CI 1.78, 5.78) and hyperglycemia (HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.14, 2.82) were the only significant predictors of in\\\\hospital mortality.

Mothers completed questionnaires regarding the different types of stresses they may have experienced, as well as their children's language and socioemotional development. Results indicate that, collectively, higher maternal report of stress is associated with lower reports of children's socioemotional and language development. In addition, maternal psychological appraisals of stress were associated with both socioemotional and language development, whereas reports of environmental stressors were only associated with socioemotional development.

METHODS We recruited 47 patients with mild (n=20), moderate (n=9) or severe (n=18) COVID-19 and measured two plasma biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa): neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) (a marker of intra-axonal neuronal injury) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) (a marker of astrocytic activation/injury) in samples collected at presentation and again in a subset after a mean of 11.4 days. Cross-sectional results were compared with 33 age-matched controls derived from an independent cohort. RESULTS The patients with severe COVID-19 had higher plasma concentrations of GFAp (p=0.001) and NfL (p<0.001) than controls, while GFAp was also increased in patients with moderate disease (p=0.03). In severe patients an early peak in plasma GFAp decreased upon follow-up (p<0.01) while NfL showed a sustained increase from first to last follow-up (p<0.01), perhaps reflecting a sequence of early astrocytic response and more delayed axonal injury.

Methods: A online cross-sectional survey comprised of multiple choice, ranked, and free text response questions was disseminated to medical students across all 41 UK medical schools between April and July 2020. Comparison of independent study hours and sources of study materials prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken. Motivational factors guiding resource choices and awareness of Free Open Access Meducation (FOAM) was also investigated. Results: A target sample size of 75 per medical school across a total of 41 medical schools within the UK were targeted (3075 total students). 1564 responses were included for analysis.

Due to the common effective waste management practices in some parts of the world, the plastics menace is generally well recognized and controlled worldwide.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unusual in that it appears capable of infecting many different mammal species. As a significant proportion of people worldwide are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may spread the infection unknowingly before symptoms occur or without any symptoms ever occurring, there is a non-negligible risk of humans spreading SARS-CoV-2 to wildlife, in particular to wild non-human mammals. Because of SARS-CoV-2's apparent evolutionary origins in bats and reports of humans transmitting the virus to pets and zoo animals, regulations for the prevention of human-to-animal transmission have so far focused mostly on these animal groups. We summarise recent studies and reports that show that a wide range of distantly related mammals are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and that susceptibility or resistance to the virus is, in general, not predictable, or only predictable to some extent, from phylogenetic proximity to known susceptible or resistant hosts. In the absence of solid evidence on the susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the >6500 mammal species, we argue that sanitary precautions should be taken by humans interacting with any other mammal species in the wild. Preventing human-to-wildlife SARS-CoV-2 transmission is important to protect these animals (some of which are classed as threatened) from disease, but also to avoid establishment of novel SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in wild mammals. The risk of repeated re-infection of humans from such a wildlife reservoir could severely hamper SARS-CoV-2 control efforts. Activities during which direct or indirect interaction with wild mammals may occur include wildlife research, conservation activities, forestry work, pest control, management of feral populations, ecological consultancy work, management of protected areas and natural environments, wildlife tourism and wildlife rehabilitation in animal shelters. During such activities, we recommend sanitary precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing face masks and gloves, and frequent decontamination, which are very similar to regulations currently imposed to prevent transmission among humans. We further recommend active surveillance of domestic and feral animals that could act as SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts between humans and wild mammals.","output":"Risk of human-to-wildlife transmission of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health and care sector plays a valuable role in improving population health and societal wellbeing, protecting people from the financial consequences of illness, reducing health and income inequalities, and supporting economic growth. However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 37% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection.

The primary outcome was in-hospital death defined as the case fatality rate. Research information and following-up data were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: The best cut-off value of NT-proBNP for predicting in-hospital death was 88.64 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 100% and the specificity for 66.67%. Patients with high NT-proBNP values (> 88.64 pg/mL) had a significantly increased risk of death during the days of following-up compared with those with low values (88.64 pg/mL). After adjustment for potential risk factors, NT-proBNP was independently correlated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: NT-proBNP might be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials, NCT04292964.

Following intranasal infection with the attenuated rabies virus CVS-F3, normal adult mice of different genetic backgrounds developed a transient disease characterized by loss of body weight and appetite depression which peaked at 13 days postinfection (p.i.). While these animals had completely recovered by day 21 p.i., mice lacking either B and T cells or B cells alone developed a progressive disease and succumbed to infection. Mice lacking either CD8+ T cells, IFN receptors, or complement components C3 and C4 showed no significant differences in the development of clinical signs by comparison with intact counterparts having the same genetic background. However, while infectious virus and viral RNA could be detected in normal control mice only until day 8 p.i., in all of the gene knockout mice studied except those lacking C3 and C4, virus infection persisted through day 21 p.i. Analysis of rabies virus-specific antibody production together with histological assessment of brain inflammation in infected animals revealed that clearance of CVS-F3 by 21 days p.i. correlated with both a strong inflammatory response in the CNS early in the infection (day 8 p.i.), and the rapid (day 10 p.i.) production of significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA). These studies confirm that rabies VNA is an absolute requirement for clearance of an established rabies virus infection.

However, it is associated with several pitfalls as white coat effect and masked hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is usually used for diagnosis of hypertension and elimination of white coat effect. This study aimed to assess the correlation and degree of agreement of the automated sequential blood pressure (ASqBP) with OBP and ABPM. Patients presented to hypertension clinic were included. Each patient had his blood pressure recorded by three methods: OBP using a digital sphygmomanometer device, unattended ASqBP using sequential BP devices with recording of the readings over 30 min, and ABPM that was performed within 48 h of office visit using portable BP devices with BP recording over 24 h. RESULTS: We recruited 64 patients (age 50.0  15.0 years and female gender 53.1%). We found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and OBP readings (r 0.81 for SBP and 0.83 for DBP, p < 0.001). We also found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and ABPM readings (r 0.74, p < 0.001). The ASqBP readings were lower than OBP (137.0  16.8/86.4  13.8 vs. 142.7  15.5/88.5  12.3) and close to ABPM readings (average 24 h, 134.0  15.4/88.5  12.3, and daytime, 135.8  15.7/82.1  13.7). For SBP readings, there was moderate agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). For DBP readings, there was fair agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). CONCLUSION: ASqBP measurement has good correlation with OBP and ABPM readings. Unattended automated office pressure has moderate degree of agreement with ABPM for the SBP& fair degree of agreement for the DBP. It can be used in the hypertension clinics to eliminate the problems of white coat effect and marked BP variability.","output":"The use of automated sequential blood pressure in hypertension clinics compared with office and ambulatory blood pressure measurements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.

Here, we report seven cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the perioperative period of lung resection. Retrospective analysis suggested that one patient had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery and the other six patients contracted the infection after the lung resection. Fever, lymphopenia, and ground-glass opacities revealed on computed tomography are the most common clinical manifestations of the patients who contracted COVID-19 after the lung resection. Pathologic studies of the specimens of these seven patients were performed. Pathologic examination of patient 1, who was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery, revealed that apart from the tumor, there was a wide range of interstitial inflammation with plasma cell and macrophage infiltration. High density of macrophages and foam cells in the alveolar cavities, but no obvious proliferation of pneumocyte, was found.

Automation has the potential to build such models with applications to time-critical environments so that a clinician will be able to utilize the model outcomes in real-time decision making at bedside.

should, in principle, provide policy- and decision-makers with a greater situational awareness regarding their potential risk Yet most of those models ignore the tail risk of contagious diseases, use point forecasts, and the reliability of their parameters is rarely questioned and incorporated in the projections We argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing (and managing) the real risk of pandemics is provided by extreme value theory (EVT), an approach that has historically been developed to treat phenomena in which extremes (maxima or minima) and not averages play the role of the protagonist, being the fundamental source of risk By analysing data for pandemic outbreaks spanning over the past 2500 years, we show that the related distribution of fatalities is strongly fat-tailed, suggesting a tail risk that is unfortunately largely ignored in common epidemiological models We use a dual distribution method, combined with EVT, to extract information from the

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Data were reviewed from 580 patients with HCCs measuring 3 cm or smaller (BCLC stage 0 or A) who underwent ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous RF ablation (n = 438) or NAR (n = 142) as a first-line treatment. Local tumor progression, intrahepatic distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were analyzed by using propensity score matching to compare therapeutic efficacy. In addition, major complications and length of postoperative hospital stay were compared. RESULTS Before propensity score matching (n = 580), the 5-year cumulative rates of local tumor progression for RF ablation and NAR (20.9% vs 12.7%, respectively; P = .093) and overall survival rates (85.5% vs 90.9%, respectively; P = .194) were comparable, while the 5-year cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence rates (62.7% vs 36.6%, respectively; P < .001) and disease-free survival rates (31.7% vs 61.1%, respectively; P < .001) in the NAR group were significantly better than those in the RF ablation group. After matching (n = 198), there were no significant differences in therapeutic outcomes between the RF ablation and NAR groups, including 5-year cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence (47.0% vs 40.2%, respectively; P = .240) and disease-free survival rates (48.9% vs 54.4%, respectively; P = .201). RF ablation was superior to NAR for major complication rates and length of postoperative hospital stay (P < .001). CONCLUSION In patients with one BCLC stage 0 or A ( 3 cm) HCC who received RF ablation or NAR as first-line treatment, there were no significant differences in long-term therapeutic outcomes; however, RF ablation was associated with fewer major complications and a shorter hospital stay after treatment.","output":"Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Radiofrequency Ablation versus Nonanatomic Resection--Propensity Score Analyses of Long-term Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The etiological diagnosis of bronchopulmonary infections cannot be assessed with clinical, radiological and epidemiological data alone Viruses have been demonstrated to cause a large proportion of these infections, both in children and adults BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of viral bronchopulmonary infections is based on the analysis of secretions, collected from the lower respiratory tract when possible, by techniques that detect either influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, or a large panel of viruses that can be responsible for respiratory disease The latter, called multiplex PCR assays, allow a syndromic approach to respiratory infection Their high cost for the laboratory raises the question of their place in the management of patients in terms of antibiotic economy and isolation In the absence of clear recommendations, the strategy and equipment are very unevenly distributed in France OUTLOOK: Medico-economic analyses need to be performed in France to evaluate the place of these tests in the management of patients The evaluation of the role of the different viruses often detected in co-infection, especially in children, also deserves the attention of virologists and clinicians CONCLUSIONS: The availability of new diagnostic technologies, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, together with the availability of new antiviral drugs are likely to impact future recommendations for the management of viral bronchopulmonary infections","output":"[Virological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 experience multiple clinical conditions that may cause electrolyte imbalances. Hypokalemia is a concerning electrolyte disorder closely associated with severe complications. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 non-ICU admitted patients with COVID-19 at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy, from February 16 to April 14, 2020. RESULTS: Hypokalemia was detected in 119 out of 290 patients (41%) during hospitalization. Mean serum potassium was 3.1  0.1 meq/L. The majority of patients (90.7%) patients experienced only a mild decrease in serum potassium level (3C3.4 mEq/L). Hypokalemia was associated with hypocalcemia, which was detected in 50% of subjects. Urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio, measured in a small number of patients (n = 45; 36.1%), revealed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in most cases (95.5%). Risk factors for hypokalemia were female sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.44; 95% CI 1.36C4.37; P 0.003) and diuretic therapy (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.08C3.48; P 0.027). Hypokalemia, adjusted for sex, age and SOFA score, was not associated with ICU transfer (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.228C1.212; P = 0.131), in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.47; 95% CI 0.170C1.324; P = 0.154) and composite outcome of ICU transfer or in-hospital mortality (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.222C1.047; P = 0.065) in our cohort of patients.

The back log of cases from the COVID pandemic presented a challenge where we were seeing an increase in the daily census. Historically we have had challenges when the daily surgical patient census was more than 35 patients. Our multiple rapid, high turnover cases along with a lack of space in PACU, caused delays and a decrease in number of cases performed each day and dissatisfaction among surgeons, staff, and families. Goal was to increase efficiency by freeing up space in the PACU department, create Phase II recovery with cross-trained Acute Care Nurses, maintain a revenue stream, and improve physician, staff, patient and family satisfaction. Utilizing ASPAN's Practice Recommendation and American Society of Anesthesiologists Standards for Post-anesthesia Care, we developed criteria that identified patients who met criteria for transfer to Phase II supported by the Aldrete Scoring System. Through collaboration with nursing leaders, we cross-trained Acute Care nurses to Phase II. Leadership identified hours of Phase II operation, which patients we would send to Phase II, and developed a plan to support the Phase II staff.

Utilizing publicly available injury data will allow for greater transparency for stakeholders to use the data as a shared resource to create future basketball injury prevention programs. PURPOSE: To describe injury and illness incidence, severity, and temporal trends in National Basketball Association (NBA) players. Among those who develop time-loss injury or illness, we estimated severity based on games missed because of injury or illness. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Publicly available NBA data were extracted through a reproducible computer-programmed process from the 2008 to 2019 seasons. Data were externally validated by 2 independent reviewers through other publicly available data sources. Injury and illness were calculated per 1000 athlete game-exposures (AGEs). Injury severity was calculated as games missed because of injury or illness. Injury and illness data were stratified by body part, position, severity (slight, minor, moderate, or severe), month, and year. RESULTS: A total of 1369 players played a total of 302,018 player-games, with a total of 5375 injuries and illnesses. The overall injury and illness incidence was 17.80 per 1000 AGEs. The median injury severity was 3 games (interquartile range, 0-6 games) missed per injury. Overall, 33% of injuries were classified as slight; 26%, as minor; 26%, as moderate; and 15%, as severe. The ankle (2.57 injuries/1000 AGEs), knee (2.44 injuries/1000 AGEs), groin/hip/thigh (1.99 injuries/1000 AGEs), and illness (1.85 illnesses/1000 AGEs) had the greatest incidence of injury and illness. Neither injury or illness incidence nor severity was different among basketball playing positions. Injury incidence demonstrated increasing incremental trends with season progression. Injuries were similar throughout the 11-year reporting period, except for a substantial increase in the lockout-shortened 2012 season.

Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated with indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.","output":"Assessment of event-triggered policies of nonpharmaceutical interventions based on epidemiological indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author discussed recently the possible molecular mechanisms that cause the COVID-19 disease symptoms. Here the analysis of the recent experimental data supports the hypothesis that production of the gut microbial tryptamine can be induced by the SARS-CoV-2 fecal viral activity due to the selective pressure or positive selection of tryptamine-producing microorganisms. In this report, the author suggests that the mechanism of microbial selection bases on the abilities of tryptamine to affect the viral nucleic acid. In other words, the gut microorganisms producing tryptamine are more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 fecal viral activity than microorganisms producing no tryptamine. Earlier we demonstrated the induction of neurodegeneration by tryptamine in human cells and mouse brain. Furthermore, we were able to uncover the human gut bacteria associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) using PCR testing of human fecal samples with the new-designed primers targeting the tryptophan-tryptamine pathway. Likely, SARS-CoV-2 is one of the selective pressure factors in the cascade accelerating the neurodegenerative process in AD. This suggestion is consistent with a higher proportion of AD patients among COVID-19 related victims. Gut microbial tryptamine increase due to the viral infection-induced dysbiosis can synergize and potentiate the tryptamine cytotoxicity, necrotizing ability and other properties as a virulence factor.","output":"Induction of Gut Microbial Tryptamine by SARS-CoV-2 in Nonhuman Primate Model Consistent with Tryptamine-Induced Model of Neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to determine the viral frequency and clinical-epidemiological characteristics in the episodes of acute respiratory infection in patients of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Ni?o San Borja in Lima, the information of the episodes of patients who required at least one direct Immunofluorescence test from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 was analyzed. 1153 episodes were identified in 707 patients.

CONCLUSION: The performance of nonemergency neurosurgery can start once minimum criteria have been fulfilled: 1) a structured prioritization of surgical cases; 2) virus infection incidence decreased sufficiently to release previously diverted healthcare resources; 3) adequate safety criteria met for patients and staff, including sufficient personal protective equipment and robust testing availability; and 4) maintenance of systems for rapid communication at organizational and individual levels.","output":"An Exit Strategy for Resuming Nonemergency Neurosurgery after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A United Kingdom Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The precarious financial status of the majority of Hawai'i residents coupled with the state's heavy reliance on tourism suggests that residents are particularly vulnerable to increased economic hardship resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down the tourism industry and continues to erect barriers for resuming operations.

This review presents new data related to HIV-associated TB in children and adolescents. Data on the epidemiology of HIV-associated TB suggests that an elevated risk of TB in children and adolescents with HIV persists even with broad implementation of ART. Recent guidance also indicates the need for new screening strategies for HIV-associated TB. There have been major advances in the availability of new antiretroviral medications and also TB prevention options for children, but these advances have come with additional questions surrounding drugCdrug interactions and dosing in younger age groups. Finally, we review new approaches to manage post-TB lung disease in children living with HIV. Collectively, we present data on the rapidly evolving field of HIV-associated child tuberculosis.

Coiling remains a first-line treatment for small, morphologically simple aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To compare coiling and flow diversion in small, uncomplicated intracranial aneurysms (typically amenable to coiling). METHODS Forty patients treated with the pipeline embolization device (PED) for small (<10 mm), morphologically simple aneurysms that would have also been amenable to coiling were identified. These patients were matched in a 1:1 fashion with 40 patients with comparable aneurysms treated with coiling. Matching was based on age, gender, aneurysm size, and aneurysm morphology. RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable with regard to baseline characteristics including age, gender, and aneurysm size. The complication rate did not differ between the 2 groups (2.5% with coiling vs 5% with PED; P = .6). Multivariate analysis did not identify any predictor of complications. Complete occlusion (100%) at follow-up was significantly higher in patients treated with PED (70%) than coiling (47.5%, P = .04). In multivariate analysis, treatment with PED predicted aneurysm obliteration ( P = .04). A significantly higher proportion of coiled patients (32.5%) required retreatment compared with flow diversion (5%, P = .003). In multivariate analysis, coiling predicted retreatment ( P = .006). All patients achieved a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale: 0-2) regardless of group. CONCLUSION This matched analysis suggests that flow diversion provides higher occlusion rates, lower retreatment rates, and no additional morbidity compared with coiling in small, simple aneurysms amenable to both techniques. These results suggest a potential benefit for flow diversion over coiling even in small, uncomplicated aneurysms.","output":"Matched Comparison of Flow Diversion and Coiling in Small, Noncomplex Intracranial Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are overwhelmed by scientific publications on clinical observations, virology and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

The accuracy of molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been assessed numerous times, usually in reference to a gold standard diagnosis. One major disadvantage of that approach is the possibility of error due to inaccuracy of the gold standard, which is especially problematic for evaluating testing in a real-world surveillance context. We used an alternative approach known as Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM), which circumvents the need to designate a gold standard by simultaneously estimating the accuracy of multiple tests. We applied this technique to a collection of 1,716 tests of three types applied to 853 individuals on a university campus during a one-week period in October 2020. We found that reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of saliva samples performed at a campus facility had higher sensitivity (median: 0.923; 95% credible interval: 0.732-0.996) than RT-PCR testing of nasal samples performed at a commercial facility (median: 0.859; 95% CrI: 0.547-0.994). The reverse was true for specificity, although the specificity of saliva testing was still very high (median: 0.993; 95% CrI: 0.983-0.999). An antigen test was less sensitive and specific than both of the RT-PCR tests.

Because sex significantly impacts immune responses and the course of COVID-19, the ratios could be biased by sex. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate sex-dependent differences in the contribution of NLR, PLR, MLR, and MPR to COVID-19 severity and mortality upon hospital admission using a sample of pneumonia patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This single-center observational cross-sectional study included 3,280 confirmed COVID-19 cases (CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic) from Quito (Ecuador). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to identify optimal cut-offs of the above parameters when discriminating severe COVID-19 pneumonia and mortality risks after segregation by sex. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as having PaO(2) < 60 mmHg and SpO(2) < 94%, whereas non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as having PaO(2)  60 mmHg and SpO(2)  94%. RESULTS: The mortality rate of COVID-19 among men was double that in women. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia and non-surviving patients had a higher level of NLR, MLR, PLR, and MPR. The medians of NLR, MLR, and MPR in men were significantly higher, but PLR was not different between men and women. In men, these ratios had lower cut-offs than in women (NLR: 2.42 vs. 3.31, MLR: 0.24 vs. 0.35, and PLR: 83.9 vs. 151.9). The sensitivity of NLR, MLR, and PLR to predict pneumonia severity was better in men (69C77%), whereas their specificity was enhanced in women compared to men (70C76% vs. 23C48%). CONCLUSION: These ratios may represent widely available biomarkers in COVID-19 since they were significant predictors for disease severity and mortality although with different performances in men and women.","output":"Sex-Dependent Performance of the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte, Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte, Platelet-to-Lymphocyte and Mean Platelet Volume-to-Platelet Ratios in Discriminating COVID-19 Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Despite the global introduction of physical literacy in recent years, a lack of a comprehensive physical literacy tool is still evident in adolescents.

METHODS The level of compliance for each subject was evaluated with a self-administered questionnaire together with microbiological examination of their contact lenses, lens cases and lens care solutions. The effect of an intervention to improve the level of compliance was determined by a controlled trial. A regular self-review exercise on proper lens handling was given to the test group once every three months for 12 months. The levels of compliance and contamination of contact lenses and lens care accessories between test and control groups were compared at the end of the 12-month period to evaluate the effect of the intervention. RESULTS Sixty-five subjects who were experienced contact lens wearers were recruited and 60 completed the study. All showed some degree of non-compliance in the care of their contact lenses and lens accessories. Most (about 60 per cent) were non-compliant with at least six of a total of 15 lens care procedures. The most common non-compliant behaviour among contact lens wearers was associated with the care of the lens case. By the end of the study period, our compliance enhancement strategy did not appear to have had a significant effect on the behaviour of our subjects, except for improvement in the care of lens cases. Compliance for other procedures improved in both test and control groups. CONCLUSION All subjects showed some degree of non-compliance and the spectrum of non-compliance was wide.

In this perspective, we assessed the efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 70 CLL pts followed up at single hematological institution. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Serologic testing for SARS Cov2 IgG was performed using the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test (DiaSorin; Saluggia, Italy), a chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of anti-S1 and anti-S2 specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Clinical sensitivity and specificity of assay were 98.7% and 99.5% respectively. Samples were considered negative for antibody titers below 13 AU/ml. Results were compared with those of an age-matched group of subjects with no hematological malignancy (n=57). Patient samples for serology testing were obtained after median time of 14 days (range, 14-28) from the second vaccine dose. Median age of CLL pts was 72 years (range, 63-88) and 71.4% were males. The median time from CLL diagnosis to vaccination was 82.5 mo. (range, 1-280). Twenty-three pts (32.9%) were treatment na?ve (TN), 36 (51.4%) on active therapy (i.e., BTKi, 22; anti-BCL2 12; PI3Ki,1; cyclophosphamide,1) and 11 (15.7%) off-therapy (i.e., 8 in complete [CR] or partial remission [PR], and 3 in CLL relapse). Of note, 9 (25.7%) of 35 pts on therapy with a pathway inhibitor (PI) at the time of vaccination had been given an anti-CD20 antibody. The vaccine elicited an antibody-mediated response in 41 (58.5%) of the 70 CLL pts. An inferior response rate [RR] (58.5% vs 100%, OR, 0.012 [0.0007-0.206];P=0.02) and a lower antibody titers (median, 58 AU/ml; range, 1.8-800 vs. 284 AU/ml; range, 14-800; P< 0.0001) were observed in CLL pts in comparison to age-matched subjects with no hematological malignancy. The RR was higher in TN (87%) or off-therapy pts with sustained clinical response (87.5%) in comparison to pts on therapy at the time of vaccination (41.7%)(<0.0001). Similar results were observed when comparison was performed in terms of antibody titers (P=0.02;Kruskall-Wallis test; Fig 1). In comparison to pts treated with a PI as monotherapy, those who received an anti-CD20 antibody in association to PI had a lower antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (11.1% vs 53.8%; OR,0.107 [0.011-0.984];P=0.04). In univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: early Rai stage (i.e.,0-I) (OR, 0.36 [0.13-0.97];P=0.04), mutated IGHV status (OR,0.30 [0.10-0.88]; P=0.02), lack of active therapy - which comprised TN and off-therapy pts with sustained response - (OR,0.09 [0.03-0.32];P<0.0001), and no anti-CD20 antibody exposure preceding vaccination (OR, 013 [0.01-1.23];P=0.04). Levels of immunoglobulins or absolute values of CD3,CD4,CD8, and CD16/CD56 cells measured before the first COVID-19 vaccination were not associated to vaccine response. Of note, in pts who experienced a serological response a concomitant increase of the absolute of CD16/CD56 positive cells was observed (P=0.02). Finally, Rai stage (OR, 0.19 [0.05-0.79]; P=0.02) and treatment status (OR, 0.06 [0.02-0.27]; P<0.0001) were independent predictors of response in multivariate analysis. We used these factors to build a score that identified pts with different pattern of response to vaccine. Serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was 100% in pts with no factor (n=21), 45% in pts. with one factor (n=38) and 36% in pts with two factors (n=11) (P<0.0001).

BACKGROUND: The stress level of clinical nurses directly affects their physical and mental health and work efficiency. DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, which was performed following the STROBE checklist. The current study was conducted in February 2020 by selecting clinical nurses from the Zigong First People's Hospital for investigation. METHODS: At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we assessed clinical nurses with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Specifically, the nurses were divided into three groups: (a) nurses supporting Wuhan; (b) nurses in the department of treating the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (epidemic department); and (c) nurses in the general department without the COVID-19 patients in our hospital (non-epidemic department). RESULTS: A total of 1092 clinical nurses were surveyed with 94 nurses in Wuhan, 130 nurses treating COVID-19 patients in our hospital and 868 nurses working without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The mean stress score of all surveyed nurses was 33.15 (SD: 25.551). There was a statistically significant difference in stress response scores between different departments. Noticeably, the nurses who went to support in Wuhan showed a weaker stress response than the nurses who stayed in our hospital (mean: 19.98 (Wuhan) vs. 32.70 (epidemic department in our hospital) vs. 34.64 (non-epidemic department in our hospital)). In addition, stress was negatively correlated with general self-efficacy and perceived social support. CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that the stress status of second-line nurse without direct contact with diagnosed COVID-19 patients was more severe than that of first-line nurses who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients.

However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. METHODS: The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (N = 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. RESULTS: People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","output":"Coping strategies and mental health trajectories during the first 21 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The complex physiology and medical requirements of children with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) challenge traditional care coordination models. While the involvement of multiple clinical subspecialty services is often necessary to support different care processes and individual organ system dysfunctions, it can also delay the diagnostic process, monitoring, and treatment. The logistics of coordinating with many specialty providers for critically ill patients are challenging and time consuming, and often can result in fragmented communication. To address these and other related issues, we developed a new multi-disciplinary consult service focused on streamlining diagnostics, management, and communication for patients with sepsis and MODS-associated immune dysregulation. The service, called the Program in Inflammation, Immunity, and the Microbiome (PrIIMe), is now a hospital-wide clinical consult service at our institution caring for a broad group of patients with immune dysregulation, particularly focusing on patients with sepsis and MODS. In this paper, we summarize the development, structure, and function of the program, as well as the initial impact. This information may be helpful to clinicians and healthcare leaders who are developing multi-disciplinary consult services for children with complex care needs, especially those with sepsis and MODS-associated immune dysregulation.

Each data set was divided training data and study data. Images were classified as atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumonia, or no emergency. DenseNet-121, as a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network was used and ensemble learning was performed on the best-performing algorithms. Diagnostic accuracy and processing time were compared to those of ICU physicians. Results: In the single Japanese hospital data, the area under the curve (AUC) of diagnostic accuracy was 0.768. The area under the curve (AUC) of diagnostic accuracy significantly improved as the number of radiograph readings increased from 25 to 100% in the NIH data set. The AUC was higher than 0.9 for all categories toward the end of training with a large sample size. The time to complete 53 radiographs by machine learning was 70 times faster than the time taken by ICU physicians (9.66 s vs. 12 min).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study of adults with unplanned hospitalizations at 51 hospitals across 6 Western states. EXPOSURES: Unplanned hospitalizations occurring during the spring COVID-19 surge (March 4 to May 13, 2020; Period 1), an intervening period (May 14 to October 19, 2020; Period 2), and the fall COVID-19 surge (October 20 to December 31, 2020; Period 3) were compared with a pre-COVID-19 baseline period from January 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We examined daily hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality overall and in 30 conditions. RESULTS: Unplanned hospitalizations declined steeply during Periods 1 and 3 (by 47.5% and 25% compared with baseline, respectively). Although volumes declined, adjusted in-hospital mortality rose from 2.9% in the pre-pandemic period to 3.5% in Period 1 (20.7% relative increase), returning to baseline in Period 2, and rose again to 3.4% in Period 3.

DESIGN Experimental study. ANIMALS Purpose-bred male hound-mix research dogs (n = 8). METHODS Dogs were randomized to groups of left or right-sided laparoscopic surgical approaches. Three transperitoneal portals were established with the dogs in lateral recumbency, and ipsilateral MILN dissection was achieved under CO2 pneumoperitoneum using a vessel-sealing device. RESULTS MILN ipsilateral to the approach were successfully identified and removed laparoscopically in 8 dogs. Observed complications included mild to moderate hemorrhage that was controlled laparoscopically in 4 dogs, and tearing of the MILN capsule during retraction and dissection in 3 dogs. No other major complications occurred and all dogs recovered uneventfully. Areas of either minor peripheral (9/9) or central (4/9) pinch artifact affected a median percentage of 5% of surface area (range, 5-30%) of bisected lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic MILN extirpation is feasible in dogs with normal MILN and may serve as a minimally invasive approach for excisional biopsy in the diagnostic staging of canine onocologic patients with normal-sized MILN. This lateral laparoscopic approach allows dissection of the ipsilateral MILN but precludes removal of the contralateral MILN.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the key factors of sequela-free survival.ResultsThe follow-up period for the 464 patients was 10 August to 30 September 2020. Of these, 424 patients completed the assessment of all scales. 30.2% (128 of 424) were categorised as sequela-free at follow-up. The most common sequelae were psychosocial problems (254 [57.7%]), respiratory function abnormality (149 [32.6%]) and cardiac function abnormality (98 [21.5%]). Risk factors associated with COVID-19 sequelae were anaemia on admission, longer duration from the onset of symptoms to admission and advanced age, whereas anti-anaemia treatment was a protective factor against sequelae. A haemoglobin level of <113 g/l for female patients or <92 g/l for male patients at admission discriminated a higher risk of any COVID-19 sequelae.Conclusions: Only one third COVID-19 survivors were sequela-free.

However, very few studies have considered consumption-based carbon emissions, even though a clear understanding of the impact of consumption patterns is essential for redirecting the pattern to more sustainable consumption. Thus, this study takes a step forward by using consumption-based carbon emissions (CCO(2)) as a proxy of environmental degradation using the novel non-linear ARDL technique for Chilefrom 1990 to 2018. To the best understanding of the investigators, no prior studies have investigated the drivers of consumption-based carbon emissions utilizing non-linear ARDL. The study employed ADF and KSS (non-linear) tests to check the data series stationary level. Additionally, the symmetric and asymmetric ARDL approaches are utilized to explore cointegration and long-run linkages. According to the results, there is no symmetric cointegration among the variables; however, the empirical estimates reveal a long-run asymmetric connection between the indicators and CCO(2) emissions. The novel results from the asymmetric ARDL indicate that negative and positive changes in economic growth deteriorate the quality of the environment. Interestingly, a reduction in economic growth makes a more dominant contribution to environmental degradation. Moreover, positive changes in renewable energy usage improve the quality of Chiles environment, inferring that the country can achieve a reduction in environmental degradation by boosting renewable energy consumption. Surprisingly, the study found that technological innovation is ineffective in reducing consumption-based carbon emissions, which implies that Chiles technological innovation is not directed towards manufacturing green technology.

OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal trends in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular conditions across a tertiary care healthcare system. METHODS: We tracked acute cardiovascular hospitalizations between January 1st, 2019 and March 31st, 2020. We estimated daily hospitalization rates using negative binomial models. Temporal trends in hospitalization rates were compared across the first 3 months of 2020, with the first 3 months of 2019 as a reference. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, 6,083 patients experienced 7,187 hospitalizations for primary acute cardiovascular reasons. There was 43.4% (27.4% to 56.0%) fewer estimated daily hospitalizations in March 2020 as compared with March 2019 (P<0.001).

It was first observed in children, however few cases of adults with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A) were published in the US and the UK. We present two cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in adults which occurred in Germany. HISTORY: #1: A 27-year-old male presented with fever (40a??C), right lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and peritonism. #2: A 21-year-old female presented with fever (40a??C) occipital headaches, neck stiffness, and somnolence. FINDINGS: #1: Increased inflammation parameters and elevated Nt-proBNP were found. Abdominal CT showed signs of ileitis terminalis and colitis. Crohn's disease was excluded endoscopically. Echocardiography showed minor pericardial effusion. A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. #2: Increased inflammation parameters and an increased Nt-proBNP were found. Cranial CT showed pathology. Meningitis was excluded via lumbar puncture. Thoracic CT and abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of infection. Echocardiography showed reduced LVEF (50a??%). A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. THERAPY AND COURSE: #1: Antibiotic therapy as well as oral prednisolone didn't improve the clinical course. High-dose vasopressor therapy was necessary. The clinical condition improved only after adding hydrocortisone therapy. #2 Despite antibiotic therapy the clinical condition deteriorated. Because of insufficient effect of hydrocortisone, high-dose immunoglobulins were administered. Consequently, symptoms improved and LVEF normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome presents as a chameleon of symptoms. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rising numbers of cases in adults can be expected. In patients with fever, increased inflammation parameters and lack of other explanations, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome must be considered. Due to the potential severity of clinical courses and possible cardiac involvement, a therapy with hydrocortisone, ASS and immunoglobulins should be considered early.","output":"[First Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection in Adults in Germany]./ Erste F?lle des Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome nach SARS-CoV-2-Infektion bei jungen Erwachsenen in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le 30/01/2020, lOMS dclare une urgence de Sant Publique de porte internationale suite  lpidmie de COVID-19 Les consquences des pidmies sont nombreuses, aussi bien pour les patients que pour lensemble du systme de sant Cette tude a pour but dvaluer les consquences de lpidmie COVID-19 sur lorganisation des soins  lchelle hospitalire Matriels et mthodes Nous avons rcolt des donnes sur la rponse pidmique dans un h?pital prenant en charge des patients infects par le SARS-CoV-2  laide de plusieurs sources : entretiens individuels semi-structurs, priodes dobservation ethnographique in situ et analyse documentaire Les entretiens ont t raliss auprs des diffrents professionnels de lh?pital Les diffrents points de vue et niveaux organisationnels ont t envisags lors des entretiens  laide dune approche adaptative et itrative Les entretiens taient enregistrs, transcrits et cods  laide du logiciel NVivo 12 Les donnes qualitatives ont t analyses par une analyse thmatique inductive Rsultats Nous avons ralis 37 entretiens avec des personnels de sant (infirmier/e/s, mdecins, aides-soignant/e/s, manipulateurs radiologiques, cadres de sant) dans plusieurs services (urgences, maladies infectieuses, ranimation, chirurgie cardiaque, quipe dhygine) et avec des personnels administratifs (personnel de scurit, de logistique, de communication et de direction) Nous avons galement collect plus de 100heures dobservation ethnographique Concernant la rponse  lpidmie, nous avons identifi des lments facilitateurs comme la gestion de cas suspects pour les pidmies antrieures (MERS-CoV et Ebola), la ralisation dexercices rguliers par lquipe dhygine, et lexistence pralable de protocoles mais aussi des problmes non anticips comme la gestion des dchets  risques biologiques, des difficults  recruter des infirmiers intrimaires ou la pression mdiatique et les rumeurs Les consquences de lpidmie ont t directes ;rorganisation du service de maladies infectieuses, de ranimation mdicale et de virologie mais galement indirectes ;diminution de lactivit de lquipe mobile dinfectiologie et des activits denseignement, inquitude des patients non concerns et annulation de rendez-vous Ont t souligns par les participants limportance de maintenir la cohsion des quipes entre personnels travaillant auprs de patients infects par le SARS-CoV-2 et personnels non impliqus, dintgrer de fa?on harmonieuse la recherche clinique dans la prise en charge mdicale et de raliser un travail de veille bibliographique en temps rel afin dactualiser la prise en charge des cas possibles et confirms Conclusion Lpidmie COVID-19 a eu de nombreuses consquences sur lorganisation aussi bien des services mdicaux concerns que des services non directement impliqus et des services administratifs Cette tude permet didentifier des pistes damlioration pour la rponse pidmique","output":"Quelles sont les consquences de lpidmie COVID-19 sur lorganisation des soins ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Building on Ernest Gellners theory of the nation-state and drawing on insights from John Lukacs and George Kennan, this article contends that the major powers of the contemporary Indo-Pacific are characterized by conflicting nationalisms.

Firstly, we would like the readers to recognize the difference between observable and unobservable events in infectious disease epidemiology. Since both infection event and acquisition of infectiousness are generally not directly observable, the total number of infected individuals could not be counted at a point of time, unless very rigorous contact tracing and microbiological examinations were performed. Directly observable intrinsic parameters, such as the incubation period and serial interval, play key roles in translating observable to unobservable information. Secondly, the concept of dependent happening must be remembered to identify a risk of an infectious disease or to assess vaccine efficacy. Observation of a single infected individual is not independent of observing other individuals. A simple solution for dependent happening is to employ the transmission probability which is conditioned on an exposure to infection.","output":"Two Critical Issues in Quantitative Modeling of Communicable Diseases: Inference of Unobservables and Dependent Happening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dental personnel are ranked among the highest risk occupations for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their close proximity to the patient's mouth and many aerosol generating procedures encountered in dental practice. One method to reduce aerosols in dental settings is the use of intraoral evacuation systems. Intraoral evacuation systems are placed directly into a patient's mouth and maintain a dry field during procedures by capturing liquid and aerosols. Although multiple intraoral dental evacuation systems are commercially available, the efficacy of these systems is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of four dental evacuation systems at mitigating aerosol exposures during simulated ultrasonic scaling and crown preparation procedures. We conducted real-time respirable (PM4) and thoracic (PM10) aerosol sampling during ultrasonic scaling and crown preparation procedures while using four commercially available evacuation systems: a high-volume evacuator (HVE) and three alternative intraoral systems (A, B, C). Four trials were conducted for each system. Respirable and thoracic mass concentrations were measured during procedures at three locations including (1) near the breathing zone (BZ) of the dentist, (2) edge of the dental operatory room approximately 0.9 m away from the mannequin mouth, and (3) hallway supply cabinet located approximately 1.5 m away from the mannequin mouth. Respirable and thoracic mass concentrations measured during each procedure were compared with background concentrations measured in each respective location. Use of System A or HVE reduced thoracic (System A) and respirable (HVE) mass concentrations near the dentist's BZ to median background concentrations most often during the ultrasonic scaling procedure. During the crown preparation, use of System B or HVE reduced thoracic (System B) and respirable (HVE or System B) near the dentist's BZ to median background concentrations most often. Although some differences in efficacy were noted during each procedure and aerosol size fraction, the difference in median mass concentrations among evacuation systems was minimal, ranging from 0.01 to 1.48 g/m3 across both procedures and aerosol size fractions.","output":"Efficacy of dental evacuation systems for aerosol exposure mitigation in dental clinic settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The median time from symptoms onset to viral RNA shedding was 19 days.

Prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem, in principle. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyze the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.","output":"Prior knowledge elicitation: The past, present, and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population.

The social meanings attached to masks may influence their use, but remain underinvestigated. METHODS: We systematically searched eight databases for studies containing qualitative data on public mask use during past epidemics, and used meta-ethnography to explore their social meanings. We compared key concepts within and across studies, then jointly wrote a critical synthesis. RESULTS: We found nine studies from China (n=5), Japan (n=1), Mexico (n=1), South Africa (n=1) and the USA (n=1). All studies describing routine mask use during epidemics were from East Asia. Participants identified masks as symbols of solidarity, civic responsibility and an allegiance to science. This effect was amplified by heightened risk perception (eg, during SARS in 2003), and by seeing masks on political leaders and in outdoor public spaces. Masks also acted as containment devices to manage threats to identity at personal and collective levels. In China and Japan, public and corporate campaigns framed routine mask use as individual responsibility for disease prevention in return for state- or corporate-sponsored healthcare access. In most studies, mask use waned as risk perception fell. In contexts where masks were mostly worn by patients with specific diseases (eg, for patients with tuberculosis in South Africa), or when trust in government was low (eg, during H1N1 in Mexico), participants described masks as stigmatising, uncomfortable or oppressive. CONCLUSION: Face masks can take on positive social meanings linked to solidarity and altruism during epidemics. Unfortunately, these positive meanings can fail to take hold when risk perception falls, rules are seen as complex or unfair, and trust in government is low. At such times, ensuring continued use is likely to require additional efforts to promote locally appropriate positive social meanings, simplifying rules for use and ensuring fair enforcement.","output":"Boundaries of solidarity: a meta-ethnography of mask use during past epidemics to inform SARS-CoV-2 suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little research has examined the impact of working within the context of COVID-19 on UK healthcare professionals (HCPs) mental health and well-being, despite previous pandemic findings indicating that HCPs are particularly vulnerable to suffering PTSD and other mental health difficulties due to the nature of healthcare work. Specifically, it appears that no research has employed qualitative methodologies to explore the effects of working amidst COVID-19 on mental health for HCPs in the UK. Objective: To qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one centred on specific challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic, such as redeployment, isolation from loved ones, infection concerns, lack of PPE and impact on patient interpersonal care. Theme two offered insights into the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs, while many experienced feelings of fear, sadness and hypervigilance, all also demonstrated a marked resilience. Finally, many felt undervalued and misunderstood, and wished to press upon the general public seriousness of the disease. Conclusion: To the authors knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort. ? 2021 The Author(s).

RESULTS: Of the 13 accredited Hajj travel agents, 9 (69%) were interviewed. A high level of awareness regarding gastrointestinal infections, standard hygiene methods, and the risk of injury was noted among the participants and was included in advice provided to pilgrims. However, very limited knowledge and provision of advice about the risk of respiratory infections was identified. Knowledge of the compulsory meningococcal vaccine was high, and all participated travel agents reported influenza vaccine (a recommended vaccine) as a second compulsory vaccine for Hajj visas. Conversely, participants reported very limited knowledge about other recommended vaccines for Hajj. The Ministry of Hajj website and personal Hajj experience were the main sources of information.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been found to improve the psychological health outcomes of HCPs. To date, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have primarily focused upon empirical investigations into the reduction of stress amongst HCPs using MBSR and are limited to empirical studies published before December 2019. This systematic review aimed to update the current evidence base and broaden our understanding of the effectiveness of MBSR on improving the psychological functioning of HCPs. METHODS: Three electronic databases (Medline, Psych Info and Web of Science) were searched without time frame restrictions. Quantitative studies included randomised controlled trials, clinical controlled trials, pre-post designs and studies with up to a 12-month follow-up period. All studies included in the review employed a MBSR programme, standardised measures of psychological functioning and qualified HCPs as participants. RESULTS: Using PRISMA guidelines thirty studies were included in the review. The reviewed literature suggested that MBSR was effective in reducing HCPs experiences of anxiety, depression and stress. MBSR was also found to be effective in increasing HCP levels of mindfulness and self-compassion. However, MBSR did not appear as effective in reducing burnout or improving resilience amongst HCPs. Abbreviated MBSR programmes were found to be as effective as the traditional 8-week MBSR programmes. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR is an effective intervention which can help improve the psychological functioning of HCPs. Recommendations include improving the overall quality of the studies by employing more robust controlled designs with randomisation, increased sample sizes with heterogeneous samples, and making active comparisons between interventions used.","output":"The Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on the Psychological Functioning of Healthcare Professionals: a Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two years have passed since the unprecedented breakout of the global pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, which began at the end of 2019 [...].","output":"Collective Knowledge Used to Unveil Cardiovascular Injury Emerged during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long before anyone had even heard of COVID-19, the World Health Organization had declared 2020 to be the Year of the Nurse and Midwife, an opportunity for society to recognize the critical role that these professions play in health care and the personal risks that they must take in order to fulfill their missions.

Potentially Preventable Hospitalisations (PPH) for physical health conditions are an indicator of health service access, integration and effectiveness, and are elevated in long term studies of people with MH conditions. We aimed to examine whether PPH rates were elevated in MH service users over a 12-month follow-up period more suitable for routine health indicator reporting. We also examined whether MH service users had increased PPH rates at a younger age, potentially reflecting the younger onset of chronic physical conditions. METHODS: A population-wide data linkage in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, population 7.8 million. PPH rates in 178 009 people using community MH services in 2016-2017 were compared to population rates. Primary outcomes were crude and age- and disadvantage-standardised annual PPH episode rate (episodes per 100 000 population), PPH day rate (hospital days per 100 000) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRR). RESULTS: MH service users had higher rates of PPH admission (AIRR 3.6, 95% CI 3.5-3.6) and a larger number of hospital days (AIRR 5.2, 95% CI 5.2-5.3) than other NSW residents due to increased likelihood of admission, more admissions per person and longer length of stay. Increases were greatest for vaccine-preventable conditions (AIRR 4.7, 95% CI 4.5-5.0), and chronic conditions (AIRR 3.7, 95% CI 3.6-3.7). The highest number of admissions and relative risks were for respiratory and metabolic conditions, including chronic obstructive airways disease (AIRR 5.8, 95% CI 5.5-6.0) and diabetic complications (AIRR 5.4, 95% CI 5.1-5.8). One-quarter of excess potentially preventable bed days in MH service users were due to vaccine-related conditions, including vaccine-preventable respiratory illness. Age-related increases in risk occurred earlier in MH service users, particularly for chronic and vaccine-preventable conditions. PPH rates in MH service users aged 20-29 were similar to population rates of people aged 60 and over. These substantial differences were not explained by socio-economic disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS: PPHs for physical health conditions are substantially increased in people with MH conditions. Short term (12-month) PPH rates may be a useful lead indicator of increased physical morbidity and less accessible, integrated or effective health care. High hospitalisation rates for vaccine-preventable respiratory infections and hepatitis underline the importance of vaccination in MH service users and suggests potential benefits of prioritising this group for COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Potentially preventable hospitalisations for physical health conditions in community mental health service users: a population-wide linkage study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As health care systems respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, new virtual care approaches are emerging for health promotion and chronic disease management.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from psychiatric professionals in 34 hospitals between 29 January and 7 February 2020, in China. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or deployed on wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals.

The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables. This research supports the policymakers with robust data for the informative allocation of scarce resources.","output":"Dynamics of the COVID-19 Contagion and Mortality: Country Factors, Social Media, and Market Response Evidence from a Global Panel Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To establish the evidence for rehabilitation interventions tested in populations of patients admitted to ICU and critical care with severe respiratory illness, and consider whether the evidence is generalizable to patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The authors undertook a rapid systematic review. Medline (via OvidSP), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCOhost), Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL (via Wiley), Epistemonikos (via Epistemonikos.org), PEDro (via pedro.org.au) and OTseeker (via otseeker.com) searched to 7 May 2020. The authors included systematic reviews, RCTs and qualitative studies involving adults with respiratory illness requiring intensive care who received rehabilitation to enhance or restore resulting physical impairments or function. Data were extracted by one author and checked by a second. TIDier was used to guide intervention descriptions. Study quality was assessed using Critical Skills Appraisal Programme (CASP) tools. RESULTS: Six thousand nine hundred and three titles and abstracts were screened; 24 systematic reviews, 11 RCTs and eight qualitative studies were included. Progressive exercise programmes, early mobilisation and multicomponent interventions delivered in ICU can improve functional independence. Nutritional supplementation in addition to rehabilitation in post-ICU hospital settings may improve performance of activities of daily living. The evidence for rehabilitation after discharge from hospital following an ICU admission is inconclusive. Those receiving rehabilitation valued it, engendering hope and confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise, early mobilisation and multicomponent programmes may improve recovery following ICU admission for severe respiratory illness that could be generalizable to those with COVID-19. Rehabilitation interventions can bring hope and confidence to individuals but there is a need for an individualised approach and the use of behaviour change strategies.

T cell responses to viruses can be corrected by adoptive cellular therapy using donor-derived virus-specific T cells. One approach is the establishment of banks of HLA-typed virus-specific T cells for rapid deployment to patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2Cexposed blood donations contain CD4 and CD8 memory T cells which recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and membrane antigens. Peptides of these antigens can be used to isolate virus-specific T cells in a GMP-compliant process. The isolated T cells can be rapidly expanded using GMP-compliant reagents for use as an allogeneic therapy. Memory and effector phenotypes are present in the selected virus-specific T cells, but our method rapidly expands the desirable central memory phenotype. A manufacturing yield ranging from 10(10) to 10(11) T cells can be obtained within 21 days culture.

Therapies based on the Shenghuang Granule have proved helpful in viral infection and septic shock. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the traditional Chinese medicine, Shenhuang Granule, with standard care in hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. At 4 medical centers, a total of 111 severe/critical patients were randomly assigned to receive Shenhuang Granule (SHG group) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or to receive standard care alone (Control group). The maximal follow up time was 75 days. The clinical endpoint was clinical improvement and mortality. RESULTS: 54 patients were assigned to the control group and 57 to the SHG group. The overall mortality was 75.9% (41/54) in the control group, and 38.6% (22/57) in the SHG group (p<0.01 vs control). The post hoc analysis showed that in the severe category, the mortality of the control group vs. the SHG group was 58.8% (10/17) vs 5.3% (1/19) (p<0.01); while in the critical category, it was 83.8% (31/37) vs. 55.3% (21/38) (p<0.05). In the severe category, the mortality of patients who eventually received an invasive ventilator in the control vs. the SHG group was 58.8% (10/17) vs. 0 (0/19) (p<0.01). Administration of SHG was associated with increased lymphocytes and decreased adverse events.

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level during the first seven weeks of the outbreak in the United States. We estimate the association between stay-at-home orders and alterations in COVID-19 cases and fatalities using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) average reduction in weekly incident cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) average reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks.

Several observational studies have used ecological (population-level) data to assess the effect of masks on transmission, hospitalization, and mortality at the region or community level. METHODS: We undertook this systematic review to summarize the study designs, outcomes, and key quality indicators of using ecological data to evaluate the association between mask wearing and COVID-19 outcomes. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 global literature database up to 5 March 2021 for studies reporting the impact of mask use in community settings on outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission using ecological data. FINDINGS: Twenty one articles were identified that analysed ecological data to assess the protective effect of policies mandating community mask wearing. All studies reported SARS-CoV-2 benefits in terms of reductions in either the incidence, hospitalization, or mortality, or a combination of these outcomes. Few studies assessed compliance to mask wearing policies or controlled for the possible influence of other preventive measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, and information about compliance to these policies was lacking. INTERPRETATION: Ecological studies have been cited as evidence to advocate for the adoption of universal masking policies. The studies summarized by this review suggest that community mask policies may reduce the population-level burden of SARS-CoV-2. Methodological limitations, in particular controlling for the actual practice of mask wearing and other preventive policies make it difficult to determine causality. There are several important limitations to consider for improving the validity of ecological data.","output":"Mask use in community settings in the context of COVID-19: A systematic review of ecological data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital, but delicious!

In recent years, growing evidence has implicated the gut environment and the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, especially in a subset of people who exhibit prodromal gastrointestinal dysfunction. Specifically, perturbations of gut homeostasis are hypothesized to contribute to -synuclein aggregation in enteric neurons, which may spread to the brain over decades and eventually result in the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of PD, including neurodegeneration and motor impairments. However, the mechanisms linking gut disturbances and -synuclein aggregation are still unclear. A plethora of research indicates that toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, are critical mediators of gut homeostasis. Alongside their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, studies are increasingly demonstrating that TLR2 and TLR4 signalling shapes the development and function of the gut and the enteric nervous system. Notably, TLR2 and TLR4 are dysregulated in patients with PD, and may thus be central to early gut dysfunction in PD. To better understand the putative contribution of intestinal TLR2 and TLR4 dysfunction to early -synuclein aggregation and PD, we critically discuss the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in normal gut function as well as evidence for altered TLR2 and TLR4 signalling in PD, by reviewing clinical, animal model and in vitro research. Growing evidence on the immunological aetiology of -synuclein aggregation is also discussed, with a focus on the interactions of -synuclein with TLR2 and TLR4. We propose a conceptual model of PD pathogenesis in which microbial dysbiosis alters the permeability of the intestinal barrier as well as TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, ultimately leading to a positive feedback loop of chronic gut dysfunction promoting -synuclein aggregation in enteric and vagal neurons. In turn, -synuclein aggregates may then migrate to the brain via peripheral nerves, such as the vagal nerve, to contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typically associated with PD.","output":"TLR2 and TLR4 in Parkinsons disease pathogenesis: the environment takes a toll on the gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Digital health technologies are poised to revolutionise the healthcare industry by improving accessibility to services and patient outcomes.

We sought to characterize the changes in testing accessibility at UCCs between March and August 2020 on the basis of testing availability (including rapid antigen testing), wait time for test results, cost of visits, and cost of tests. METHODS: Data were collected using a secret shopper methodology. Researchers contacted 250 UCCs in 10 states. Investigators used a standardized script to survey centers on their COVID-19 testing availability and policies. UCCs were initially contacted in March and re-called in August. T-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify differences between March and August data and differences by center classification. RESULTS: Our results indicate that both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect COVID-19 genetic material and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests have increased in availability. However, wait times for PCR test results have significantly increased to an average of 5.79 days. Additionally, a high proportion of UCCs continue to charge for tests and visits and no significant decrease was found in the proportion of UCCs that charge for COVID-19 testing from March to August. Further, no state reported a majority of UCCs with rapid testing available, indicating an overall lack of rapid testing. CONCLUSIONS: From March to August, COVID-19 testing availability gradually improved. However, many barriers lie in access to COVID-19 testing, including testing costs, visit costs, and overall lack of availability of rapid testing in the majority of UCCs.

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with the implemented system of reopening in phases. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social distancing. We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered to the population.","output":"Data-driven optimized control of the COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as both a necessary and significant tool in the provision of safe and timely healthcare in the field of otolaryngology.

The surveillance patients had significantly earlier stage tumors (P < .0001) and were more likely to undergo endoscopic therapy and to keep their esophagus (44% vs 11%, P < .0001) than were patients with prevalent disease. Furthermore, the patients in the surveillance group were less likely to have lymph node metastases and had better overall and disease-free survival. No patient with high-grade dysplasia or an intramucosal tumor died of cancer. CONCLUSIONS Patients within a surveillance program for Barrett's esophagus had better survival and were less likely to have an esophagectomy than those who presented with prevalent disease. Treatment of intramucosal cancer was curative, and improved survival with surveillance was not secondary to lead time bias. Surveillance endoscopy remains important in patients with Barrett's esophagus.","output":"Effect of Barrett's esophagus surveillance on esophageal preservation, tumor stage, and survival with esophageal adenocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells outcomes important to patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.","output":"CT quantification of pneumonia lesions in early days predicts progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Approximately 35% to 60% of all patients with head and neck cancer are malnourished at the time of their diagnosis because of tumor burden and obstruction of intake or the anorexia and cachexia associated with their cancer. The purpose of this article is to provide a contemporary review of the nutritional aspects of care for patients with head and neck cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature search was performed in Medline, Cochrane, and other available databases from 1990 through 2012 for the clinical effectiveness of nutritional support, treatment modalities, and methods of delivery in relation to patients with head and neck malignancies. Human studies published in English and having nutritional status and head and neck cancer as a predictor variable were included. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective clinical studies, and systemic reviews were selected based on their relevance to the abovementioned subtitles. The resultant articles were analyzed and summarized into the definition, impact, assessment, treatment, and modes of administration of nutrition on the outcome of patients with head and neck cancer. RESULTS Articles were reviewed that focused on the etiology and assessment of malnutrition and current nutritional treatments for cancer-induced anorexia and cachexia. Two hundred forty-eight articles were found: 2 clinical trials, 10 meta-analyses, 210 review studies, and 26 systematic reviews. Because of the lack of prospective data, a summative review of the conclusions of the studies is presented. CONCLUSION Nutritional interventions should be initiated before cancer treatment begins and these interventions need to be ongoing after completion of treatment to ensure optimal outcomes for patients. A nutritional assessment must be part of all comprehensive treatment plans for patients with head and neck cancer. Alternative medical interventions, such as immune-enhancing nutrients or anticytokine pharmaceutical agents, also may be effective as adjuvant therapies, but more research is needed to quantify their clinical effect.","output":"Nutritional considerations for head and neck cancer patients: a review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The pandemic crisis has resulted in global chaos that had caused massive disruption to the supply chain. The pharmaceutical industry, in particular, has been working tirelessly to ensure that they can cater to the people who need them.

For this purpose, Luhmanns theory will specifically be compared with Emile Durkheims and Alfred Schutzs sociological theories. Durkheim, a child of the Enlightenment, considered freedom a collective ideal of moral individualism and conceived that the rational state realizes freedom by spreading the civil-religious human ideal for modern social order. In contrast, Schutz, following Henri Bergson, who criticized rationality for spatially fixing inner time, regarded freedom as a given in the individuals underlying duration, not as a shared ideal. Yet, unlike Bergson, he continued relying on rationalism, and he thought that the sociological observer observes how something appears to people with the epoch of natural attitude, not what it objectively is. Inheriting this phenomenological subjectivism, Luhmann showed that the self-referentiality of consciousness also applies to society: A social system, which path-dependently emerges itself from a double contingency, observes the world in its own way based on its self-referentially constituted eigen-time. On account of this system closure, and contrary to Durkheims illuminist belief, there is no controlling entity in a highly evolved society, where freedom results from the enlarged, diversified possibilities of living experience and action (contingency). Thus, sociological enlightenment doubts self-evidence so that society brackets the taken-for-granted social order or social reality and amplifies individuals deviations to evolve toward freedom.","output":"How Society Changes: Sociological Enlightenment and a Theory of Social Evolution for Freedom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is widespread concern about treatment of psoriasis in COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment features of the psoriasis patients during the pandemic period. We conducted a study in dermatology clinics of seven different tertiary centers. All adult psoriasis patients who were followed up between 11 March 2020 and 28 June 2020, were phone called or questioned in their visit to their follow-up clinics. A semistructured questionnaire was applied and patients' demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. Of 1322 patients, 52.4% were male, and 47.6% were female. According to the questionnaire responses, 964 (72.9%) of these patients could not communicate with their physician during this period, remained 358 (27.1%) patients contacted the physician by phone, email, or hospital visit. From the patients diagnosed as probable/confirmed COVID-19, 14 were female, and 9 were male. Nine of 23 (39.1%) patients were using biologic treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hospitalization from COVID-19 between the patients using biologics (n = 9) and those who did not (n = 14) (P = 1.00). No mortality was observed among them. Obesity, smoking, age, and accompanying psoriatic arthritis were not among the risk factors affecting the frequency of COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recommendations and policies from government and national health organizations, combined with social distancing, have led to exponential increases in telemedicine use. Teleophthalmology can be integrated into ophthalmic care delivery. In the emergency room, teleophthalmology can be utilized to triage patients and diagnose common ophthalmic eye diseases. Ophthalmology practices can utilize real-time medicine to conduct many parts of an in-person exam. In cases where more complex diagnostic tools are warranted, a model incorporating telemedicine and focused in-person visits may still be beneficial. Innovative technologies emerging in the market allow for increased remote monitoring, screening, and management of adult and pediatric patients for common eye diseases. SUMMARY: COVID-19 created a demand for healthcare delivery that limits in-person examination and potential viral exposure. Teleophthalmology allows ophthalmologists to continue caring for patients while keeping physicians and patients safe. Although challenges still exist, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of teleophthalmology. As a result, teleophthalmology will play an integral role in providing high-quality efficient care in the near future.","output":"Teleophthalmology: an essential tool in the era of the novel coronavirus 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence about the association between volunteering and the mental health of older adults during COVID-19 remains underexplored. This study investigated (1) patterns of volunteering among older adults in Hong Kong during COVID-19; (2) associations between volunteering and mental health of older adults during COVID-19; and (3) associations between key psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem) and volunteering among older adults during COVID-19. This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19. Our study suggested that encouraging older adults to volunteer during the pandemic is a key pathway to maintain mental health.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, observational, quantitative study. METHODS: In total, 215 frontline nurses working at 12 hospitals across Jazan, Saudi Arabia, were recruited. Data were collected during August 2020 using a modified version of the severe acute respiratory syndrome team questionnaire. RESULTS: Roughly two-thirds (62.3%) of the participants reported moderate to high levels of nervousness and fear at work. Ethical and moral responsibility has been determined as the main motivator for frontline nurses to practice their profession, with 88% of them expressing a willingness to work even if the situation deteriorated further. However, 87% of the participants were extremely concerned about transmitting the disease to their family members. The most common coping strategy adopted by the nurses appeared to be adherence to strict protective measures (93.5%), followed by the acquisition of more knowledge about the disease (82.3%). CONCLUSION: Frontline nurses experience severe psychological stress, which is mainly caused by their fear of contracting the infection or passing it on to their family members.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed from January 23, 2020 to February 19, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: severe group (n = 23) and non-severe group (n = 61). Clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and CT findings on admission were analyzed. CT quantitative parameters, including GGO, consolidation, total lesion score, percentage GGO, and percentage consolidation (both relative to total lesion volume) were calculated. Relationships between the CT findings and laboratory data were estimated. Finally, a discrimination model was established to assess the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients in the severe group had higher baseline neutrophil percentage, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin levels, and lower baseline lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage (p < 0.001). The severe group also had higher GGO score (p < 0.001), consolidation score (p < 0.001), total lesion score (p < 0.001), and percentage consolidation (p = 0.002), but had a lower percentage GGO (p = 0.008). These CT quantitative parameters were significantly correlated with laboratory inflammatory marker levels, including neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, hs-CRP level, and procalcitonin level (p < 0.05). The total lesion score demonstrated the best performance when the data cut-off was 8.2%. Furthermore, the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 93.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 86.8C100%), 91.3% (CI: 69.6C100%), and 91.8% (CI: 23.0C98.4%), respectively.

An increasing number of cases and deaths are challenging the health-care system globally. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 disease among health personnel in rapid outbreak in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using Google Forms through Google platform on-line. A total of 713 health personal allied health-care staff, working in different public and private health-care facilities, was conducted in the mid of April 2020. A structured knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire used to assess health personnel's knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19. All instruments were validated and pretested before use. Chi-square test, followed by binary logistic and multivariate regression, was applied to determine factors associated with knowledge scores. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirteen health personnel participated, and 703 (98.6%) participants responded were analyzed for final results. 95.9% of the health personnel were aware about route of transmission and clinical symptoms (95.3%) of COVID-19. 63.7% believed that virus outbreak would be controlled globally and followed standard precautions (81.8%), including wearing the mask. Further, majority (98.3%) of the participants avoided social contact by not going to crowded places and not calling people to their homes (82.2%) during the advisory of the government. In binary logistic regression analyses, the adequate knowledge score found significantly associated with MBBS/bachelor's degree (odds ratio [OR]: 2.309, confidence interval [CI]: 1.232C4.324, P < 0.009) and master's degree (OR: 2.944, CI: 1.485C5.835, P < 0.002), working with government health-care facility (OR: 3.662, CI: 1.624C8.285, P < 0.002), and holding a post of a physician (OR: 7.735, CI: 2.210C27.091, P < 0.001) during outbreak.

Participatory disease surveillance mechanisms have already been adopted in countries for the current pandemic. India, with scarce resources, good telecom support, and a not-so-robust heath care system, makes a strong case for introducing participatory disease surveillance for the prevention and control of the pandemic. India has just launched Aarogya Setu, which is a first-of-its-kind participatory disease surveillance initiative in India. This will supplement the existing Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme in India by finding missing cases and having faster aggregation, analysis of data, and prompt response measures.

In addition, the costs and cost-effectiveness of the four surveillance strategies will be assessed. Further, this trial is supplemented by a qualitative component to determine the acceptability of each strategy. Findings will inform the choice of the most effective, acceptable and affordable strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, with the most effective and cost-effective strategy becoming part of the local public health department's current routine health surveillance activities. Investigating its everyday performance will allow us to examine the strategy's applicability to real time prevalence prediction and the usefulness of the resulting information for local policy makers to implement countermeasures that effectively prevent future nationwide lockdowns. The authors would like to emphasize the importance and relevance of this study and its expected findings in the context of population-based disease surveillance, especially in respect to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In Germany, but also in many other countries, COVID-19 surveillance has so far largely relied on passive surveillance strategies that identify individuals with clinical symptoms, monitor those cases who then tested positive for the virus, followed by tracing of individuals in close contact to those positive cases. To achieve higher effectiveness in population surveillance and to reliably predict the course of an outbreak, screening and monitoring of infected individuals without major symptoms (about 40% of the population) will be necessary. While current testing capacities are also used to identify such asymptomatic cases, this rather passive approach is not suitable in generating reliable population-based estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers to allow any dependable predictions on the course of the pandemic. To better control and manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, current strategies therefore need to be complemented by an active surveillance of the wider population, i.e. routinely conducted testing and monitoring activities to identify and isolate infected individuals regardless of their clinical symptoms. Such active surveillance strategies will enable more effective prevention of the spread of the virus as they can generate more precise population-based parameters during a pandemic. This essential information will be required in order to determine the best strategic and targeted short-term countermeasures to limit infection spread locally. TRIAL DESIGN: This trial implements a cluster-randomised, two-factorial controlled, prospective, interventional, single-blinded design with four study arms, each representing a different SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance strategy. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible are individuals age 7 years or older living in Germany's Rhein-Neckar Region who consent to provide a saliva sample (all four arms) after completion of a brief questionnaire (two arms only). For the qualitative component, different samples of study participants and non-participants (i.e. eligible for study, but refuse to participate) will be identified for additional interviews. For these interviews, only individuals age 18 years or older are eligible. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Of the four surveillance strategies to be assessed and compared, Strategy A1 is considered the gold standard for prevalence estimation and used to determine bias in other arms. To determine the cost-effectiveness, each strategy is compared to status quo, defined as the currently practiced passive surveillance approach. Strategy A1: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). Strategy A2: Individuals (one per household) receive information and study material by mail with instructions on how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B1: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms and risk exposures. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions on how to produce a saliva sample and how to return the sample by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the saliva sample is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. Strategy B2: Individuals (one per household) receive information by mail on how to complete a brief pre-screening questionnaire which asks about COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. Only individuals whose pre-screening score crosses a defined threshold, will then receive additional study material by mail with instructions how to produce their own as well as saliva samples from each household member and how to return these samples by mail. Once received by the laboratory, the samples are tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-LAMP. In each strategy, RT-LAMP positive samples are additionally analyzed with qPCR in order to minimize the number of false positives. MAIN OUTCOMES: The identification of the one best strategy will be determined by a set of parameters. Primary outcomes include costs per correctly screened person, costs per positive case, positive detection rate, and precision of positive detection rate. Secondary outcomes include participation rate, costs per asymptomatic case, prevalence estimates, number of asymptomatic cases per study arm, ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases per study arm, participant satisfaction. Additional study components (not part of the trial) include cost effectiveness of each of the four surveillance strategies compared to passive monitoring (i.e. status quo), development of a prognostic model to predict hospital utilization caused by SARS-CoV-2, time from test shipment to test application and time from test shipment to test result, and perception and preferences of the persons to be tested with regard to test strategies. RANDOMISATION: Samples are drawn in three batches of three continuous weeks. Randomisation follows a two-stage process. First, a total of 220 sampling points have been allocated to the three different batches. To obtain an integer solution, the Cox-algorithm for controlled rounding has been used. Afterwards, sample points have been drawn separately per batch, following a probability proportional to size (PPS) random sample. Second, for each cluster the same number of residential addresses is randomly sampled from the municipal registries (self-weighted sample of individuals). The 28,125 addresses drawn per municipality are then randomly allocated to the four study arms A1, A2, B1, and B2 in the ratio 5 to 2.5 to 14 to 7 based on the expected response rates in each arm and the sensitivity and specificity of the pre-screening tool as applied in strategy B1 and B2. Based on the assumptions, this allocation should yield 2500 saliva samples in each strategy. Although a municipality can be sampled by multiple batches and the overall number of addresses per municipality might vary, the number of addresses contacted in each arm is kept constant. BLINDING (MASKING): The design is single-blinded, meaning the staff conducting the SARS-CoV-2 tests are unaware of the study arm assignment of each single participant and test sample. SAMPLE SIZES: Total sample size for the trial is 10,000 saliva samples equally allocated to the four study arms (i.e. 2,500 participants per arm). For the qualitative component, up to 60 in-depth interviews will be conducted with about 30 study participants (up to 15 in each arm A and B) and 30 participation refusers (up to 15 in each arm A and B) purposefully selected from the quantitative study sample to represent a variety of gender and ages to explore experiences with admission or rejection of study participation. Up to 25 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive study participants will be purposefully selected to explore the way in which asymptomatic men and women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 give meaning to their diagnosis and to the dialectic between feeling concurrently healthy and yet also being at risk for transmitting COVID-19. In addition, 100 randomly selected study participants will be included to explore participants' perspective on testing processes and implementation.

Most approaches target co-stimulatory pathways or the inhibition of immunosuppressive mechanisms, to enhance immune response and overcome the immune tolerance of tumors. Here, we propose a novel platform to deliver targeted immunomodulatory signaling, enhancing antitumor response. The platform is based on virus-like particles derived from lentiviral capsids. These particles may be engineered to harbor multifunctional ligands on the surface that drive tropism to the tumor site and deliver immunomodulatory signaling, boosting the antitumor response. We generated virus-like particles harboring a PSMA-ligand, TNFSF co-stimulatory ligands 4-1BBL or OX40L, and a membrane-anchored GM-CSF cytokine. The virus-like particles are driven to PSMA-expressing tumors and deliver immunomodulatory signaling from the TNFSF surface ligands and the anchored GM-CSF, inducing T cell proliferation, inhibition of regulatory T cells, and potentiating elimination of tumor cells. The PSMA-targeted particles harboring immunomodulators enhanced antitumor activity in immunocompetent challenged mice and may be explored as a potential tool for cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Boosting antitumor response with PSMA-targeted immunomodulatory VLPs, harboring costimulatory TNFSF ligands and GM-CSF cytokine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver disorders have been increasing globally in recent years.

However, studies on sub-Saharan Africa are rare. For BaKongo cemeteries, it is only known that they traditionally do not exhibit plants for decoration purposes. Our study wanted to inspect the influence of Portuguese culture due to the long shared colonial past. METHODS During 2015 and 2019, plant use in 87 graveyards in 13 municipalities of the province Uge was documented. Five expert interviews with the village eldest in five municipalities completed the data collection. RESULTS While 24% of the graveyards didnt have any planting, 27 plant species were found in the remaining ones, including a high percentage of alien species (59%), mainly from the Americas. The most abundant plant species are Euphorbia tirucalli (23%) and Agave sisalana (22%). With increasing distance from the city Uge (especially towards the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the utilization of living plants in cemeteries is decreasing except along the road. In most of the cases, just one plant species per gravesite was found. CONCLUSIONS This unexpected high number of plants might be interpreted as a strong evidence of outside influence.

Here, we report that the C-type lectin receptor L-SIGN interacted in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with high-mannoseCtype N-glycans on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that L-SIGN was highly expressed on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and lymph node lymphatic endothelial cells but not on blood endothelial cells. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins within the LSECs from liver autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19. We found that both pseudo-typed virus enveloped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infected L-SIGNCexpressing cells relative to control cells. Moreover, blocking L-SIGN function reduced CoV-2Ctype infection. These results indicate that L-SIGN is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. LSECs are major sources of the clotting factors vWF and factor VIII (FVIII). LSECs from liver autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 expressed substantially higher levels of vWF and FVIII than LSECs from uninfected liver samples.

In this paper we introduce the Compositional Agile System (CAS), an environment created to support iAgile and automate some of its tasks using OSS tools. iAgile is a Scrum-like model designed to develop critical systems in the military domain .","output":"An Open Source Environment for an Agile Development Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) incidence has risen sharply in Western countries over recent decades. Local and systemic inflammation is considered an important contributor to OA pathogenesis. Established risk factors for OA and its precursor, Barrett's oesophagus (BE), include symptomatic reflux, obesity and smoking. The role of inherited genetic susceptibility remains an area of active investigation. Here, we explore whether germline variation related to inflammatory processes influences susceptibility to BE/OA. DESIGN We used data from a genomewide association study of 2515 OA cases, 3295 BE cases and 3207 controls. Our analysis included 7863 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 449 genes assigned to five pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), cytokine signalling, oxidative stress, human leucocyte antigen and nuclear factor-B. A principal components-based analytic framework was employed to evaluate pathway-level and gene-level associations with disease risk. RESULTS We identified a significant signal for the COX pathway in relation to BE risk (p=0.0059, false discovery rate q=0.03), and in gene-level analyses found an association with microsomal glutathione-S-transferase 1 (MGST1); (p=0.0005, q=0.005). Assessment of 36 MGST1 SNPs identified 14 variants associated with elevated BE risk (q<0.05). Four of these were subsequently confirmed (p<5.510-5) in a meta-analysis encompassing an independent set of 1851 BE cases and 3496 controls, and are known strong expression quantitative trait loci for MGST1. Three such variants were associated with similar elevations in OA risk. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation of inflammation-related germline variation in relation to risk of BE/OA and suggests that variants in MGST1 influence disease susceptibility.","output":"Germline variation in inflammation-related pathways and risk of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CALMing strategies during COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This is a retrospective epidemiological study of adult patients with hMPV severe CAP admitted to ICU during a ten-year period with admission PSI score  3. RESULTS: The 92.8% of the 28 patients with severe CAP due to human metapneumovirus were detected during the first half of the year. Median age was 62 years and 60.7% were male. The genotyping of isolated human metapneumovirus showed group B predominance (60.7%). All patients had acute respiratory failure. Median APACHE II and SOFA score were 13 and 6.55, respectively. The 25% were coinfected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. 60.7% of the patients had shock at admission and 50% underwent mechanical ventilation. Seven patients developed ARDS, three of them younger than 60 years and without comorbidities. Mortality in ICU was 14.3%. Among survivors, ICU and hospital stay were 6.5 and 14 days, respectively. Plasma levels of procalcitonin were higher in patients with bacterial coinfection (18.2 vs 0.54; p < 0.05). The levels of C-reactive protein, however, were similar. CONCLUSION: Human metapneumovirus was associated with severe CAP requiring ICU admission among elderly patients or patients with comorbidities, but also in healthy young subjects. These patients often underwent mechanical ventilation with elevated health resource consumption. While one out of four patients showed pneumococcal coinfection, plasma procalcitonin helped to implement antimicrobial stewardship.

The second and third waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are ongoing. The universities of most countries of the world are closed to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many universities of the globe stopped direct classroom teaching, and some started online teaching to minimise the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on education. In this manuscript, an attempt has undertaken to analyse the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on global veterinary medical education. We have conducted a literature search in different databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using different keywords to find out peer-reviewed scientific articles about the impact of COVID-19 on veterinary medical education. The literature search generated 17 eligible scientific papers for qualitative analysis of the effect of COVID-19 on veterinary medical education. The COVID-19 pandemic has a severe adverse influence on veterinary medical education. Shifting from direct classroom teaching to online teaching is one of the sweeping impacts. It might be possible to conduct online classes for veterinary medical education. But the supply of electronic devices, motivation to students in self-learning, institutional support etc., are crucial for interactive situated learning of veterinary courses. Research and development of sustainable, worthwhile methods for remote teaching veterinary medical students are essential.

In this study, we examined anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic in a large sample of pregnant individuals (n=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3-months of age to examine whether this prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain changes. We found significantly elevated prenatal maternal distress compared to pre-pandemic rates, with 47% and 33% of participants reporting clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Importantly, we identified social support as a protective factor for clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress. We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates this relationship. Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a protective factor not just for pregnant individuals, but also for their developing infants.

This means that inhibition of galectin-3 may become a new strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated new approach for finding lead compounds that inhibit galectin-3, by combining universal artificial intelligence algorithms with traditional drug screening methods. Based on molecular docking method, potential compounds with high binding affinity were screened out from Chinese medicine database. Manifold artificial intelligence algorithms were performed to validate the docking results and further screen compounds. Among all involved predictive methods, the deep learning-based algorithm made 500 modeling attempts, and the square correlation coefficient of the best trained model on the test sets was 0.9. The XGBoost model reached a square correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a mean square error of only 0.01. We switched to the ZINC database and performed the same experiment, the results showed that the compounds in the former database showed stronger affinity. Finally, we further verified through molecular dynamics simulation that the complex composed of the candidate ligand and the target protein showed stable binding within 100 ns of simulation time. In summary, combined with the application based on artificial intelligence algorithms, we unearthed the active ingredients 1,2-Dimethylbenzene and Typhic acid contained in Crataegus pinnatifida and Typha angustata might be the effective inhibitors of neurodegenerative diseases.

Using extensive numerical simulations and based on our analytical results we conclude that (ceteris paribus) the elongation of the plot or field in which the nodes are distributed makes the network more resilient to the propagation of a disease due to the fact that the epidemic threshold increases with the elongation of the rectangle.

METHODS: We studied two cohorts; the first was composed of respondents from a cross\\\\sectional parental survey of children with PRDs contacted through patient support groups and social media platforms, and the second cohort was composed of participants from the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) legacy clinical registry. RESULTS: In the social media cohort, 712 complete surveys were analyzed. Most (65.9%) were referred from Facebook. The most common rheumatic disease was juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (27.1%), followed by juvenile dermatomyositis (22.1%). In the CARRA registry cohort, 7985 records were included. JIA was the largest disease group (70.3%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (12.0%). The age at disease onset for most PRDs was similar between those in the social media and CARRA registry cohorts (mean difference = 1.3 years). CONCLUSION: Recruitment through Facebook was the most fruitful. The clinical characteristics of the social media cohort were similar to those of patients recruited through a clinical registry, suggesting the utility of online recruitment for engaging disease\\\\relevant cohorts.

A disproportionately higher number of African Americans are afflicted with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity), and SARS-CoV-2 has helped expose these health disparities. Several factors including socioeconomic status, inferior health care, and work circumstances contribute to these disparities. Identifying potential inflammatory biomarkers and decreasing basal levels in high-risk individuals with comorbidities through preventive measures is critical. Immune cells, particularly neutrophils, protect us against pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) through increased generation of free radicals or oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that ensnare pathogens, killing them extracellularly. However, continued generation of NETs coupled with the lack of prompt removal pose danger to host cells. NET levels are increased during pro-inflammatory diseases. COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated NET levels, depending upon disease severity. Conceivably, high-risk individuals with elevated basal NET levels would exhibit hyper-inflammation when infected with SARS-CoV-2, amplifying disease severity and deaths. Drugs inhibiting oxidant formation and vitamin supplements decreased NET formation in mice models of inflammation. Thus, it is conceivable that preventive treatments lowering NET levels and inflammation in high-risk individuals could mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","output":"Do free radical NETwork and oxidative stress disparities in African Americans enhance their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter summarises the detailed findings of the United Nations Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty and exemplifies the significant leading role of academia in making the invisible and forgotten visible throughout the world.

Here, we review immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the development of COVID-19. We explore how underlying disease etiologies and common therapies used to treat these conditions exacerbate COVID-19 progression. Moreover, we discuss the long-term challenges associated with the use of both novel and repurposed therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing comorbidities.","output":"The Impact of Pre-existing Comorbidities and Therapeutic Interventions on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 is declared as a world emergency and it is widespread in countries and territories which affected around 91% students worldwide that they are unable to attend their educational institutions physically where the numbers are unprecedented and implications are massive The continuity in teaching and learning while ensuring the protection and safety of students and staff, brought new challenges in this epidemic Institutes around the globe started online education and students were motivated to become part of E-Learning through educational information systems This study is investigating the impact of online teaching, educational information systems, learning outcomes from students' perspective By using the user Centered Design methodology, around two hundred students and 30 faculty members from five different countries of Europe and Asia were involved in this research Their feedback was taken through questionnaires, interviews and focus group methods A comprehensive questionnaire, containing six different questions regarding understanding about educational information systems and another six questions related to students-instructor interaction, were asked from students The instructors were interviewed about their previous exposure or training for designing online courses The results showed that students' satisfaction on online teaching varied country wise while course objectives are not being fulfilled as per their perception The students showed their concern that online activities are not much engaging, showed less satisfaction in lab work while in some cases felt stressed, overburdened and they found insufficient technical support being offered by their institute The study is unique as it covered vast factors impacting online teaching and the results provide guidelines for all stakeholders, policy makers, educators and management ? 2020 ACM","output":"Usability Analysis of Educational Information Systems from Student's Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate risk factors associated with unfavourable outcomes: emergency care, hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death in patients with immune-mediated rheumatic disease (IMRD) and COVID-19.

Patients with IMRD and COVID-19 according to the Ministry of Health criteria were classified as eligible for the study. RESULTS: 334 participants were enrolled, a majority of them women, with a median age of 45 years; systemic lupus erythematosus (32.9%) was the most frequent IMRD. Emergency care was required in 160 patients, 33.0% were hospitalised, 15.0% were admitted to the ICU and 10.5% underwent mechanical ventilation; 28 patients (8.4%) died. In the multivariate adjustment model for emergency care, diabetes (prevalence ratio, PR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73; p=0.004), kidney disease (PR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.77; p=0.020), oral glucocorticoids (GC) (PR 1.49; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.85; p<0.001) and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (PR 1.38; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.67; p=0.001) remained significant; for hospitalisation, age >50 years (PR 1.89; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.85; p=0.002), no use of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) (PR 2.51;95% CI 1.16 to 5.45; p=0.004) and methylprednisolone pulse therapy (PR 2.50; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.92; p<0.001); for ICU admission, oral GC (PR 2.24; 95% CI 1.36 to 3.71; p<0.001) and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (PR 1.65; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.68; p<0.043); the two variables associated with death were pulse therapy with methylprednisolone or cyclophosphamide (PR 2.86; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.14; p<0.018).

Using data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), we examined how older adults may have changed their frequency of contact with others via various modes (i.e., in-person, phone calls, messages, and video calls) since the pandemic started, and how these choices may be impacting their mental health. From September 2020 through January 2021, NSHAP respondents (N=2,554 age 50-94 with data from 2015-16) completed a survey via web, phone, or paper-and-pencil. Although some older adults reported reducing their in-person contact with out-of-household family (38%) and friends (40%) since the pandemic started, some also increased contact with them via remote modes such as phone calls (25% and 16% with family and friends respectively); emails, texts, or social media messages (26 and 21%); and video calls (24 and 18%).

We modified the circuit to include a heated expiratory filter, eliminating the need for daily filter changes due to buildup of condensate. The purpose of the study was to determine if substitution of the filter resulted in a clinically important change in delivered tidal volume or amplitude. We additionally compared expiratory resistance and measured efficacy for the substituted filter. METHODS This bench study measured tidal volume and amplitude using 5 of each filter type across 6 patient setting scenarios. Filter efficacy was tested through an independent laboratory, and expiratory resistance measurements were taken after prolonged use with humidification. RESULTS The clinically important threshold value for tidal volume (defined as 5% difference) was excluded by the limits of agreement, confirming that use of the modified circuit does not result in alterations in tidal volume. The clinically important threshold for amplitude (defined as 10% difference) was the same as the lower confidence interval on the lower limit of agreement, indicating it is possible for amplitude values to be different between the 2 filters. Filter efficacy for the substituted filter was not affected. Expiratory resistance was unchanged in the substituted filter, but nearly doubled for the manufacturer's filter after 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Modifying the circuit to include a heated expiratory filter does not affect tidal volume, and the filter material remains efficacious during oscillation. Amplitude varies under some conditions. Preventing the need for daily filter changes reduces the risk of alveolar de-recruitment. This does not completely eliminate exposure to expired gases, but provides an additional layer of protection against occupational exposure and nosocomial spread of respiratory pathogens. Further testing in a clinical environment is necessary.","output":"Modification of a high frequency oscillator circuit with a heated expiratory filter to prevent infectious pathogen transmission: a bench study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In humans, sleep regulation is tightly linked to social times that assign local time to events, such as school, work, or meals. The impact of these social times, collectively-social time pressure, on sleep has been studied epidemiologically via quantification of the discrepancy between sleep times on workdays and those on work-free days. This discrepancy is known as the social jetlag (SJL). COVID-19-mandated social restrictions (SR) constituted a global intervention by affecting social times worldwide. We launched a Global Chrono Corona Survey (GCCS) that queried sleep-wake times before and during SR (preSR and inSR). 11,431 adults from 40 countries responded between April 4 and May 6, 2020. The final sample consisted of 7517 respondents (68.2% females), who had been 32.7  9.1 (mean  sd) days under SR. SR led to robust changes: mid-sleep time on workdays and free days was delayed by 50 and 22 min, respectively; sleep duration increased on workdays by 26 min but shortened by 9 min on free days; SJL decreased by ~ 30 min. On workdays inSR, sleep-wake times in most people approached those of their preSR free days. Changes in sleep duration and SJL correlated with inSR-use of alarm clocks and were larger in young adults. The data indicate a massive sleep deficit under pre-pandemic social time pressure, provide insights to the actual sleep need of different age-groups and suggest that tolerable SJL is about 20 min.

Telemedicine has been proposed to improve access. Introduction: The objective of this study was to identify predictors of telemedicine use for chronic disease specialty care in the Alaska Tribal Health System (ATHS) in the setting of usual care. Materials and Methods: We utilized data from the electronic health record (EHR) of patients from four regions in the ATHS. We queried the EHR to identify cases (ever users of telemedicine) and controls (never users), both of whom had chronic diseases requiring specialty care. Data were collected from 2015 through mid-2019. Results: We included 3,075 patients (799 ever users and 2,276 never users). In univariate analysis, ever users were older, more likely to be male, had more chronic conditions and higher encounter rates. There were differences by region, community, and type of specialty clinic. In our simple multivariate model, factors associated with telemedicine use included age, male gender, region, and outpatient visit rate per year. Having at least one cardiology clinic visit was also associated with telemedicine use, with the highest estimated odds ratio (5.27, p < 0.01). Discussion: This study describes factors associated with telemedicine use in the ATHS before the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate monitoring changes in these predictors over time, as we expect them to evolve. Conclusions: We found among factors associated with telemedicine use were age, gender, region, outpatient visit rate, and visits to a specific specialty clinic.","output":"Factors Associated with Telemedicine Use for Chronic Disease Specialty Care in the Alaska Tribal Health System, 2015-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Pain is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms in cancer patients. A clinical peculiarity of cancer pain is the breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), which is defined as a temporary exacerbation of pain that breaks through a phase of adequate pain control by an opioid-based therapy. The NP-BTcP occurs in the absence of any specific activity. In this paper, we addressed the topic through a mathematical approach to provide many indications for identifying the diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in NP-BTcP management. ABSTRACT: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a temporary exacerbation of pain that breaks through a phase of adequate pain control by an opioid-based therapy. The non-predictable BTcP (NP-BTcP) is a subtype of BTcP that occurs in the absence of any specific activity. Since NP-BTcP has an important clinical impact, this analysis is aimed at characterizing the NP-BTcP phenomenon through a multidimensional statistical technique. This is a secondary analysis based on the Italian Oncologic Pain multiSettingMulticentric Survey (IOPS-MS). A correlation analysis was performed to characterize the NP-BTcP profile about its intensity, number of episodes per day, and type. The multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) determined the identification of four groups (phenotypes). A univariate analysis was performed to assess differences between the four phenotypes and selected covariates. The four phenotypes represent the hierarchical classification according to the status of NP-BTcP: from the best (phenotype 1) to the worst (phenotype 4). The univariate analysis found a significant association between the onset time >10 min in the phenotype 1 (37.3%) vs. the onset > 10 min in phenotype 4 (25.8%) (p < 0.001). Phenotype 1 was characterized by the gastrointestinal type of cancer (26.4%) with respect to phenotype 4, where the most frequent cancer affected the lung (28.8%) (p < 0.001). Phenotype 4 was mainly managed with rapid-onset opioids, while in phenotype 1, many patients were treated with oral, subcutaneous, or intravenous morphine (56.4% and 44.4%, respectively; p = 0.008). The ability to characterize NP-BTcP can offer enormous benefits for the management of this serious aspect of cancer pain. Although requiring validation, this strategy can provide many indications for identifying the diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in NP-BTcP management.","output":"Multidimensional Statistical Technique for Interpreting the Spontaneous Breakthrough Cancer Pain Phenomenon.

As female patients usually experience longer delays before diagnosis and treatment, we assessed whether women were more affected by the dramatic drop in hospital admissions for ACS during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in Northern Italy comparing men and women data. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: the corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and the earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). Incidence rate ratios comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated with the use of Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 547 patients who were hospitalized for ACS during the study period, only 127 (23%) were females, accounting for a mean of 3.1 admissions per day, while ACS hospitalized males were 420, with a mean of 10.2 admissions per day. There was a significant decrease driven by a similar reduction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) diagnosis in both sexes compared to the control periods. A trend toward a greater reduction in admitted females was shown in the intra-year control period (46% admission reduction in females vs 37% in males, with females accounting for 26% of ACS, P=0.10) and a significant reduction when compared to the previous year control period (40% admission reduction in females vs 23% in males, with females accounting for 28% of ACS, P=0.03), mainly related to Unstable Angina diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic period closed the gap between men and women in ACS, with similar rates of reduction of hospitalized STEMI and NSTEMI and a trend toward greater reduction in UA admission among women.

Especially important for knowledge dissemination is the ability to form new weak ties -- ties which act as bridges between distant parts of the social system and enable the flow of novel information. Here we show that lack of researcher co-location during the COVID-19 lockdown caused the loss of more than 4800 weak ties over 18 months in the email network of a large North American university -- the MIT campus. Furthermore, we find that the re-introduction of partial co-location through a hybrid work mode starting in September 2021 led to a partial regeneration of weak ties, especially between researchers who work in close proximity. We quantify the effect of co-location in renewing ties -- a process that we have termed nexogenesis -- through a novel model based on physical proximity, which is able to reproduce all empirical observations. Results highlight that employees who are not co-located are less likely to form ties, weakening the spread of information in the workplace. Such findings could contribute to a better understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of human communication networks -- and help organizations that are moving towards the implementation of hybrid work policies to evaluate the minimum amount of in-person interaction necessary for a healthy work life.","output":"The effect of co-location of human communication networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although recent epidemiological data suggest that pneumococci may contribute to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease, secondary pneumococcal pneumonia has been reported as infrequent.

We assessed the effect of co-infection on host antibody, cellular and inflammatory responses to the virus. In both cohorts, pneumococcal colonisation was associated with diminished anti-viral immune responses, which affected primarily mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients. Our findings suggest that S. pneumoniae modulates host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raises the question if pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses through a similar mechanism and facilitates reinfection occurrence.","output":"Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation associates with impaired adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Comprehensive information about the accuracy of antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to guide public health decision makers in choosing the best tests and testing policies. In August 2021, we published a systematic review and meta-analysis about the accuracy of Ag-RDTs. We now update this work and analyze the factors influencing test sensitivity in further detail. METHODS AND FINDINGS We registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020225140). We systematically searched preprint and peer-reviewed databases for publications evaluating the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 until August 31, 2021. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing as a reference. To evaluate factors influencing test sensitivity, we performed 3 different analyses using multivariable mixed-effects meta-regression models. We included 194 studies with 221,878 Ag-RDTs performed. Overall, the pooled estimates of Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.8 to 74.2) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6 to 99.1). When manufacturer instructions were followed, sensitivity increased to 76.3% (95% CI 73.7 to 78.7). Sensitivity was markedly better on samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (97.9% [95% CI 96.9 to 98.9] and 90.6% [95% CI 88.3 to 93.0] for Ct-values <20 and <25, compared to 54.4% [95% CI 47.3 to 61.5] and 18.7% [95% CI 13.9 to 23.4] for Ct-values 25 and 30) and was estimated to increase by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI 1.7 to 4.0) for every unit decrease in mean Ct-value when adjusting for testing procedure and patients' symptom status. Concordantly, we found the mean Ct-value to be lower for true positive (22.2 [95% CI 21.5 to 22.8]) compared to false negative (30.4 [95% CI 29.7 to 31.1]) results. Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially higher sensitivity (81.9% [95% CI 77.7 to 85.5]) compared to testing after 1 week (51.8%, 95% CI 41.5 to 61.9). Similarly, sensitivity was higher in symptomatic (76.2% [95% CI 73.3 to 78.9]) compared to asymptomatic (56.8% [95% CI 50.9 to 62.4]) persons. However, both effects were mainly driven by the Ct-value of the sample. With regards to sample type, highest sensitivity was found for nasopharyngeal (NP) and combined NP/oropharyngeal samples (70.8% [95% CI 68.3 to 73.2]), as well as in anterior nasal/mid-turbinate samples (77.3% [95% CI 73.0 to 81.0]). Our analysis was limited by the included studies' heterogeneity in viral load assessment and sample origination. CONCLUSIONS Ag-RDTs detect most of the individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and almost all (>90%) when high viral loads are present. With viral load, as estimated by Ct-value, being the most influential factor on their sensitivity, they are especially useful to detect persons with high viral load who are most likely to transmit the virus. To further quantify the effects of other factors influencing test sensitivity, standardization of clinical accuracy studies and access to patient level Ct-values and duration of symptoms are needed.","output":"Accuracy of rapid point-of-care antigen-based diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression analyzing influencing factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins in biological fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) are important biomarkers of various pathological conditions.

We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing an altered composition of the nasal/oropharyngeal (NOP) microbiota in 21 patients affected by COVID-19, paucisymptomatic or in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as compared to 10 controls negative for COVID-19 or eight affected by a different Human Coronavirus (HKU, NL63 and OC43). A significant decrease in Chao1 index was observed when patients affected by COVID-19 (in ICU) were compared to paucisymptomatic. Furthermore, patients who were in ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other Coronaviruses all displayed a decrease in the Chao1 index when compared to controls, while Shannon index significantly decreased only in patients under ICU as compared to controls and paucisymptomatic patients. At the phylum level, Deinococcus-Thermus was present only in controls as compared to SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other coronaviruses. Candidatus Saccharibacteria (formerly known as TM7) was strongly increased in negative controls and SARS-CoV-2 paucisymptomatic patients as compared to SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients.

METHODS: This was an observational, questionnaire based study, carried out in Hungary, between February and March 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of 45 questions, that surveyed the impact of the pandemic among IBD patients, and the severity and outcome of the infection. Participants were on biologic therapy. Our aim was to determine the frequency and outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on different biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 387 respondents completed the questionnaire, and 47 participants (12%) developed COVID-19 infection. 66.9% of them were receiving anti-TNF inhibitor, 16.8% vedolizumab, 12.1% ustekinumab, and 4.1% tofacitinib.

Furthermore, 38.3% suspended the current biologic therapy, but it didnt decrease the rate of hospitalization (p=0.533), however, it didnt cause flare-ups either in the primary disease (p=0.415). Based on our cohort, neither vitamin supplementations meant protection against the infection (p=0.117), only regular mask wearing seems to protect patients with IBD (p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Based on our cohort, more IBD patients develop the infection in Hungary, compared to international data, however, the outcome of the infection is more favourable. It seems, that the different biological treatments dont affect the infection rate, and neither elevates the hospitalization rate. In generally, there is no need to suspend the current biologic therapy, however, it should be a matter of individual judgment. After all, we claim that mask-wearing still seems to be the most effective form of prevention.","output":"P666 Frequency and outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on different biological therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the 2016 Horse River Wildfire in northern Alberta, the provincial health authority, the ministry of health, non-profit and charitable organizations, and regional community-based service agencies mobilized to address the growing health and mental health concerns among Indigenous residents and communities through the provision of services and supports. Among the communities and residents that experienced significant devastation and loss were First Nation and Mtis residents in the region. Provincial and local funding was allocated to new recovery positions and to support pre-existing health and social programs. The objective of this research was to qualitatively describe the health systems response to the health impacts following the wildfire from the perspective of service providers who were directly responsible for delivering or organizing health and mental wellness services and supports to Indigenous residents. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 Indigenous and 10 non-Indigenous service providers from the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a constant comparative analysis method was used to identify themes. Following service provider interviews, a supplemental document review was completed to provide background and context for the qualitative findings from interviews. The document review allowed for a better understanding of the health systems response at a systems level following the wildfire. Triangulation of semi-structured interviews and organization report documents confirmed our findings. The conceptual framework by Mirzoev and Kane for understanding health systems responsiveness guided our data interpretation. Our findings were divided into three themes (1) service provision in response to Indigenous mental health concerns (2) gaps in Indigenous health-related services post-wildfire and (3) adopting a health equity lens in post-disaster recovery. The knowledge gained from this research can help inform future emergency management and assist policy and decision makers with culturally safe and responsive recovery planning. Future recovery and response efforts should consider identifying and addressing underlying health, mental health, and emotional concerns in order to be more effective in assisting with healing for Indigenous communities following a public health emergency such as a wildfire disaster.","output":"Health Systems Responsiveness in Addressing Indigenous Residents' Health and Mental Health Needs Following the 2016 Horse River Wildfire in Northern Alberta, Canada: Perspectives From Health Service Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simulation model is developed to analyze the spread of covid-19 in universities. The model can be used to conduct a what-if analysis and estimate infection cases under different policies. For proof-of-concept, the model is simulated for a hypothetical university of 25,000 students and 3,000 faculty/staff in a U.S. college town. Simulation results show that early outbreaks are very likely, and there is no silver bullet to avoid them. Instead, a combination of policies should be carefully implemented. The results suggest (almost) full remote university operations from the beginning of the semester. In a less-preferred alternative, if universities decide to have students attend in person, they should encourage remote operations for high-risk individuals, conduct frequent rapid tests, enforce mask use, communicate with students and employees about the risks, and promote social distancing. Universities should be willing to move to remote operations if cases rise. Under this scenario, and considering implementation challenges, many universities are still likely to experience an early outbreak, and the likelihood of having a case of death is worrisome. In the long run, students and faculty react to the risks, and even if universities decide to continue operations, classes are likely to have very low in-person attendance. Overall, our analysis depicts several sources of system complexities, negative unintended consequences of relying on a single policy, non-linear incremental effects, and positive synergies of implementing multiple policies. A simulation platform for a what-if analysis is offered so marginal effectiveness of different policies and different decision-making thresholds for closure can be tested for universities of varying populations.","output":"Simulation-based what-if analysis for controlling the spread of Covid-19 in universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction/Background ? ERAS (Enhanced Recovery after Surgery) is a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures. This study aimed to analyse the feasibility of ERAS in the era of pandemic and to find its effect on the post-operative outcome of patients undergoing surgery for gynaecological cancer during the COVID pandemic Methodology This observational study was done on patients who underwent gynaecological cancer surgery during COVID pandemic in a tertiary cancer centre in South India. Data was collected including patient demographics, nature of surgery, adherence to each of the components of ERAS programme and outcomes. Post operative complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification Result(s)? 152 patients were included in the study period from June to December 2020. 85 patients had cancer ovary, 59 cancer endometrium, 6 cancer cervix and 1 cancer vulva and 7 patients had benign tumours. In the pre operative component of ERAS protocols,82% patients received pre surgery counselling, 97% received thromboembolic prophylaxis, 94% received carbohydrate loading and none of the patients received mechanical bowel preparation. 8% received blood components during and after surgery. In the post operative phase on Day 1, 62% patients had urinary catheter removed, 88% received normal diet and 92% had early ambulation. The complication rate was 26%, but majority 79% had grade 1 and 2 complications. There was one postoperative mortality due to sepsis. The mean hospital stay was 6.6 days. Conclusion?

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study with 83 fifth-year medical students in an academic hospital. During a one-month placement, they were instructed to do web-based illness scripts. Their performances were assessed by examination in the last week. All recorded data about illness scripts and examination results were retrieved. The students were separated into high and low response groups based on completed illness scripts. The characteristics of the students between the two groups were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients and regression analysis were used to identify the relationship between illness scripts and examination results. RESULTS: There were 56 students in the high-response and 27 in the low-response groups. The characteristics and examination scores were not significantly different between the groups, while there was a significant difference in script completion (t((27))=13.72, p<0.001). Using Pearson correlation, we found weak correlations without significance between completed scripts, illness script scores, and examination scores. We found no relationship between illness script scores and examination scores, even in the high response group, by regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of web-based orthopedic illness scripts did not correlate to the examination performance of medical students. A high number of scripts without variety and limited time for practicing may have obscured potential positive relationships. Illness scripts should be adjusted as appropriate for each school before being assigned.

METHODS: To investigate the RVs etiology among adolescents and adults with CAP, according to age and pneumonia severity index (PSI), a multi-center, prospective study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2012. Fifteen RVs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were detected by urinary antigen, conventional culture and PCR. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and median (IQR) PSI score of 954 patients enrolled was 45.2 (19.5) years (range 14C94) and 42 (36). RVs were found in 262 patients (27.5%): influenza virus A (IFV A, 9.9%) comprised of pandemic H1N1 (6.7%) and seasonal H3N2 (3.5%), human rhinovirus (4.3%), adenovirus (4.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.8%), parainfluenza virus 1, 3 and 2 (1.7%, 1.5% and 1.2%).

We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables.

In particular, 2020 is the year set for review of the nationally determined contributions (NDC) previously submitted by each Party of the Paris Agreement, and for submitting long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LEDS). In addition, many countries are seeking a sustainable economic recovery plan that reflects climate change and environmental considerations to overcome COVID-19. Also, as major greenhouse gas emitters participate in the declaration of carbon neutrality vision and EU plans to introduce carbon border tax, the issue of greenhouse gas reduction is expected to affect not only domestic economic and industrial policies, but also diplomatic and international trade sectors. Accordingly, this research was carried out to present our policy recommendations by analyzing measures to strengthen greenhouse gas reduction targets and the economic impact of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Chapter 2 covers recent discussions in the international community on transition to a low-carbon economy and carbon neutrality, and government policies related to GHG reduction in EU, USA, China, Japan and Korea are reviewed. In order to promote the European Green Deal to achieve carbon neutrality in the region by 2050, the EU has established action plans for each sector such as industry, power generation, resource circular economy, and transportation, while also making considerations for financial aid and support for the vulnerable. In the case of the United States, which has been pursuing a rather conservative environmental policy under the Trump administration, as Joe Biden has been elected in the 2020 presidential election, significant changes are expected in policies to respond to climate change. China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, has shown a somewhat inconsistent policy stance in regulating fossil fuels, but the country also proposes achieving carbon neutrality until 2060. Japan has also announced carbon neutrality by 2050. Korea recently presented the vision of the Green New Deal as part of the Korean New Deal and plans to realize net zero by 2050. Chapter 3 examines the status of greenhouse gas emissions in major countries, and analyzes the characteristics of carbon dioxide emissions embodied in international trade, mainly in the EU and Korea. We have found that mainly developed countries were net importers of carbon dioxide embodied in trade as of 2015, while many Asian countries excluding Japan were net exporters. Based on the OECDa?s emissions and trade data, we have estimated additional costs assuming that the EU imposes a tax of 30 euros (36 dollars) per ton of carbon dioxide embodied in imported goods from non-EU countries. These results can be considered equivalent to the costs of imposing a certain percentage of tariffs. Among the EUa?s major trading partner countries, India would be required to pay extra costs equivalent to the highest tariff rate of 4.6% while China would be faced with the largest cost of over 11.9 billion dollars in scale with a tariff rate of 2.6%. Korea would be charged the same cost as the 1.9% tariff rate. Indeed, the impact of introducing carbon border tariffs or carbon taxes limited to imported goods will be determined by various factors such as the structure of global value chain between countries. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare countermeasures based on the results of objective research. The theoretical model in Chapter 4 assumed a political system with a democratic decision-making process. Specifically, this model assumes that there are two groups of economic actors a Group F (Fossil fuels) and Group R (Renewable energy) in the economy under the democratic political system. The difference between these groups is their ow production technology, assuming that the Group F has a fossil fuel-based production technology and the Group R has a renewable energy-based production technology. We found that economic actors with fossil fuel-based production technology prefer a relatively low carbon tax rate to those with renewable energy-based production technology. This model derives the political economy equilibrium of a carbon tax policy by analyzing the endogenous decision process of the policy through a political economy approach in which two groups engage in political competition within a macroeconomic model. At the end of 2019, the EU announced a blueprint called the European Green Deal to actively respond to climate change, including the introduction of thr CBAM. A public survey was conducted to collect opinions, with the aim of submitting legislation of this mechanism by the first half of 2021. It was found that the EU is considering three implementation plans: the first is to apply a carbon tax to imported goods and products within the EU, the second is to impose carbon customs duties only on imported goods in the form of tariffs, and the third is to apply the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) to goods imported into the EU. In this context, Chapter 5 analyzes the economic impact of the introduction of the CBAM on the trade patterns of Korea and other major trading countries. We used the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with GTAP data, and estimated the impact of imposing taxes derived in Chapter 3 on specific industries in the form of tariffs. Our approach also considered the possibility that the carbon border tax would be preferentially applied to industries such as cement and steel with high carbon emissions. As a result, we found that exports from major trading countries to the EU declined significantly as the EUa?s own production increased for industries that imposed a carbon border. In particular, China, India, and Russia, which have high unit carbon emissions, saw the largest decrease in exports to the EU. Chapter 6 presents the basic strategies and policy recommendations for effective response to the introduction of the carbon border adjustment system by partner countries including the EU, and to realize Koreaa?s low-carbon transition and carbon-neutral goals. First, it is necessary to support low-carbon transition efforts in industries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels and are vulnerable to emission regulations. To do this, sufficient discussions with stakeholders have to be preceded. Sharing domestic and foreign policy trends and persuading the industries to reduce emissions are also required. For example, tax incentives can influence companiesa? decisions, encouraging them to change their existing diesel trucks to hydrogen electric trucks. It is also necessary to support retraining and re-employment of workers in fossil fuel-related industries.","output":"Increasing Global Climate Ambition and Implications for Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variants of the COVID-19 causative virus have been arising and circulating globally.

The mechanisms underlying poorly controlled hypertension remain incompletely understood. Recent development in the Cre/LoxP approach to study gain or loss of function of a particular gene has significantly helped advance our new insights into the role of proximal tubule angiotensin II (Ang II) and its AT(1) (AT(1a)) receptors in basal blood pressure control and the development of Ang II-induced hypertension. This novel approach has provided us and others with an important tool to generate novel mouse models with proximal tubule-specific loss (deletion) or gain of the function (overexpression). The objective of this invited review article is to review and discuss recent findings using novel genetically modifying proximal tubule-specific mouse models. These new studies have consistently demonstrated that deletion of AT(1) (AT(1a)) receptors or its direct downstream target Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) selectively in the proximal tubules of the kidney lowers basal blood pressure, increases the pressure-natriuresis response, and induces natriuretic responses, whereas overexpression of an intracellular Ang II fusion protein or AT(1) (AT(1a)) receptors selectively in the proximal tubules increases proximal tubule Na(+) reabsorption, impairs the pressure-natriuresis response, and elevates blood pressure. Furthermore, the development of Ang II-induced hypertension by systemic Ang II infusion or by proximal tubule-specific overexpression of an intracellular Ang II fusion protein was attenuated in mutant mice with proximal tubule-specific deletion of AT(1) (AT(1a)) receptors or NHE3. Thus, these recent studies provide evidence for and new insights into the important roles of intratubular Ang II via AT(1) (AT(1a)) receptors and NHE3 in the proximal tubules in maintaining basal blood pressure homeostasis and the development of Ang II-induced hypertension.","output":"Angiotensin II and AT(1a) Receptors in the Proximal Tubules of the Kidney: New Roles in Blood Pressure Control and Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning for primary and secondary students has expanded significantly in the United States during the last two decades.

Physical inactivity costs the UK 7.4 billion annually (Public Health England 2019) and is responsible for one in six UK deaths. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption are all modifiable lifestyle factors which influence our quality and length of life. With increasing life expectancy and obesity levels, we need to shift our focus to management of long-term musculoskeletal conditions with multi morbidity (NICE Guidelines- Multi Morbidity 2016). We decided to turn the lens inward on our own clinical behaviours, to make every contact count (MECC) considering that obesity is a leading risk factor for osteoarthritis (Pan et al., 2020). Our aim was to upskill the team in MECC conversations to make meaningful behavioural change for the population regionally. This was identified via clinical supervision, notes audits and from minimal MECC change training at both undergraduate and post graduate level. Potential reasons for clinicians not engaging in MECC conversations relate to lack of training, risk of offending patients, prioritisation and/or time pressures. Methods: We looked at Public Health England's local South Tyneside data to shape our MECC vision (PHE Fingertips). Afterwards, we completed public health service mapping, created patient information leaflets on MECC topics and shared these with the team. We prioritised the team undergoing training (11 h per clinician) in motivational interviewing, brief interventions regard healthy eating, smoking and alcohol cessation between July 2020 to March 2021. The team focused on developing relationships with Link workers by delivering in-service training with them and involving them in our pathways. We integrated MECC into clinical templates to ensure data was captured to gauge the training uptake. Results: From September 2020-April 2021, the South Tyneside Community Musculoskeletal (MSK) Service have instigated over 7,000 initial appointment conversations with patients on smoking, alcohol, weight loss and physical activity. This was coupled with 9,000 MECC conversations at follow up appointments with 62.84% of clinicians engaging overall. Our patient related experiential measures had increased to 94.04% over the last quarter (Jan-April 21) with collection rate of 44%. This is a 2% increase in comparison to the same period last year, 3% increase over the year in total despite COVID. Patients and clinicians have engaged with 67% of consultations about exercise and smoking, 66% of consultations about alcohol and weight. Conclusion(s): Lifestyle modification conversations can occur within a MSK Community services setting. Upskilling clinicians to provide brief MECC interventions now is of paramount importance to further reduce the burden of long term MSK conditions. This may be enhanced with utilising patient activation measures pending further research. Impact: Upskilling MSK clinicians with advanced communication skills for MECC brief interventions will enable the identification of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and offer effective signposting in primary care. This has implications for undergraduate curriculums to better prepare the workforce for evidence based behaviour change thus reducing the cost and healthcare burden.

Despite the natural co-occurrence of intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts in the transformation toward sustainability, both types of conflicts have been studied predominantly in isolation. In this conceptual article, we breathe new life into the traditional dialog between individual decision-making and negotiation research and address critical psychological barriers to the transformation toward sustainability. In particular, we argue that research on intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts should be tightly integrated to provide a richer understanding of the interplay between these conflicts. We propose a novel, unifying framework of interdependent conflicts that systematically structures this interplay, and we analyze how complex interdependencies between the social (i.e., conflict between decision-makers) and temporal (i.e., conflict within a decision-maker) dimensions pose fundamental psychological barriers to mutually beneficial solutions. Since challenges to conflict resolution in the transformation toward sustainability emerge not only between individual decision-makers but also frequently between groups of decision-makers, we scale the framework up to the level of social groups and thereby provide an interdependent-conflicts perspective on the interplay between intra- and intergenerational conflicts. Overall, we propose simple, testable propositions, identify intervention approaches, and apply them to transition management. By analyzing the challenges faced by negotiating parties during interdependent conflicts and highlighting potential intervention approaches, we contribute to the transformation toward sustainability.

However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 na?ve and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory.

Omicron also shows substantial immune escape from serum antibodies in convalescent patients and vaccinees.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (&#8805;10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 versus <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR = 1.73, [95% CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]).

Most specialists (86%) work in EDs that cohort patients, about one-third (34%) do not use spotters during PPE doffing, few have policy regarding breaches in PPE, and most do not have required space for physical distancing in non-clinical areas. Initial PPE training, simulations and segregating patients were widespread but appear to be waning with persistent low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. PPE shortages were not identified in NZ EDs, yet 13% of consultants did not indicate they would use respirators during aerosol generating procedures on COVID-19 patients. Treatment interventions including non-invasive ventilation and high flow nasal cannula were common. Many respondents reported high levels of stress attributable to predicted inadequate staffing and the state of overall preparedness in event of a second wave. Conclusions New Zealand emergency specialists identified significant gaps in COVID-19 preparedness, and they have a unique opportunity to translate lessons from other locations into local action. Proactive identification of weaknesses in hospital engineering, policy, and PPE practice in advance of future SARS-CoV-2 endemic transmission would be prudent.","output":"New Zealand Emergency Department COVID-19 Preparedness Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth experience health disparities due to stigma and victimization.

Using a multiple case study design, we aimed to develop an in-depth and cross-contextual understanding of TGD youth healthcare experiences in one Midwestern state. Families with a TGD child under 18 were recruited with the goal of cross-case diversity by child age, gender, race, and/or region of the state; we obtained diversity in child age and region only. Four white families with TGD boys or non-binary youth (4C16) in rural, suburban, and small towns participated in interviews and observations for one year; public data were collected from each familys community. Thematic analysis was used within and across cases to develop both family-level understanding and identify themes across families.

Ehrlichia translocated factor-1 (Etf-1), a type IV secretion system (T4SS) effector, is a primary virulence factor for an obligatory intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis In this study, we developed Etf-1-specific nanobodies (Nbs) by immunizing a llama to determine if intracellular Nbs block Etf-1 functions and Ehrlichia infection. Of 24 distinct anti-Etf-1 Nbs, NbD7 blocked mitochondrial localization of Etf-1-GFP in cotransfected cells. NbD7 and control Nb (NbD3) bound to different regions of Etf-1. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that the NbD7 and Etf-1 complex was more stable than the NbD3 and Etf-1 complex. Intracellular expression of NbD7 inhibited three activities of Etf-1 and E. chaffeensis: up-regulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Consequently, intracellular NbD7 inhibited Ehrlichia infection, whereas NbD3 did not. To safely and effectively deliver Nbs into the host cell cytoplasm, NbD7 was conjugated to cyclized cell-permeable peptide 12 (CPP12-NbD7). CPP12-NbD7 effectively entered mammalian cells and abrogated the blockade of cellular apoptosis caused by E. chaffeensis and inhibited infection by E. chaffeensis in cell culture and in a severe combined-immunodeficiency mouse model. Our results demonstrate the development of an Nb that interferes with T4SS effector functions and intracellular pathogen infection, along with an intracellular delivery method for this Nb. This strategy should overcome current barriers to advance mechanistic research and develop therapies complementary or alternative to the current broad-spectrum antibiotic.","output":"An intracellular nanobody targeting T4SS effector inhibits Ehrlichia infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent years have seen a raise in the development of computational proteins including symmetric ones.

Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems but are threatened globally by many forms of human disturbance. Understanding the responses of wetland species to human disturbance is essential for effective wetland management and conservation. 2. We undertook a study to determine (i) whether anurans can be used effectively to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands affected by groundwater withdrawal and, if so, (ii) what effect increasing urbanization might have on the utility of anurans as wetland indicators. We monitored the intensity of anuran calls at 42 wetlands in south\\\\western Florida throughout 2001C2002 and 2005C2009. 3. We first validated the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity using a small group of wetlands by comparing anuran calling and subsequent tadpole development with an established index employing vegetation composition and structure. We then verified that the results could be expanded to a variety of sites throughout the region. Finally, we focused on urbanized wetlands to determine whether urbanization could interfere with the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity. 4. We used PRESENCE to estimate occupancy and detection probabilities and to examine the relationship between occupancy and five covariates expected to influence individual species occurrence. We used FRAGSTATS to calculate the mean proximity index for urbanized wetlands, which assesses the size and distribution of land use types within a specified area. 5. Our results showed that the group of species including oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus, southern cricket frog Acris gryllus, pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis, barking treefrog Hyla gratiosa, and little grass frog Pseudacris ocularis is a reliable indicator of wetland integrity. However, this same group of species, which is sensitive to wetland health, is selectively excluded from urbanized wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Although anurans are effective indicators of wetland health and complement vegetation surveys, the usefulness of this group for monitoring the ecological integrity of wetlands can be substantially reduced, or eliminated, as a consequence of urbanization. We urge for careful consideration of confounding factors in any studies examining the utility of indicator species.","output":"Urbanization interferes with the use of amphibians as indicators of ecological integrity of wetlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientists around the world have risen to the challenges posed by COVID-19 by rapidly transforming their laboratories and refocusing their research efforts.","output":"Detecting COVID-19 at the bedside"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Today, COVID-19 is spreading around the world. Information about its mechanism, prognostic factors, and management is minimal. COVID-19, as a human disease, has several identifying phases. Physicians of patients with COVID-19 may be interested in knowing whether opioid use disorder may affect their patients course or prognosis. This information may be crucial when considering the opioid epidemic in the US and other parts of the world. Opioid use at high doses and over several months duration can mitigate the immune systems function, which may complicate the course of COVID-19 disease. Potential suppression of parts of the immune response may be important in prevention, clinical support, and therapeutic use of medications in various phases of the COVID-19. Specifically, opioid use disorders via an inhalation route may enhance the late hyper-inflammatory phase or result in end-organ damage. It is well established that opioids decrease ventilation as their effect on the medullary respiratory centers increases the risk of pneumonia. This increased risk has been associated with immune-suppressive opioids. The ultimate role of opioids in COVID-19 is not clear.

While telemedicine is rapidly evolving in the fields of teleconsultation and telesurgery, proper telediagnostic systems are not yet available, although the demand for contactless patientCdoctor interaction is increasing. METHODS: In this project, the current limitations were addressed by developing a comprehensive telediagnostic system. Therefore, medical examinations have been assessed in collaboration with medical experts. Subsequently, a framework was developed, satisfying the relevant constraints of medical-, technical-, and hygienic- aspects in order to transform in-person examinations into a contactless procedure. Diagnostic steps were classified into three groups: assisted procedures carried out by the patient, teleoperated examination methods, and adoptions of conventional methods. RESULTS: The Telemedical Diagnostic Framework was implemented, resulting in a functional proof of concept, where potentially infectious patients could undergo a full medical examination. The system comprises, e.g., a naso-pharyngeal swab, an inspection of the oral cavity, auscultation, percussion, and palpation, based on robotic end-effectors. The physician is thereby connected using a newly developed user-interface and a lead robot, with force feedback control, that enables precise movements with the follower robot on the patients side. CONCLUSION: Our concept proves the feasibility of a fully telediagnostic system, that consolidates available technology and new developments to an efficient solution enabling safe patient-doctor interaction.

COVID-19 has affected over 200 countries and territories. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of eosinopenia in differentiating COVID-19 suspect from other flu-like illnesses in an outpatient setting. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective case control study in which data of 1252 suspected COVID 19 patients who visited the fever clinic were enrolled. Among this, 701 patients were found to have COVID-19 pneumonia and 551 had other flu-like illnesses. CBC (complete blood count) and CRP (C-reactive protein) were taken in all patients along with chest x-ray as routine protocol. Results: Among the 701 positive patients, eosinopenia was seen in 527 patients and had a sensitivity of 75.2 % and specificity of 68.6 %. When combined with other lab parameters such as the increased CRP and lymphopenia, the specificity rises up to 78.6 %. Conclusion: Our study shows that eosinopenia as an independent variable, is a reliable marker to differentiate COVID-19 suspect patients from other flu-like illnesses on outpatient basis, however when combined with other parameters like lymphopenia and CRP the specificity increases further.","output":"Clinical usefulness of eosinopenia in differentiating covid-19 versus other flu-like illness in outpatient set-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2147/RMHP.S239984.].","output":"Erratum: Syndromic Surveillance System for MERS-CoV as New Early Warning and Identification Approach [Corrigendum]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks have occurred in China and many countries around the world. The effectiveness of oseltamivir on COVID-19 suspected outpatients without hypoxia was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 16 COVID-19 suspected medical personnel and their cohabitation families without hypoxia, who came to the adult fever clinic from March to June 2020 were studied. All patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir) and antibacterial therapy together. RESULTS: Most of the infected patients were female (10, 63%), 1 had diabetes (6%) and 3 hypertension (19%). The median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31C60 years). Oseltamivir administration made the temperature fall within 24 h in part (10, 63%). Clinical data were compared between patients receiving early treatment (ET) with oseltamivir, initiated within 24 h, and patients administered late treatment (LT), initiated after this time point. Duration of fever was shorter in the ET group than in the LT group (31  21 h versus 94  38 h; p < 0.001). The time from fever onset to treatment initiation correlated with duration of fever (r = 0.77; p < 0.001) and the time from peak to decline (r = 0.58; p < 0.05).

We aimed to describe global trends and regional diversities in incidence of malaria infection, to make global tailored implications for malaria prevention. METHODS: We used the data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) and absolute number of malaria episodes showed the epidemic status of malaria infection. The estimated annual percentage change of ASR and changes in malaria episodes quantified the malaria incidence trends. The connection between ASRs and traveller number indicated infection risk for travellers. RESULTS: Globally, the malaria ASR decreased by an average 0.80% (95% confidence interval 0.58C1.02%) per year from 1990 to 2019; however, it slightly increased from 3195.32 per 100 000 in 2015 to 3247.02 per 100 000 in 2019. The incidence rate of children under 5 was higher than other age groups. A total of 40 countries had higher ASRs in 2019 than in 2015, with the largest expansion in Cabo Verde (from 2.02 per 100 000 to 597.00 per 100 000). After 2015, the ASRs in high-middle, middle and low-middle Socio-demographic Index regions began to rise and the uptrends remained in 2019.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of social support, coping strategy against COVID-19, and anxiety, identifying the potential mediating effect of coping strategy between social support and anxiety during the COVID-19 quarantine. Home-quarantined Chinese university students (N = 2640;68.79% female) completed online ratings of social support, coping, and anxiety from February 21st to 24th, 2020, when they had been confined to their homes in the peak of the pandemic.

Anxiety was significantly negatively related to subjective support and counselor support, while family support did not demonstrate substantive associations with anxiety. The mediating role of cognitive coping was found between all the three social support sources and anxiety. Emotional coping and behavioral coping were found to partially mediate the relationship between subjective support and anxiety, fully mediate the associations of family support and anxiety. However, the impact of counselor support on anxiety was not found to be mediated by emotional coping and behavioral coping.

This study used a descriptive correlational design, and the data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The study sample included 308 students from Shiraz University, Iran. The results showed that digital competence positively and significantly correlated with students' DIL and their academic engagement. Furthermore, DIL, as the mediator variable, was found to mediate the relationship between students' digital competence and their academic engagement.

The high number of vaccinations may be one of the reasons why children show a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and milder severity when compared to adults. We have designed a study aimed at investigating whether the influenza vaccine may reduce the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We retrospectively enrolled 635 patients who accessed our Emergency Department from March 1st to June 30th, 2020, and were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by an RT-PCR on an oropharyngeal swab. Clinical data, outcomes, and influenza vaccination status were collected from the electronic medical records of our Hospital. We also used data from the Italian Health Ministry to compare the prevalence of flu vaccination among the general population of the Lazio Region and our enrolled patients. We then compared clinical outcomes between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients, by univariate and multivariate analysis. COVID-19-positive patients older than 65 years reported a lower prevalence of flu vaccination when compared to the general population residing in the Lazio (p = 0.004). After correction for gender, age, and comorbidities, we found a lower risk of death at 60 days in patients with flu vaccination than in not vaccinated patients (p = 0.001).

We tested the hypothesis that diabetes is a risk factor for poor early outcomes, after adjustment for obesity, among a cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) COVID-19 Data Registry of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020. Primary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, and death within 14 days of presentation to care. Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic characteristics, obesity, and relevant comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 450 patients, 178 (39.6%) had diabetes-mostly type 2 diabetes. Among patients with diabetes versus patients without diabetes, a higher proportion was admitted to the ICU (42.1% vs. 29.8%, respectively, P = 0.007), required mechanical ventilation (37.1% vs. 23.2%, P = 0.001), and died (15.9% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.009). In multivariable logistic regression models, diabetes was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (odds ratio 1.59 [95% CI 1.01-2.52]), mechanical ventilation (1.97 [1.21-3.20]), and death (2.02 [1.01-4.03]) at 14 days. Obesity was associated with greater odds of ICU admission (2.16 [1.20-3.88]) and mechanical ventilation (2.13 [1.14-4.00]) but not with death.

OBJECTIVE With the aim of identifying the broad acting antiviral and anticancer agents, we discovered substituted aryl/heteroaryl derived thienyl chalcones as antiviral and anticancer agents. METHOD A focused set of thienyl chalcone derivaties II-VI was screened for selected viruses Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Dengue virus 2 (DENV2), Influenza A (H1N1) virus, MERS coronavirus, Poliovirus 1 (PV 1), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Tacaribe virus (TCRV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and Zika virus (ZIKV) using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program. Additionally, a cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has been screened for 60 human cancer cell lines using the Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of NCI. RESULTS All thienyl chalcone derivatives II-VI displayed moderate to excellent antiviral activity towards several viruses tested. Compounds V and VI were turned out be active compounds towards human cytomegalovirus for both normal strain (AD169) as well as resistant isolate (GDGr K17). Particularly, cyano derivative V showed very high potency (EC50: <0.05 M) towards AD169 strain of HCMV compared to standard drug Ganciclovir (EC50: 0.12 M). Additionally, it showed moderate activity in the secondary assay (AD169; EC50: 2.30 M). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV displayed high potency towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Tacaribe virus (TCRV) towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV is nearly 28 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: 0.39 g/ml) and nearly 17 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: 0.71 g/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 11 g/ml; visual assay and EC50: 12 g/ml; neutral red assay). It is nearly 12 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: >1 g/ml) and nearly 8 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: >1.3 g/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 12 g/ml; visual assay and EC50: 9.9 g/ml; neutral red assay) towards Tacaribe virus (TCRV). Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has shown strong growth inhibitory activity towards three major cancers (colon, breast, and leukemia) cell lines and moderate growth inhibition shown towards other cancer cell lines screened. CONCLUSION Compounds V and VI were demonstrated viral inhibition towards Human cytomegalovirus, whereas cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV towards Rift Valley fever virus and Tacaribe virus. Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has displayed very good cytotoxicity against colon, breast and leukemia cell lines in vitro.","output":"Exploration of (hetero)aryl Derived Thienylchalcones for Antiviral and Anticancer Activities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Notes from the Field article discusses language assistance within healthcare during the COVID-19 public health crisis.

As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning cancer caregivers' distinctive challenges amid COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus from the database inception to the end of March 2021. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy will be developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened against eligibility criteria developed a priori. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has upended cancer care as we know it. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19. Furthermore, results of this study will also offer valuable insights for researchers who aim to develop interventions for cancer caregivers in the context of COVID-19. In addition, we also expect to be able to identify areas for improvement that need to be addressed in order for health experts to more adequately help cancer caregivers weather the storm of global health crises like COVID-19 and beyond.

Suture-associated surgical site infection (SSI) may develop when bacterial contaminants colonize the suture surface and establish biofilms that are highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. The outcome of SSI affects postoperative care, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and increased financial burden. Antimicrobial sutures coated with antiseptics such as triclosan and chlorhexidine have been used to minimize the occurrence of SSI. However, as the efficacy of antiseptic-based sutures may be affected due to the emergence of resistant strains, new approaches for the development of alternative antimicrobial sutures are necessary. This review provides an update and outlook of various approaches in the design and development of antimicrobial sutures.

It is not yet fully known which symptoms of the disease are most commonly presented in patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Our aim was to investigate the profile of patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation;what symptoms they had during the acute phase of the disease and what symptoms were still present at the start of pulmonary rehabilitation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study included ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID patients who attended standard, in person pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients had COVID-19 disease at least four weeks before attending pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients completed questionnaires of self-reported somatic deficits during acute and post-COVID-19 stage as well as questionnaires regarding their psychological symptoms. Pulmonary function test, expiratory and inspiratory muscle strenght, hand grip strenght and six-minute walk test was performed prior and after pulmonary rehabilitation. RESULTS: Study included 63 patients (32 male, 31 female), with mean age of 52.9 years. During acute COVID-19, majority of patients complained of fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and headache. More than 85% of patients reported pulmonary deficits during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID-19 stage. Emotional distress and anxiety levels were significantly elevated in acute stage, while depression, anger and the need for help was not significantly elevated. All reported symptoms were significantly reduced in post-COVID-19 stage. There was statistically significant difference in six-minute walk distance, inspiratory and expiratory muscle strenght and hand grip strenght between first and final testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results of our study are similar with previous studies, the most common symptoms during acute phase were fatigue, cough and dyspnea and fatigue and respiratory problems during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID stage. Emotional distress diminishes signifiacantly in post-COVID stage.

Immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. The microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. However, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. Potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four Danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. Furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for E. coli, C. perfringens and C. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. However, Enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. Furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. These bacteria were identified as E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. These bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.","output":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A severe complication of spinal cord injury is loss of bladder function (neurogenic bladder), which is characterized by loss of bladder sensation and voluntary control of micturition (urination), and spontaneous hyperreflexive voiding against a closed sphincter (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia). A sacral anterior root stimulator at low frequency can drive volitional bladder voiding, but surgical rhizotomy of the lumbosacral dorsal roots is needed to prevent spontaneous voiding and dyssynergia. However, rhizotomy is irreversible and eliminates sexual function, and the stimulator gives no information on bladder fullness. We designed a closed-loop neuroprosthetic interface that measures bladder fullness and prevents spontaneous voiding episodes without the need for dorsal rhizotomy in a rat model. To obtain bladder sensory information, we implanted teased dorsal roots (rootlets) within the rat vertebral column into microchannel electrodes, which provided signal amplification and noise suppression. As long as they were attached to the spinal cord, these rootlets survived for up to 3 months and contained axons and blood vessels. Electrophysiological recordings showed that half of the rootlets propagated action potentials, with firing frequency correlated to bladder fullness. When the bladder became full enough to initiate spontaneous voiding, high-frequency/amplitude sensory activity was detected. Voiding was abolished using a high-frequency depolarizing block to the ventral roots. A ventral root stimulator initiated bladder emptying at low frequency and prevented unwanted contraction at high frequency. These data suggest that sensory information from the dorsal root together with a ventral root stimulator could form the basis for a closed-loop bladder neuroprosthetic.","output":"A microchannel neuroprosthesis for bladder control after spinal cord injury in rat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: Neonatal brain monitoring is increasingly used due to reports of brain injury perioperatively. Little is known about the effect of sedatives (midazolam) and anesthetics (sevoflurane) on cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) and cerebral activity. This study aims to determine these effects in the perioperative period. Methods: This is an observational, prospective study in two tertiary pediatric surgical centers. All neonates with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia received perioperative cerebral oxygenation and activity measurements. Patients were stratified based on intraoperatively administrated medication: the sevoflurane group (continuous sevoflurane, bolus fentanyl, bolus rocuronium) and the midazolam group (continuous midazolam, continuous fentanyl, and continuous vecuronium). Results: Intraoperatively, rScO2 was higher in the sevoflurane compared to the midazolam group (84%, IQR 77-95 vs. 65%, IQR 59-76, p = < 0.001), fractional tissue oxygen extraction was lower (14%, IQR 5-21 vs. 31%, IQR 29-40, p = < 0.001), the duration of hypoxia was shorter (2%, IQR 0.4-9.6 vs. 38.6%, IQR 4.9-70, p = 0.023), and cerebral activity decreased more: slow delta: 2.16 vs. 4.35 V 2 (p = 0.0049), fast delta: 0.73 vs. 1.37 V 2 (p = < 0.001). In the first 30 min of the surgical procedure, a 3-fold increase in fast delta (10.48-31.22 V 2) and a 5-fold increase in gamma (1.42-7.58 V 2) were observed in the midazolam group. Conclusion: Sevoflurane-based anesthesia resulted in increased cerebral oxygenation and decreased cerebral activity, suggesting adequate anesthesia. Midazolam-based anesthesia in neonates with a more severe CDH led to alarmingly low rScO2 values, below hypoxia threshold, and increased values of EEG power during the first 30 min of surgery.

The prolonged stay-at-home process created some unfavourable effects like unhealthy lifestyle, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour especially in patients with cardiovascular risk. Hypertensive individuals are also affected in the pandemic because of limited access to healthcare services, screening, and altered lifestyles. We aimed to investigate physical activity (PA) level, sedentary behaviour, mental health and healthy lifestyle behaviours in patients with hypertension and compare these parameters with healthy controls. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 40 hypertensive and 40 age-sex matched healthy controls. We assessed PA with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire long-form, quality of life with Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, anxiety and depression with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and lifestyle behaviours with Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile Scale-II (HPLP-II). Moderate and vigorous PA levels of hypertensives were statistically lower than healthy controls (P = 0.001; P = 0.003, respectively). Hypertensive patients exhibited lower SF-36 physical function (P = 0.001), energy/vitality (P = 0.042), body pain scores than those of healthy controls (P = 0.007). Although HADS-anxiety, depression scores were similar (P > 0.05), the depression ratio (45%) was more common in the hypertensive group during the lockdown. The main findings are that hypertensive patients have lower PA levels and worse quality of life than healthy controls during the pandemic. In addition, the presence of depression is more common among hypertensive patients.

True T-cell cross-reactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We used the ViraFEST platform to identify T cell responses cross-reactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC cross-reactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system. RESULTS Memory CD4+ T-cell clonotypes that cross-recognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Cross-reactive T-cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to mono-specific CD4+ T-cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS CoV-2 relative to CCC. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, our data confirm the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes cross-recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of cross-reactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that pre-existing CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern. Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon / (IFN-/) receptor (IFNAR(?/?)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections. Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals. Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance. Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections. A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(?/?) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(?/?) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host. Therefore, IFNAR(?/?) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-assessment questionnaires were completed by HCWs who worked from March 1 to April 30, 2020, in our 16-bed neurological ICU at La Piti-Salptrire Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID ICU. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis in Paris: A differential psychological impact between regular intensive care unit staff members and reinforcement workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent letter published in the Ear, Nose & Throat Journal called attention to the hypothesis that the xerostomia reported in patients with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurs due to the neuroinvasive and neurotropism potential of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Such situations might exacerbate workplace violence (WPV) against physicians, as has been reported in several parts of the world. METHODS: To identify the frequency and characteristics of WPV suffered by physicians attending COVID-19 patients in Peru, a descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with an online survey of 200 physicians. RESULTS: Of the survey respondents, 84.5% had suffered some type of WPV; 97.6% of these suffered nonphysical violence. Suffering more than one incident of violence was reported by 75.7% of respondents. The primary aggressor was a patient's family member or caregiver. Violence occurred most frequently in critical areas inside the health service facility, such as COVID-19 triage, tents, and hospital units, although it also occurred during teleconsultations. Multiple shortcomings of the health services were perceived as the main trigger of violence. Being a female physician (odds ratio [OR]a?=a?2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]a?=a?1.06-5.83) and working in a COVID-19 ICU (ORa?=a?5.84, 95% CIa?=a?1.60-21.28) were the main factors associated with WPV.

For example, TPC2(-/-) mice show defects in cholesterol degradation, leading to hypercholesterinemia; TPC2 absence also results in mature-onset obesity, and a role in glucagon secretion and diabetes has been proposed. Infections with bacterial toxins or viruses e.g., cholera toxin or Ebola virus result in reduced infectivity rates in the absence of TPC2 or after pharmacological blockage, and TPC2(-/-) cancer cells lose their ability to migrate and metastasize efficiently. Finally, melanin production is affected by changes in hTPC2 activity, resulting in pigmentation defects and hair color variation. Here, we analyzed several publicly available genome variation data sets and identified multiple variations in the TPC2 protein in distinct human populations. Surprisingly, one variation, L564P, was found to be the predominant TPC2 isoform on a global scale. By applying endo-lysosomal patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that L564P is a prerequisite for the previously described M484L gain-of-function effect that is associated with blond hair. Additionally, other gain-of-function variants with distinct geographical and ethnic distribution were discovered and functionally characterized. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies was performed, finding the polymorphisms to be associated with both distinct and overlapping traits. In sum, we present the first systematic analysis of variations in TPC2. We functionally characterized the most common variations and assessed their association with various disease traits. With TPC2 emerging as a novel drug target for the treatment of various diseases, this study provides valuable insights into ethnic and geographical distribution of TPC2 polymorphisms and their effects on channel activity.","output":"Human genome diversity data reveal that L564P is the predominant TPC2 variant and a prerequisite for the blond hair associated M484L gain-of-function effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) causes community-acquired pneumonia affecting mainly children, and tends to produce cyclic outbreaks. The widespread use of macrolides is increasing resistance rates to these antibiotics. Molecular tools can help in diagnosis, typing and resistance detection, leading to better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the MP genotypes and resistance pattern circulating in our area while comparing serological and molecular diagnosis of MP. METHODS: Molecular and serological diagnosis of MP was performed in 821 samples collected in Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) from 2013 to 2017. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and macrolide resistance detection by pyrosequencing were performed in those cases positive by PCR. Presence of respiratory viruses and relevant clinical data were also recorded. RESULTS: MP was detected in 16.8% of cases by PCR, with an overall agreement with serology of 76%. Eleven different MLVA types were identified, with 4-5-7-2 (50.1%) and 3-5-6-2 (29.2%) being the most abundant, with the latter showing a seasonal increase during the study. A total of 8% of the strains harboured a point substitution associated with macrolide resistance, corresponding mainly to an A2063G 23S rRNA mutation and directly related to previous macrolide therapy. Analysis of respiratory viruses showed viral coinfections in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serological and molecular tools combined could improve MP diagnosis and the analysis of its infection patterns. Macrolide resistance is associated with previous therapy.

In connection with the Ebola epidemic in the West African countries, including the Republic of Guinea, a failure in implementing measles immunization program was noted. A proportion of measles seronegative subjects in 2017 was 52.4% of total examined individuals. In 2018, a high proportion of measles cases among children aged 1C5 years (61.6%) was identified. In order to stop the 2018 outbreak, the Supplemental Immunization Campaign was conducted in the Konakri and Nzerekore prefectures in the Republic of Guinea. The aim of this study was to examine the 2019C2020 measles epidemic situation and assess the measles population immunity in the Republic of Guinea. Materials and methods. Measles-specific antibodies were examined in 1697 blood serum samples collected from residents of different regions of the Republic of Guinea, aged from 7 months to 76 years, obtained in 2019C2020, and tested retrospectively. The ELISA test systems Anti-Measles Virus ELISA (IgM) Euroimmun and Anti-Measles Virus ELISA (IgG) Euroimmun (Germany) were used. The presence of serum IgM measles antibodies was considered as acute measles infection. Statistical analysis was performed using the software package Statistica 6.0. Results. Blood sera (n = 638) were tested for IgM-measles, and in 46.6% of cases the diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory tests. The biggest proportion of the total cases (61.6%) was found in children aged 1C4 years. The second most important age group was 5C9 years of age, the third is children under 1 year: 18.5% and 11.8% of the total number of patients, respectively. Measles infection was registered in vaccinated patients in 7.4% of the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases. 1059 subjects were examined for IgG measles antibody. The lowest seroprevalence rate was found among children under 4 years of age (47.8%). The highest (85.5%) was found among subjects of 40 years old and older. Conclusion. Measles in GR remains a poorly controlled infection. As in the previous years of observation (2017C2018), children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable cohort of the population, despite the 2018 DI campaign conducted in a number of GR territories. More problems with the measles control in the Republic of Guinea are expected in the period from 2021, as along with the COVID-19 epidemic, Ebola is repeatedly registered in the country.

In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death.

However, tissue culture conditions can be a source of abiotic stress for plants, leading to changes in the DNA sequence and methylation patterns. Despite the growing evidence on biochemical processes affected by abiotic stresses, how these altered biochemical processes affect DNA sequence and methylation patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, the methylation-sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (metAFLP) approach was used to investigate de novo methylation, demethylation, and sequence variation in barley regenerants derived by anther culture. Additionally, we used Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the spectral features of regenerants, which were then analyzed by mediation analysis. The infrared spectrum ranges (710-690 and 1010-940 cm-1) identified as significant in the mediation analysis were most likely related to ?-glucans, cellulose, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Additionally, the identified compounds participated as predictors in moderated mediation analysis, explaining the role of demethylation of CHG sites (CHG_DMV) in in vitro tissue culture-induced sequence variation, depending on the duration of tissue culture. The data demonstrate that ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is a useful tool for studying the biochemical compounds that may affect DNA methylation patterns and sequence variation, if combined with quantitative characteristics determined using metAFLP molecular markers and mediation analysis.

Israel, similar to all other nations, was forced to cope with the unknown. \\"Flattening the curve\\" of infections has become a common term among specialists and decision makers, while explaining restricting measurements taken toward the population. Israelis, who had previously learned to deal with life under constant security threat, are now facing a new reality. The purpose of the study was to check how Israelis are psychologically affected by and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 925 Israelis divided into three groups: ages 18-29, 30-59, and 60-88. The data were collected between March 31 and April 8, 2020, when it was already clear that this is a global plague, the country's borders were closed, and the government's directive for citizens was to remain at home while imposing limitations on the public and private sectors. The current study examined psychological distress among the three age groups as well as the associations between levels of distress, resilience, and coping strategies. Levels of distress were measured via the BSI-18 that measures anxiety, depression, and somatization. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson CD-RISC scale. Coping was measured by the short version of the COPE. Psychological distress was associated with being in a younger age group, being a woman, having economic concerns, use of emotion and problem focused coping, and lower resilience. The study also found that concern for the health of family members was the strongest concern among all age groups but was highest among the younger age group. It was also found that those in the younger age group suffered from higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization compared to the older age group. The middle age group suffered from elevated levels of anxiety and somatization compared to the older age group. Although the older age group was the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, in this study age was found to be a protective factor from psychological distress. The results of the study suggest the need to consider the younger age group as a risk group, which hence needs to be addressed as the focus of intervention programs. It appears that the concern for their loved ones takes a heavy toll on the younger generation, and this should be considered a major source of stress.","output":"Mental Health and Coping in the Shadow of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Israeli Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is necessary to reflect on the question, How to prepare for medical education after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

METHODS: The evaluation used a mixed-methods retrospective pre-post design involving surveys and review of documents such as teams final reports. Online surveys collecting both quantitative and qualitative data were deployed at four time points (after both workshops, 6 months into implementation, and at the end of the 2-year funded projects) to measure KT capacity (knowledge, skills, and confidence) and impact on practice change. Qualitative data was analyzed using a general inductive approach and quantitative data was analyzed using non-parametric statistics. RESULTS: Participants reported statistically significant increases in knowledge and confidence across both workshops, at the 6-month mark of their projects, and at the end of their projects. In addition, at the 6-month check-in, practitioners reported statistically significant improvements in their ability to implement practice changes. In the first cohort of the program, of the teams who were able to complete their projects, half were able to show demonstrable practice changes. CONCLUSIONS: The KT Challenge was successful in improving the capacity of HCPs to implement evidence-based practice changes and has begun to show demonstrable improvements in a number of practice areas. The program is relevant to a variety of HCPs working in diverse practice settings and is relatively inexpensive to implement. Like all practice improvement programs in health care settings, a number of challenges emerged stemming from the high turnover of staff and the limited capacity of some practitioners to take on anything beyond direct patient care. Efforts to address these challenges have been added to subsequent cohorts of the program and ongoing evaluation will examine if they are successful.

The identity of the cell lineages that underpin the infection-associated loss of olfaction could be critical for the clinical management of 2019-nCoV-infected individuals. Recent research has confirmed the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) as key host-specific cellular moieties responsible for the cellular entry of the virus. Accordingly, the ongoing medical examinations and the autopsy reports of the deceased individuals indicate that organs/tissues with high expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other putative viral entry-associated genes are most vulnerable to the infection. We studied if anosmia in 2019-nCoV-infected individuals can be explained by the expression patterns associated with these host-specific moieties across the known olfactory epithelial cell types, identified from a recently published single-cell expression study. Our findings underscore selective expression of these viral entry-associated genes in a subset of sustentacular cells (SUSs), Bowman's gland cells (BGCs) and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium. Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and protein-protein interaction among the host and viral proteins elected regulatory cytoskeleton protein-enriched SUSs as the most vulnerable cell type of the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, expression, structural and docking analyses of ACE2 revealed the potential risk of olfactory dysfunction in four additional mammalian species, revealing an evolutionarily conserved infection susceptibility.

DESIGN Taking advantage of conditional GGTase and RAC1 knockout mice in intestinal epithelial cells (Pggt1b iIEC and Rac1 iIEC mice), intravital microscopy, immunostaining, mechanobiology, organoid techniques and RNA sequencing, we analysed cell shedding alterations within the intestinal epithelium. Moreover, we examined human gut tissue and intestinal organoids from patients with IBD for cell shedding alterations and RAC1 function. RESULTS Epithelial Pggt1b deletion led to cytoskeleton rearrangement and tight junction redistribution, causing cell overcrowding due to arresting of cell shedding that finally resulted in epithelial leakage and spontaneous mucosal inflammation in the small and to a lesser extent in the large intestine. Both in vivo and in vitro studies (knockout mice, organoids) identified RAC1 as a GGTase target critically involved in prenylation-dependent cytoskeleton dynamics, cell mechanics and epithelial cell shedding. Moreover, inflamed areas of gut tissue from patients with IBD exhibited funnel-like structures, signs of arrested cell shedding and impaired RAC1 function. RAC1 inhibition in human intestinal organoids caused actin alterations compatible with arresting of cell shedding. CONCLUSION Impaired epithelial RAC1 function causes cell overcrowding and epithelial leakage thus inducing chronic intestinal inflammation.

The study was conducted at 2 sites (Paris, France, and Beirut, Lebanon), followed the same training and testing protocols, and involved six detection dogs (three explosive detection dogs, one search and rescue dog, and two colon cancer detection dogs). A total of 177 individuals were recruited for the study (95 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 82 asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals) from five hospitals, and one underarm sweat sample per individual was collected. The dog training sessions lasted between one and three weeks. Once trained, the dog had to mark the COVID-19 positive sample randomly placed behind one of three or four olfactory cones (the other cones contained at least one COVID-19 negative sample and between zero and two mocks). During the testing session, a COVID-19 positive sample could be used up to a maximum of three times for one dog. The dog and its handler were both blinded to the COVID-positive sample location. The success rate per dog (i.e., the number of correct indications divided by the number of trials) ranged from 76% to 100%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated success rate was most of the time higher than the success rate obtained by chance after removing the number of mocks from calculations. These results provide some evidence that detection dogs may be able to discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. However, due to the limitations of this proof-of-concept study (including using some COVID-19 samples more than once and potential confounding biases), these results must be confirmed in validation studies.","output":"Can the detection dog alert on COVID-19 positive persons by sniffing axillary sweat samples?

Telemedicine allows clinicians to connect virtually with patients using digital tools. Effective virtual communication or webside manner may require modifications to traditional bedside manner. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the experiences of telemedicine providers with patient-to-provider virtual visits and communication with families at a single large-volume childrens hospital to inform program development and training for future clinicians. METHODS: A total of 2 focus groups of pediatric clinicians (N=11) performing virtual visits before the COVID-19 pandemic, with a range of experiences and specialties, were engaged to discuss experiential, implementation, and practice-related issues. Focus groups were facilitated using a semistructured guide covering general experience, preparedness, rapport strategies, and suggestions. Sessions were digitally recorded, and the corresponding transcripts were reviewed for data analysis. The transcripts were coded based on the identified main themes and subthemes. On the basis of a higher-level analysis of these codes, the study authors generated a final set of key themes to describe the collected data. RESULTS: Theme consistency was identified across diverse participants, although individual clinician experiences were influenced by their specialties and practices. A total of 3 key themes emerged regarding the development of best practices, barriers to scalability, and establishing patient rapport. Issues and concerns related to privacy were salient across all themes. Clinicians felt that telemedicine required new skills for patient interaction, and not all were comfortable with their training. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine provides benefits as well as challenges to health care delivery. In interprofessional focus groups, pediatric clinicians emphasized the importance of considering safety and privacy to promote rapport and webside manner when conducting virtual visits. The inclusion of webside manner instructions within training curricula is crucial as telemedicine becomes an established modality for providing health care.","output":"Pediatric Clinicians Use of Telemedicine: Qualitative Interview Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented scientific response worldwide, with the generation of vast amounts of publicly available epidemiological, biological and clinical data.

In gramineous crops, the process of flowering, which includes the actions of both glume opening and glume closing, is directly driven by the swelling and withering of lodicules due to the water flow into and out of lodicule cells. All these processes are considered to be controlled by aquaporins, which are the essential transmembrane proteins that facilitate the transport of water and other small molecules across the biological membranes. In the present study, the evolution of aquaporins and their contribution to flowering process in plants were investigated via an integration of genome-wide analysis and gene expression profiling. Across the barley genome, we found that HvTIP1;1, HvTIP1;2, HvTIP2;3, and HvPIP2;1 were the predominant aquaporin genes in lodicules and significantly upregulated in responding to glume opening and closing, suggesting the importance of them in the flowering process of barley. Likewise, the putative homologs of the above four aquaporin genes were also abundantly expressed in lodicules of the other monocots like rice and maize and in petals of eudicots like cotton, tobacco, and tomato. Furthermore, all of them were mostly upregulated in responding to the process of floret opening, indicating a conserved function of these aquaporin proteins in plant flowering. The phylogenetic analysis based on the OneKP database revealed that the homologs of TIP1;1, TIP1;2, TIP2;3, and PIP2;1 were highly conserved during the evolution, especially in the angiosperm species, in line with their conserved function in controlling the flowering process. Taken together, it could be concluded that the highly evolutionary conservation of TIP1;1, TIP1;2, TIP2;3 and PIP2;1 plays important roles in the flowering process for both monocots and eudicots.","output":"Highly Conserved Evolution of Aquaporin PIPs and TIPs Confers Their Crucial Contribution to Flowering Process in Plants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the results of testing health care workers, from a tertiary care hospital in Japan that had experienced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak during the first peak of the pandemic, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody seroconversion. Using two chemiluminescent immunoassays and a confirmatory surrogate virus neutralization test, serological testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses (27/64 cases) occurred when case detection relied solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Our results suggest that the NAAT-positive population is only the tip of the iceberg and the portion left undetected might potentially have led to silent transmissions and triggered the spread. A questionnaire-based risk assessment was further indicative of exposures to specific aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., noninvasive ventilation and airway suctioning) having mediated transmission and served as the origins of the outbreak. Our observations are supportive of a multitiered testing approach, including the use of serological diagnostics, in order to accomplish exhaustive case detection along the whole COVID-19 spectrum. IMPORTANCE We describe the results of testing frontline health care workers, from a hospital in Japan that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Antibody testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses occurred when case detection relied solely on PCR-based viral detection. COVID-19 clusters have been continuously striking the health care system around the globe. Our findings illustrate that such clusters are lined with hidden infections eluding detection with diagnostic PCR and that the cluster burden in total is more immense than actually recognized. The mainstays of diagnosing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, generally consist of two approaches, one aiming to detect molecular fragments of the invading pathogen and the other to measure immune responses of the host. Considering antibody testing as one trustworthy option to test our way through the pandemic can aid in the exhaustive case detection of COVID-19 patients with variable presentations.","output":"Serological Testing Reveals the Hidden COVID-19 Burden among Health Care Workers Experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 Nosocomial Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs.

The evidence base shows that intervention for children with SSD is more effective and efficient when provided intensively in relation to the number of target sounds elicited in sessions (dose) and number of sessions per week (frequency). Southern Health and Social Care (HSC) Trust's baseline intensity of speech and language therapy (SLT) intervention was similar to that often found in current practice across the UK, where ~30 target sounds were elicited (dose) in once weekly sessions (frequency) over a 6-week block, followed by a break from therapy. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to increase intensity of intervention for children with severe SSD within Southern HSC Trusts community SLT service to improve outcomes for children and their parents. QI methods supported accurate identification of ten 4C5 year olds with severe SSD and increased the intensity of their intervention over a 12-week period by measuring a range of data and speech outcomes. Findings showed a sustainable increase of dose (number of targets elicited per session) to levels recommended in the research (70). However, it was difficult to sustain increased frequency of appointments (to twice weekly) because of contextual factors such as sickness, etc. Accommodating this, measuring days between appointments captured an overall increase in the number of appointments attended across time.

This setting is impractical in early success prediction as the performance of a student is only known at the end of the course. In this paper, we aim to create early success prediction models that can be transferred between MOOCs from different domains and topics. To do so, we present three novel strategies for transfer: 1) pre-training a model on a large set of diverse courses, 2) leveraging the pre-trained model by including meta information about courses, and 3) fine-tuning the model on previous course iterations. Our experiments on 26 MOOCs with over 145,000 combined enrollments and millions of interactions show that models combining interaction data and course information have comparable or better performance than models which have access to previous iterations of the course.

We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess the risk of bias in studies. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and new renal replacement therapy (RRT). RESULTS: A total of 35,456 patients from eight studies were included. There was no significant difference between balanced crystalloid solutions and saline in mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.92C1.01).

In studies that allowed concomitant OA medications, diacerein was associated with significantly more dermatological disorders (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.42-4.31; I2 = 0%) and more dropouts due to AEs (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.85-5.47; I2 = 13.4%) than was placebo. No significant increase in serious or severe AEs was found with diacerein versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS GS and CS can be considered safe treatments for patients with OA. All eligible studies on ASU included in our analysis used the proprietary product Piascledine? and allowed other anti-OA medications; thus, the safety of ASU must be confirmed in future studies without concomitant anti-OA medications. Given the safety concerns with diacerein, its usefulness in patients with OA should be assessed, taking into account individual patient characteristics.","output":"Safety of Symptomatic Slow-Acting Drugs for Osteoarthritis: Outcomes of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pandemics can increase disease spread, as well as unpredictable and highly in patient demand, which can have a negative impact on hospital capacity and the overall functioning of the health-care system. The preparedness and capacity of intensive care services to respond to COVID-19 in Indonesia are remain unknown. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the preparedness and capacity of intensive care services in Indonesia to respond to the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A mixed-method research design was used in this study using in-depth interviews and an online survey. An in-depth interview was conducted with the medical team (intensive care consultant and an anesthesiologist) who is actively involved in the provision of COVID-19 services in 15 national referral hospitals. The online survey was conducted to all medical teams that provide direct care to the COVID-19 patients. A total of 459 (response rate was 95.2%) agreed to join the survey. The content analysis technique was used to analyze qualitative data and a descriptive analysis was used to describe issues encountered in providing health services to COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The analysis preparedness and capacity of intensive care service in Indonesia to respond to the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in 4 themes with 12 sub-themes. The four themes were limited quality and quantity of standardized intensive care unit (ICU) isolation room (inadequate zoning systems, adequacy of the standardized ICU isolation room, the readiness of the hospital infrastructure, and telemedicine facilities are not yet widely used, including in the COVID-19 isolation room), limited medical service support (lack of personal protective equipment (personal protective equipment [PPE], re-used PPE, lack of availability of medical devices), limitations in the medical teams quality and quantity management (lack of number and distribution of expert doctors and medical team screening for ICU), and command systems (task shifting, effective communication, and leadership). CONCLUSION: Medical team encounters several difficulties, particularly related to the quality of facilities, staff preparedness, and systems for the provision of services to COVID-19 patients with critical conditions. There is a critical need for well-defined pathways, legal protection, and occupational health for medical teams providing services in the aftermath of a pandemic.","output":"What is preparedness and capacity of intensive care service in indonesia to response to covid-19?

The present study aims to (1) evaluate the accuracy and usability of the RAE system and (2) evaluate the impact of RAE on patient centered outcomes. METHODS: The first phase of the study will be an observational trial of N = 50 participants in outpatient treatment for SUD using the RAE system for 30 days. Accuracy of craving and stress detection algorithms will be evaluated, and usability of RAE will be explored via semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with SUD treatment clinicians. The second phase of the study will be a randomized controlled trial of RAE vs usual care to evaluate rates of return to use, retention in treatment, and quality of life. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The RAE platform is a potentially powerful tool to de-escalate stress and craving outside of the clinical milieu, and to connect with a support system needed most.

One major impact has been underutilization of traditional healthcare services by patients. In 2020, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) started offering general COVID-19 enquiries, education, and medical and psychological consultations around the clock via their 937-Call Center. Given this major change, there was a need to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Call Center services, specifically medical consultations, to suggest future recommendations for patient care optimization. This descriptive study analyzed routinely collected data on the 937-Call Center service between March 2020 and September 2020. Data were reviewed, coded, verified, and analyzed using SPSS v22. There was a 296% increase in the number of calls received by the 937-Call Center in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The majority of calls received in 2020 were general medical enquiries (98.41%), but about three million COVID-19-specific enquiries were also received in 2020. The increased number of calls was managed by accepting volunteers to handle calls: an average of 236 volunteers per month, handling about 20% of the total call volume. The majority of volunteers were physicians but with the presence of pharmacists, psychologists, and specialized healthcare workers such as nutritionists. Utilization of the 937-Call Center increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that it has been an effective strategy for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

Inflammatory cytokine production constitutes a hallmark of COVID-19 that is facilitated by inability of adaptive immunity to control virus invasion. The effect of cytokine release syndrome is deleterious, but the severity of it depends on other confounding factors: age and comorbidities. In this study, we analyze the literature data on the post-transplant course of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanted (alloHSCT) patients, which is affected by generated inflammatory cytokines. The sequence of events boosting cytokine production was analyzed in relation to clinical and laboratory data highlighting the impact of cytokine generation on the post-transplant course. The collected data were compared to those from studies on COVID-19 patients. The similarities are: (i) the damage/pathogen-associated molecular pattern (DAMP/PAMP) stage is similar except for the initiation hit being sterile in alloHSCT (toxic damage of conditioning regimen) and viral in COVID-19; (ii) genetic host-derived factors play a role; (iii) adaptive immunity fails, DAMP signal(s) increases, over-production of cytokines occurs; (iv) monocytes lacking HLADR expression emerge, being suppressor cells hampering adaptive immunity; (v) immune system homeostasis is broken, the patient's status deteriorates to bed dependency, leading to hypo-oxygenation and malnutrition, which in turn stimulates the intracellular alert pathways with vigorous transcription of cytokine genes. All starts with the interaction between DAMPs with appropriate receptors, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the inflammatory process spreads, tissue is damaged, DAMPs are released and a vicious cycle occurs. Attempts to modify intracellular signaling pathways in patients with post-alloHSCT graft vs host disease have already been undertaken.

It plays many essential roles in the medical field including clinical forecasting, visualization, and even automated diagnostics. This paper focuses on the future prediction of COVID-19 vaccination rates in different countries. Considering how destructive the novel Coronavirus has been and its continuous mutation and spread, clinical interventions such as vaccines serve as a ray of hope for many individuals. As of 2021, an estimated total of 8,687,201,202 vaccine doses by numerous biopharmaceutical manufacturers have been administered worldwide [1]. This study intends to estimate the probable increase or decrease in global vaccination rates, as well as analyze the correlation between future trends of daily vaccinations and new COVID-19 cases, along with deaths and reproduction rates. Three models were utilized in forecasting and comparing the overall prediction toward the COVID19 vaccine rates;Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), an ML approach, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), an artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Prophet which is based on an additive model. The Vector Autoregression (VAR) model will also be utilized to compare COVID-19 cases, deaths and reproduction rates to that of COVID-19 vaccine growth. ARIMA resulted to be the best model, while Prophet turned out to be the worst-performing model. In general, our comparison of employing the ARIMA model vs the other three results in the conclusion that adopting this method shows to be a more effective approach in projecting vaccination growth in the future.

In some coronaviruses, this occurs primarily at the cell surface, while in others primarily in endosomes. Prior data on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that either can happen, depending on cell type, and there has been debate regarding the physiologically relevant mechanism of entry. Here we use single-virus fusion experiments using isolated plasma membrane and exogenously controlled proteases to probe the question of protease activation directly. We find that a broad range of proteases can activate SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses for fusion, that this does not depend on the pseudovirus genetic background, and that the plasma membrane is competent to support fusion. Furthermore, protease activation can occur either prior or subsequent to receptor binding. The resulting data suggest a model of opportunistic fusion by SARS-CoV-2, where the subcellular location of entry depends on airway protease activity, cell-surface protease activity, and endosomal protease activity, but all can support infection. These parallel pathways help explain why targeted host protease inhibition has shown strong efficacy in cell-culture models but weaker efficacy in clinical trials.","output":"Single-virus fusion measurements yield an opportunistic model for SARS-CoV-2 fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a highly pathogenic coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (formerly identified as2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan, China, and has since been spreading rapidly around the world.The most specific manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 patients is pulmonary distress, and several patients admitted to intensive care units were not able to breathe spontaneously.In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has a significant effect on nervous systems and may even lead to serious neurological damage.The neuroinvasive pathobiology is still not fully elucidated and thus the effect of CoV infections on the nervous system needs to be explored.

Rubicon induces antimicrobial responses upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and functions as a feedback inhibitor to prevent unbalanced proinflammatory responses depending on dectin-1 signaling. However, the role played by Rubicon during antiviral immune responses, particularly the type I interferon (IFN) responses, remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Rubicon acts as a negative regulator for virus-triggered IFN signaling. Knockdown of Rubicon promoted type I interferon signaling and inhibited virus replication, while overexpression of Rubicon had the opposite effect. Rubicon specifically interacts with the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain (IAD) of IRF3, and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3, which negatively regulates IFN-mediated antiviral response. Thus, our findings suggest the novel additional role of Rubicon as a negative regulator that inhibits the IFN signaling and cellular antiviral responses, providing a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition.IMPORTANCE The type I IFN system is a critical innate immune response that protects organisms against virus infection. However, type I IFN signaling must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive production of IFNs. Hence, negative regulatory mechanisms for type I IFN signaling are important, and to date, several related molecules have been identified. Here, we show that Rubicon is a major negative regulator of type I IFN signaling, and unlike previous reports of cellular molecules that inhibit IRF3 activation via proteasomal degradation or dephosphorylation of IRF3, we show that Rubicon interacts with IRF3 and that ultimately this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3. Thus, we identified a novel negative regulator of type I IFN signaling pathways and a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the role of negative-feedback mechanisms that regulate type I IFN signaling and maintain immune homeostasis.","output":"Rubicon Modulates Antiviral Type I Interferon (IFN) Signaling by Targeting IFN Regulatory Factor 3 Dimerization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Secondary distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits by patients attending clinic services to their partners could improve the rate of HIV diagnosis. We aimed to investigate whether secondary administration of HIVST kits, with or without an additional financial incentive, via women receiving antenatal care (ANC) or via people newly diagnosed with HIV (ie, index patients) could improve the proportion of male partners tested or the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV. METHODS: We did a three-arm, open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial of 27 health centres (clusters), eligible if they were a government primary health centre providing ANC, HIV testing, and ART services, across four districts of Malawi. We recruited women (aged 18 years) attending their first ANC visit and whose male partner was available, not already taking ART, and not already tested for HIV during this pregnancy (ANC cohort), and people (aged 18 years) with newly diagnosed HIV during routine clinic HIV testing who had at least one sexual contact not already known to be HIV-positive (index cohort). Centres were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a public selection of computer-generated random allocations, to enhanced standard of care (including an invitation for partners to attend HIV testing services), HIVST only, or HIVST plus a US$10 financial incentive for retesting. The primary outcome for the ANC cohort was the proportion of male partners reportedly tested, as ascertained by interview with women in this cohort at day 28. The primary outcome for the index cohort was the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive people identified per facility within 28 days of enrolment, as measured by observed HIV test results. Cluster-level summaries compared intervention with standard of care by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03705611. FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2018, and May 2, 2019, nine clusters were assigned to each trial arm, resulting in 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort (1447 [318%] in the standard care group, 1465 [322%] in the HIVST only group, and 1632 [359%] in HIVST plus financial incentive group) and 708 eligible patients in the index cohort (234 [331%] in the standard care group, 169 [239%] in the HIVST only group, and 305 [429%] in the HIVST plus financial incentive group). 4461 (982%) of 4544 eligible women in the ANC cohort and 645 (911%) of 708 eligible patients in the index cohort were recruited, of whom 3378 (757%) in the ANC cohort and 439 (681%) in the index cohort were interviewed after 28 days. In the ANC cohort, the mean proportion of reported partner testing per cluster was 350% (SD 100) in the standard care group, 730% in HIVST only group (131, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 171, 95% CI 148C198; p<00001), and 652% in the HIVST plus financial incentive group (116, adjusted RR 162, 145C181; p<00001). In the index cohort, the geometric mean number of new HIV-positive sexual partners per cluster was 135 (SD 162) for the standard care group, 191 (178) for the HIVST only group (incidence rate ratio adjusted for number eligible as an offset in the negative binomial model 165, 95% CI 049C555; p=03370), and 320 (381) for the HIVST plus financial incentive group (311, 099C977; p=00440). Four self-resolving, temporary marital separations occurred due to disagreement in couples regarding HIV self-test kits. INTERPRETATION: Although administration of HIVST kits in the ANC cohort, even when offered alongside a financial incentive, did not identify significantly more male patients with HIV than did standard care, out-of-clinic options for HIV testing appear more acceptable to many male partners of women with HIV, increasing test uptake. Viewed in the current context, this approach might allow continuation of services despite COVID-19-related lockdowns.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a promising tool for monitoring fluid status and FO. Therefore, we sought to investigate the efficacy of BIA-directed fluid resuscitation among OA patients. METHODS: A pragmatic, prospective, randomized, observer-blind, single-center trial was performed for all trauma patients requiring OA between January 2013 and December 2017 to a national referral center. A total of 140 postinjury OA patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a BIA-directed fluid resuscitation (BIA) protocol that included fluid administration with monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and different degrees of interventions to achieve a negative fluid balance targeting the hydration level (HL) measured by BIA or a traditional fluid resuscitation (TRD) in which clinicians determined the fluid resuscitation regimen according to traditional parameters during 30 days of ICU management. The primary outcome was the 30-day primary fascial closure (PFC) rate. The secondary outcomes included the time to PFC, postoperative 7-day cumulative fluid balance (CFB) and adverse events within 30 days after OA. The KaplanCMeier method and the log-rank test were utilized for PFC after OA. A generalized linear regression model for the time to PFC and CFB was built. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients completed the trial (BIA, n = 66; TRD, n = 68). The BIA patients were significantly more likely to achieve PFC than the TRD patients (83.33% vs. 55.88%, P < 0.001). In the BIA group, the time to PFC occurred earlier than that of the TRD group by an average of 3.66 days (P < 0.001). Additionally, the BIA group showed a lower postoperative 7-day CFB by an average of 6632.80 ml (P < 0.001) and fewer complications. CONCLUSION: Among postinjury OA patients in the ICU, the use of BIA-guided fluid resuscitation resulted in a higher PFC rate and fewer severe complications than the traditional fluid resuscitation strategy.

These treatments were found to leave no residual toxicity for the wearer, have a relatively short cycle time of less than 1 h, and existing systems can likely be retrofitted to accommodate this method. Further, UVGI (among other treatment methods) has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and respirator manufacturers. Methods involving microwave-generated steam also show potential in that they are likely effective against SARS-CoV-2, preserve performance, have no residual toxicity, require a short duration treatment cycle (often less than 10 min), and microwave ovens are inexpensive and readily available. Steam methods are currently recommended by the CDC, OSHA, and manufacturers. These respirator decontamination methods are likely also useful against other viruses or pathogens.","output":"A critical review of methods for decontaminating filtering facepiece respirators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An individuals outlook on society can change over time and can be related to both their physical and mental health.

The purpose of this study was to describe some aspects of lifestyle, access to health services, and mental wellness of Italian pregnant women and new-mothers during the lockdown. We carried out a web-based survey to assess how pregnant women and new-mothers were coping with the lockdown. Expected outcomes were categorized in different analysis domains: psychological well-being and support, physical exercise, dietary habits, access to care, delivery and obstetric care, neonatal care and breastfeeding.We included 742 respondents (response rate 86.2%), 603 were pregnant (81.3%) and 139 (18.7%) had delivered during lockdown. We found a high score for anxiety and depression in 62.7% of pregnant women and 61.9% of new-mothers. During the lockdown, 61.9% of pregnant women reduced their physical exercise, and 79.8% reported to eat in a healthier way. 94.2% of new-mothers reported to have breastfed their babies during hospital staying. Regarding the impact of restrictive measures on breastfeeding, no impact was reported by 56.1% of new-mothers, a negative impact by 36.7%.The higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women and new-mothers should be a public health issue. Clinicians might also consider to recommend and encourage home physical exercise. On the other hand, most women improved their approach towards healthy eating during the lockdown and a very high breastfeeding rate was reported soon after birth: these data are an interesting starting point to develop new strategies for public health.","output":"A Survey Among Italian Pregnant Women and New-mothers During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Containment measures implemented to minimize the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported to be negatively affecting mental health, diet, and alcohol consumption. These factors, as well as poor cardiometabolic health and insufficient physical and cognitive activity, are known to increase the risk of developing dementia. COVID-19 \\"lockdown\\" measures may have exacerbated these dementia risk factors among people in mid-to-later life. Methods: We compared longitudinal data from before (October 2019) and during (April-June 2020) the first COVID-19 lockdown period in Tasmania, Australia. Participants (n = 1671) were 50+ years of age and engaged in a public health program targeting dementia risk reduction, with one-third participating in the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course (PD-MOOC). Regression models were used to assess changes in smoking, alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), diet, physical exercise, cognitive and social activity, anxiety and depression, and management of cholesterol, diabetes, and blood pressure. Where significant changes were noted, the moderating influence of being in current employment, living with others, and completing the PD-MOOC was tested. Results: Although friend networks contracted marginally during lockdown, no detrimental effects on modifiable dementia risk factors were noted. Anxiety levels and alcohol consumption decreased, there was no change in depression scores, and small but significant improvements were observed in cognitive and physical activity, smoking, diet, and BMI. Stronger improvements in cognitive activity were observed among people who were cohabiting (not living alone) and both cognitive activity and adherence to the MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurological Delay) improved more for people who participated in the PD-MOOC. Discussion: Longitudinal data did not show widespread negative effects of COVID-19 lockdown on modifiable dementia risk factors in this sample. The results counter the dominant narratives of universal pandemic-related distress and suggest that engaging at-risk populations in proactive health promotion and education campaigns during lockdown events could be a protective public health strategy.","output":"Change in modifiable dementia risk factors during COVID-19 lockdown: The experience of over 50s in Tasmania, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A model of the effects of ethnicity, political trust, trust in science, perceived ingroup power, COVID-19 risk and fear of COVID-19 upon likelihood of COVID-19 preventive behaviour (CPB) is presented.

METHODS We developed a multidisciplinary steering committee to uncover barriers to palliative care referral and developed a pilot program, called the Warm Handoff. Through ongoing collaboration and midpilot feedback sessions, we identified several additional barriers and opportunities to increase access to palliative care. RESULTS Clinicians used the initial Warm Handoff process only 20 times over a period of 7 months. Of those calls, 10 were for issues outside of those that the Warm Handoff pilot was intended to address. During the pilot, we identified lack of access to urgent visits and clinician telephone availability for clinical case discussion as additional barriers to access. Increased collaboration led to the creation of a clinical provider of the day (CPOD) care model, which allowed for a notable increase in the capacity to see urgent consults. After this intervention, we observed an average of 19 patients seen urgently per month. In addition, there was a trend toward increasing referrals from breast oncology after the initiation of the CPOD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September-November 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ED leaders across the United States. We identified EDs with pandemic-related telehealth programs through literature review and snowball sampling. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a range of experiences. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: We completed 15 interviews with EDs leaders in 10 states. From March-November 2020, participants experimented with more than a dozen different types of telehealth applications including tele-isolation, tele-triage, tele-consultation, virtual post-discharge assessment, acute care in the home, and tele-palliative care.

We sought to corroborate these findings by examining the prognostic significance of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scanning in the setting of newly diagnosed MM. We retrospectively analyzed 195 patients with a PET/CT available both at diagnosis and at 6 months post-treatment to examine the value of PET/CT results as an adjuvant metric to conventional hematologic responses in terms of time to next treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS). The median TTNT and OS for the entire cohort were 24.6 (95% CI=20.4-29.1) and 79 (95% CI=63.1-119.1) months, respectively. When comparing PET/CT (-) with PET/CT (+) patients, we found significantly prolonged median TTNT (55.2 vs. 17.8 months, p<0.0001) and OS (unreached vs. 60.8 months, p<0.0001) for the PET/CT (-) group. We then examined the additive value of PET/CT on the hematologic response achieved at 6 months, and we found that PET/CT (-) is associated with significantly increased median TTNT and OS for both the very good partial response (VGPR) group and the less than VGPR group. Importantly, PET/CT retained prognostic significance after adjusting for multiple other predictive variables.

Moreover, the ALD-BN exhibits a two-fold increase in carrier mobility of graphene field effect transistors (G-FETs/ALD-BN/SiO2) due to the less surface charge density and inert surface of ALD-BN in comparison to that of G-FETs fabricated on bare SiO2.

Quantitative analysis of these dyes (? 1.5-fold alteration, p ? 0.05) revealed a total of 33 proteoforms identified by MS differing in abundance and/or oxidation upon lidocaine exposure. Network analysis showed enrichment of apoptotic proteins and cell wall maintenance proteins, while the abundance of proteins central to carbohydrate metabolism, such as triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and redox proteins superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin were significantly decreased. Enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate kinase and enolase, the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase, and multiple ATP synthase subunits were found to be oxidatively modified. Also, the activity of aconitase was found to be decreased.

It is one of the RNA coronaviruses which share the highest mutation rates of RNA viruses when compared with that of their hosts. The collective mutation rate of RNA viruses is up to a million times higher than their hosts and is correlated with enhanced virulence of viruses. The RNA, genomic material of SARS-CoV-2, has the capacity of showing amplified fast changes as the infection spreads. These changes were frequently observed in genes for spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, and ORF8, together with RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

Mutated SARS COV-2 at these particular sites has been associated with viral infectivity, false laboratory results and viral genome mutation and interferes with therapeutic targets. Interferences with therapeutic targets is frequently observed in genes for RdRp. Additionally, mutated viral genes for RdRp render slow fidelity of RdRp protein, resulting in a high mutation rate.

The definitions of the terms sex and gender were correctly identified by most respondents (93.1%). However, only 36% (12/33) of questions related to other medical knowledge on SGSH topics had more than a 50% correct response rate. More than half of the students reported that SGSH topics were included in Gynecology, Cardiology, Pediatrics, and Immunology. SGSH topics were reported as not being routinely covered in Neurology and Nephrology, although more students said they were in 2020 then 2012. Sixty-two percent of students favored increasing SGSH in the current curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students appear to understand the definition of and importance of SGSH in education. While some improvements in coverage by subject matter and topic area appear to have occurred as reported by medical students, opportunity remains to more fully integrate SGSH concepts in medical school curricula.

Methods Data from a Chinese multi-institutional registry and the US SEER database on stage I to IIIA resected NSCLC (2001 to 2008) were analyzed for the relationship between the ELN count and stage migration and overall survival (OS) by using multivariable models. The series of the mean positive LNs, odds ratios (ORs), and hazard ratios (HRs) were fitted with a LOWESS smoother, and the structural break points were determined by Chow test. The selected cut point was validated with the SEER 2009 cohort. Results Although the distribution of ELN count differed between the Chinese registry (n = 5,706) and the SEER database (n = 38,806; median, 15 versus seven, respectively), both cohorts exhibited significantly proportional increases from N0 to N1 and N2 disease (SEER OR, 1.038; China OR, 1.012; both P < .001) and serial improvements in OS (N0 disease: SEER HR, 0.986; China HR, 0.981; both P < .001; N1 and N2 disease: SEER HR, 0.989; China HR, 0.984; both P < .001) as the ELN count increased after controlling for confounders. Cut point analysis showed a threshold ELN count of 16 in patients with declared node-negative disease, which were examined in the derivation cohorts (SEER 2001 to 2008 HR, 0.830; China HR, 0.738) and validated in the SEER 2009 cohort (HR, 0.837). Conclusion A greater number of ELNs is associated with more-accurate node staging and better long-term survival of resected NSCLC. We recommend 16 ELNs as the cut point for evaluating the quality of LN examination or prognostic stratification postoperatively for patients with declared node-negative disease.","output":"Impact of Examined Lymph Node Count on Precise Staging and Long-Term Survival of Resected Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Population Study of the US SEER Database and a Chinese Multi-Institutional Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Arab region is highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Local governments have already started to act against the disease. However, only a few countries provided COVID-19 vaccination. Compliance with vaccination is a major topic affecting proper coverage. Thus, we aim to explore vaccine acceptance among Arab populations, and compare it with the global numbers. METHODS: An internet-based survey using social media platforms was conducted, targeting adults who were able to read and understand Arabic, had access to the internet, and from all 22 Arab league countries. Due to the response rate variation between participants, the countries were grouped into four categories based on their income: Low income, Lower-middle income, Upper-middle income, and High-income economies. Data about demographics, previous COVID-19 infection, and vaccine acceptance tendency were collected and analyzed using Chi-squared (2) test and Logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 870 participants completed the survey. 59.3% of the participants were male, 53.3% were between 25 and 44 years, and 69.9% were Arabs who live inside of their home country. The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 62.4%. A significant higher tendency toward vaccination was identified in males (65.4%, P = 0.04) and people living outside their home countries (67.9%, P = 0.02). However, age group, level of education, and previous COVID-19 infection were all factors with insignificant effect. Citizens of High-income countries were more likely to accept the vaccine (70.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Less than two-thirds of Arabs are compliant with COVID-19 vaccination. This proportion is relatively lower than the global rate. It is important to develop strategies to promote vaccine acceptance and reach the ideal coverage needed to achieve efficient immunization.","output":"Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the Arab world: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The limited evidence on neonatal coronavirus disease (COVID-19) suggests that vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rare, and most neonates seem to acquire the infection postnatally through respiratory droplets and contact.

The audio-vestibular system can also be involved, but there is still debate about this so findings need to be considered carefully. Furthermore, mother to fetus intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is controversial. Few studies are available about the audio-vestibular symptomatology of newborns with intrauterine COVID19 exposure. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the possible correlation between the COVID19 gestational infection and hearing impairment onset in newborns. The involvement of hearing in COVID19 is verified so the timing and methodology of audiological evaluation of children can be planned. METHODS: Children were subject to newborn hearing screening and audiological evaluation. Newborn hearing screening is carried out prior to hospital discharge using the Automatic Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions test. Audiological evaluation is performed within the child age of 4 months by using maternal, pregnancy, and perinatal case history, COVID19 case history, otoscopy, acoustic immittance test, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions test, and the Auditory Brainstem Response test. RESULTS: 63 children were included in the study. 82.5% of these children were subjects of the newborn hearing screening program. The remaining 11 newborns were not subjected to hearing screening due to isolation measures and their audiological evaluation was carried out directly. Only one of 52 screened neonates showed a bilateral REFER test result but hearing threshold was normal at audiological evaluation. Audiological evaluation showed normal bilateral ABR thresholds in 59/63 children. Four children (6.3% of the total) had ABR threshold alterations but two showed normal threshold at ABR retest performed within 1 month of the first. The other two infants showed monolateral ABR alterations but one of these had a concomitant middle ear effusion. In conclusion, only one child (1.6% of the sample) had an altered ABR. This child had shown one positive SARS-CoV-2 swab in the absence of risk factors for hearing loss.

Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions. Some changes have had wider benefits such as improved sanitation, better communication and a greater recognition of seasonal worker needs.

A major drawback of AS is the uncertainty whether a patient truly has low risk PC based on biopsy alone. Multiparametric MRI scan together with biopsy, appears useful in separating patients who need curative therapy from those for whom AS may be safe. Two small clinical trials have shown short-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation may prevent PC progression. There is no substantial evidence for its long-term safety and efficacy, hence its use in the care of men with PC on AS needs assessment. This protocol describes the ProsD clinical trial which aims to determine if oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation taken monthly for 2 years can prevent PC progression in cases with low-to-intermediate risk of progression. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This is an Australian national multicentre, 2:1 double-blinded placebo-controlled phase II randomised controlled trial of monthly oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50 000 IU cholecalciferol), in men diagnosed with localised PC who have low-to-intermediate risk of disease progression and are being managed by AS. This trial will assess the feasibility, efficacy and safety of supplementing men with an initial oral loading dose of 500 000 IU cholecalciferol, followed by a monthly oral dose of 50 000 IU during the 24 months of AS. The primary trial outcome is the commencement of active therapy for clinical or non-clinical reason, within 2 years of AS.

A global turbulence such as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on individual companies and entire economic sectors, raising the question of whether a paradigm shift is necessary, in order to enable a new cycle of development that is much environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. This environmental and socio-economic context of profound uncertainty forces organizations to consider more carefully the risk factors affecting their business continuity, as well as how these factors relate to sustainability issues. However, there is a gap in knowledge about how risk management systems relate to sustainability management systems, and how both of them exert influence on business performance, especially from a theoretical point of view. The aim of this study is to address this gap, by developing a new interpretative framework for the analysis of risk management strategies in organizations. This approach has been identified in economic hermeneutics as an innovative methodological tool to improve the knowledge of risk and design the most appropriate management strategies. The paper provides two main results: the first one is the construction of a theoretical model that relates risk management to sustainability management; the second one is an operational framework of multidimensional risk assessment useful for analysis at different levels (business, competitive scenario and system). Finally, the model also makes it possible to carry out a sustainability assessment through risk evaluation in the perspective of the sustainable development goals.","output":"Flexibility and Resilience in Corporate Decision Making: A New Sustainability-Based Risk Management System in Uncertain Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood cancer, or leukemia, has a negative impact on the blood and/or bone marrow of children and adults.

To cope with this pandemic many countries have adopted nationwide lockdowns which restrict nonessential activities and encourage their populations to avoid public transport, work from hone wherever possible, and to maintain social distancing at all times. While the severity of these shutdowns has varied with country, large geographic regions of the world (including China, India, Iran, Italy, Spain, and the USA) have all been severely affected, not just in the loss of human life, but also in terms of the financial impacts the lockdowns will have on their countries future prosperityIt was previously reported that a number of environmental factors, including humidity and temperature, played an important role in development and spread of the SARS-Corona Virus infection with the virus retaining viability for over 5 days at temperatures between 22C25oC and relative humidity (RH) of 40C50%. Whereas, elevated temperatures and higher RH (38oC, and >95% RH) decreased virus viability (Kroumpouzos et al., 2020). The spread of COVID-19 started in low temperature areas of China, with major outbreaks subsequently occurring in Iran, Japan, Northern Italy and South Korea. These new virus epicenters all had similar temperature and latitude, along the 30-50?Nzone. Subsequently, the virus was spread to regions of elevated temperature, such as India, the Middle East and Thailand, due to international travel (Kroumpouzos et al., 2020).The aim of this study was to consider the environmental impact of COVID-19, including water pollution. The paper is divided into four sections. In the first section the current literature related to COVID-19 is reviewed.

Methods and ResultsIn an all-comer prospective, parallel study, consecutive coronary diagnostic and intervention procedures were performed with the use of standard radiation shield alone (control group) or with the addition of a real-time dosimetry monitoring system (Raysafe, Billdal, Sweden, monitoring group). The primary outcome was the difference in exposure of the primary operator among groups. Additional endpoints included patient, nurse, second operator exposure and fluoroscopy time.

We conducted this study to show the different spectral frequency and time domain parameters of HRV as a prospective predictor for critically ill patients, and in particular for COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that most severely ill COVID-19 patients have a depletion of the sympathetic nervous system and a predominance of parasympathetic activity reflecting the remaining compensatory anti-inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective, observational pilot study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was conducted. The normalized high-frequency component (HFnu), i.e. ANIm, and the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), i.e. Energy, were recorded using the analgesia nociception index monitor (ANI). To estimate the severity and mortality we used the SOFA score and the date of discharge or date of death. RESULTS: A total of fourteen patients were finally included in the study. ANIm were higher in the non-survivor group (p = 0.003) and were correlated with higher IL-6 levels (p = 0.020). Energy was inversely correlated with SOFA (p = 0.039) and fewer survival days (p = 0.046). A limit value at 80 of ANIm, predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7%. In the case of Energy, a limit value of 0.41 ms predicted mortality with all predictive values of 71.4%. CONCLUSION: A low autonomic nervous system activity, i.e. low SDNN or Energy, and a predominance of the parasympathetic system, i.e. low HFnu or ANIm, due to the sympathetic depletion in COVID-19 patients are associated with a worse prognosis, higher mortality, and higher IL-6 levels.","output":"Is the heart rate variability monitoring using the analgesia nociception index a predictor of illness severity and mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19?

Coxiella burnetiiCinduced human Q fever is one of the most widespread neglected zoonosis. The main animal reservoirs responsible for C. burnetii transmission to humans are domesticated ruminants, primarily goats, sheep, and cattle. Although studies are still too sparse to draw definitive conclusions, the most recent C. burnetii serosurvey studies conducted in herds and farms in Africa, North Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and Asia highlighted that seroprevalence was strikingly higher in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) than in other ruminants. The C. burnetii seroprevalence in camel herds can reach more than 60% in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, and 70 to 80% in Algeria and Chad, respectively. The highest seroprevalence was in female camels with a previous history of abortion. Moreover, C. burnetii infection was reported in ticks of the Hyalomma dromedarii and Hyalomma impeltatum species collected on camels. Even if dromedary camels represent <3% of the domesticated ruminants in the countries of the Mediterranean basin Southern coast, these animals play a major socioeconomic role for millions of people who live in the arid zones of Africa, Middle East, and Asia. In Chad and Somalia, camels account for about 7 and 21% of domesticated ruminants, respectively. To meet the growing consumers demand of camel meat and milk (>5 million tons/year of both raw and pasteurized milk according to the Food and Agriculture Organization) sustained by a rapid increase of population (growth rate: 2.26C3.76 per year in North Africa), dromedary camel breeding tends to increase from the Maghreb to the Arabic countries. Because of possible long-term persistence of C. burnetii in camel hump adipocytes, this pathogen could represent a threat for herds and breeding farms and ultimately for public health. Because this review highlights a hyperendemia of C. burnetii in dromedary camels, a proper screening of herds and breeding farms for C. burnetii is urgently needed in countries where camel breeding is on the rise. Moreover, the risk of C. burnetii transmission from camel to human should be further evaluated.","output":"Coxiella burnetii in Dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius): A Possible Threat for Humans and Livestock in North Africa and the Near and Middle East?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim: To investigate the social danger of domestic violence, find out its principal manifestations, consequences, and impact on women and minors' health Based on the acquired knowledge, to suggest ways to overcome this problem, which will minimize the consequences of domestic violence PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The authors studied and analyzed international legal acts, Ukraine's legislation, and scientific publications on domestic violence The method of statistical processing of analytical data of the World Health Organization (hereinafter - WHO), the Institute of Demography and Social Research at the request of the UN Population Fund, the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine (for 2017 - first half of 2020) were used A comparative method of research was useful in comparing the number of cases of domestic violence in Ukraine and Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic CONCLUSION: Conclusion: It is concluded that domestic violence is a socially dangerous act that negatively affects all family members, as it causes significant damage to health and life The most dangerous are the consequences of domestic violence on the physical and mental health of women and minors, who are particularly vulnerable to this negative manifestation Rehabilitation is said to help minimize the effects of domestic violence, restore the physical and mental health of victims, and return them to normal social life","output":"Social Danger of Domestic Violence and the Need for Rehabilitation of Its Victims"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion, with the number of cases as a function of time reasonably well fit by N(t) a?? e&#945;t, in many countries.

To perform a preliminary assessment of the incidence of COVID-19 in IMD patients and the impact of the coronavirus emergency on the rare metabolic community between March and April 2020, the European Reference Network for Hereditary Metabolic Diseases (MetabERN) has performed two surveys: one directed to patients organizations (PO) and one directed to healthcare providers (HCPs). The COVID-19 incidence in the population of rare metabolic patients was lower than that of the general European population (72.9  100,000 vs. 117  100,000). However, patients experienced extensive disruption of care, with the majority of appointments and treatments cancelled, reduced, or postponed. Almost all HCPs (90%) were able to substitute face-to-face visits with telemedicine, about half of patients facing treatment changes switched from hospital to home therapy, and a quarter reported difficulties in getting their medicines. During the first weeks of emergency, when patients and families lacked relevant information, most HCPs contacted their patients to provide them with support and information. Since IMD patients require constant follow-up and treatment adjustments to control their disease and avoid degradation of their condition, the results of our surveys are relevant for national health systems in order to ensure appropriate care for IMD patients. They highlight strong links in an interconnected community of HCPs and PO, who are able to work quickly and effectively together to support and protect fragile persons during crisis. However, additional studies are needed to better appreciate the actual impact of COVID-19 on IMD patients health and the mid- and long-term effects of the pandemic on their wellbeing.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on rare metabolic patients and healthcare providers: results from two MetabERN surveys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to assess the sleep quality, mental health status, and associated factors among medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 \\"overall\\" indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 \\"equity-related\\" indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, \\"D\\") than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, \\"F\\"). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors.

We address this gap drawing on the Human Geography concept of Linked Lives (Coulter et al., Progress in Human Geography, 2016, 40(3), 352C374), to conceive the relocation decisions of residentially mobile individuals, and their place (non)attachment to the current residence place, as deeply intertwined with formative place experiences, interpersonal relations, and the structural contexts within which people live (Coulter et al., Progress in Human Geography, 2016, 40(3), 352C374). With the aim of deepening understanding of the co\\\\evolution of residential mobility and place attachment, this paper presents narrative case studies of residents living in a town in Southwest England, with each resident indicating a different variety of peopleCplace relations to their current residence place. Findings indicate that moving intentions and consequent residential place attachment result from complex interactions over time between (a) formative place experiences and settlement identities, leading to preferred types of residence place;(b) interpersonal relations with significant others including family and community members that vary according to life stage events;and (c) structural forces, comprising cultural, economic, and political factors shaping people's lives.

The main goal of the E2R Methodology is to present clear and easily understood documents. This methodology includes a set of guidelines and recommendations that affect the writing of texts, the supporting images, the design and layout of documents, and the final editing format. Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. The process of adapting existing documents is cyclic and implies three activities: analysis, transformation, and validation. All these activities are human resource consuming, due to the need of involving people with cognitive disabilities as well as E2R experts. In order to alleviate such processes, we are currently investigating the development of methods, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, to perform the analysis and transformation of documents in a (semi)-automatic fashion. In this paper we present our AI-based method for assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines as well as an initial implementation of such a method; our research on the transformation of documents is out of the scope of this paper.

SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cell by the spike protein binding with an ACE2 receptor present on the host cell. Developing safe and effective inhibitor appears an urgent need to interrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptor in order to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have examined the penta-peptide ATN-161 as potential inhibitor of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, where ATN-161 has been commercially approved for the safety and possess high affinity and specificity towards the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We carried out experiments and confirmed these phenomena that the virus bindings were indeed minimized. ATN-161 peptide can be used as an inhibitor of protein-protein interaction (PPI) stands as a crucial interaction in biological systems. The molecular docking finding suggests that the binding energy of the ACE2-spike protein complex is reduced in the presence of ATN-161. Protein-protein docking binding energy (-40.50 kcal/mol) of the spike glycoprotein toward the human ACE2 and binding of ATN-161 at their binding interface reduced the biding energy (-26.25 kcal/mol). The finding of this study suggests that ATN-161 peptide can mask the RBD of the spike protein and be considered as a neutralizing candidate by binding with the ACE2 receptor. Peptide-based masking of spike S1 protein (RBD) and its neutralization is a highly promising strategy to prevent virus penetration into the host cell. Thus masking of the RBD leads to the loss of receptor recognition property which can reduce the chance of infection host cells.","output":"Penta-peptide ATN-161 based neutralization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Terrorism, though not well-defined, is a violent act that has been shown to have longstanding effects on the mental health of those who witness it.

The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold: 1) the estimation of the reproduction number is achieved by convex optimization within a proximal-based inverse problem formulation, with constraints aimed at promoting piecewise smoothness; 2) the approach is developed in a multivariate setting, allowing for the simultaneous handling of multiple time series attached to different geographical regions, together with a spatial (graph-based) regularization of their evolutions in time. The effectiveness of the approach is first supported by simulations, and two main applications to real COVID-19 data are then discussed. The first one refers to the comparative evolution of the reproduction number for a number of countries, while the second one focuses on French departments and their joint analysis, leading to dynamic maps revealing the temporal co-evolution of their reproduction numbers.","output":"Spatial and temporal regularization to estimate COVID-19 reproduction number R(t): Promoting piecewise smoothness via convex optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There exists a compelling need to better understand the temporal dynamics of public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines in the US on a national and state-wise level for facilitating appropriate public policy applications.

Antibody therapy and vaccines both have shown great efficacy in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, whose development progress and adaptation range have attracted wide attention. However, with the emergence of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2, the neutralization activity of therapeutic or vaccine-induced antibodies may be reduced, requiring long-term virus monitoring and drug upgrade in response to its evolution. In this paper, conformational changes including continuous epitopes (CPs), discontinuous epitopes (DPs) and recognition interfaces of the three representative SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) mutants (i.e., the Delta (B.1.617.2), Mu (B.1.621) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) strains), were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of current mainstream antibodies. The results showed that the conformation of SP wild type (WT) and mutants both remained stable, while the local antigenic epitopes underwent significant changes. Sufficient flexibility of SP CPs is critical for effective antibody recognition. The DPs of Delta, Mu and Omicron variants have showed stronger binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) than WT; the possible drug resistance mechanisms of antibodies against three different epitopes (i.e., NTD_DP, RBD1_DP and RBD2_DP) were also proposed, respectively; the RBD2 of Delta, NTD of Mu, NTD and RBD2 of Omicron are deserve more attention in the subsequent design of next-generation vaccines.

Serious games provide an original, engaging, and potentially effective way of disseminating COVID-19 infection prevention and control guidelines. Escape COVID-19 is a serious game for teaching COVID-19 infection prevention and control practices that has previously been validated in a population of nursing home personnel. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors learned from playing the serious game Escape COVID-19 that facilitate or impede intentions of changing infection prevention and control behavior in a large and heterogeneous Swiss population. METHODS: This fully automated, prospective web-based study, compliant with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), was conducted in all 3 main language regions of Switzerland. After creating an account on the platform, participants were asked to complete a short demographic questionnaire before accessing the serious game. The only incentive given to the potential participants was a course completion certificate, which participants obtained after completing the postgame questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who reported that they were willing to change their infection prevention and control behavior. Secondary outcomes were the infection prevention and control areas affected by this willingness and the presumed evolution in the use of specific personal protective equipment items. The elements associated with intention to change infection prevention and control behavior, or lack thereof, were also assessed. Other secondary outcomes were the subjective perceptions regarding length, difficulty, meaningfulness, and usefulness of the serious game; impression of engagement and boredom while playing the serious game; and willingness to recommend its use to friends or colleagues. RESULTS: From March 9 to June 9, 2021, a total of 3227 accounts were created on the platform, and 1104 participants (34.2%) completed the postgame questionnaire. Of the 1104 respondents, 509 respondents (46.1%) answered that they intended to change their infection prevention and control behavior after playing the game. Among the respondents who answered that they did not intend to change their behavior, 86.1% (512/595) answered that they already apply these guidelines. Participants who followed the German version were less likely to intend to change their infection prevention and control behavior (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.96; P=.04) and found the game less engaging (P<.001). Conversely, participants aged 53 years or older had stronger intentions of changing infection prevention and control behavior (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.44-2.97; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Escape COVID-19 is a useful tool to enhance correct infection prevention and control measures on a national scale, even after 2 COVID-19 pandemic waves; however, the serious game's impact was affected by language, age category, and previous educational training, and the game should be adapted to enhance its impact on specific populations.","output":"Nationwide Deployment of a Serious Game Designed to Improve COVID-19 Infection Prevention Practices in Switzerland: Prospective Web-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 Pandemic has put enormous pressure on the healthcare system globally, causing many healthcare organizations to cancel elective admission for coronary angiograms.

RESULTS: A total number of 173 STEMI patients were analyzed; 81 STEMI patients in the Pre-COVID-19 period and 92 STEMI patients in the COVID-19 period. When compared with pre-COVID period, there was a statistically non-significant increase in STEMI patients (12%), slight delay in the door to balloon timing; 94 vs 87 minutes. As well, there was more delay from onset of symptoms to presentation to the ER (>12 hours from symptoms onset to ER arrival (16% vs, 4% in group 1). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) was the main modality between the 2 groups without significant differences (100% Pre-COVID vs. 97% COVID-19 period). CONCLUSION: There was some delay of STEMI patient's presentation to the hospital during Covid-19 timing, without significant changes in the medical practice of care.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Presentation and Hospital Management of STEMI Patients in a Tertiary Care Center in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Serosurvalence is crucial in estimating the range of SARS-CoV-2 infections, predicting the possibility of another wave, and decide on a vaccination strategy. To understand the herd immunity after the COVID-19 pandemic, the seroprevalence was measured in 3062 individuals with or without COVID-19. Methods: : The levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgM and IgG were measured by the immuno-colloidal gold method. Results: : The mean seroprevalence for IgM and IgG in all participants was 2.81% and 7.51%, respectively. The positive rate of IgG was significantly higher in women than in men (P<0.05). The highest positive rate of IgM was observed in 41-60 years of age (3.49%), while the highest seroprevalence for IgG was observed in persons >60 years of age (8.61%). The positive rates of IgM and IgG in the convalescent patients were 31.82% and 77.27%, respectively, which was significantly higher than individuals with suspected syndromes or individuals without any clinical signs (P<0.01). Seroprevalence for IgG in medical staff was markedly higher than those in residents. The seroprevalence in patients with various comorbidity was no significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusions: : The low positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and NA test indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is subsiding after three months, and the possibility of reintroduction of the virus from an unidentified natural reservoir is low.

The objective of this meta-review was to synthesise the evidence on the effect of prone positioning on the incidence and location of PIs in adult intensive care unit patients. REVIEW METHOD: This is a meta-review of published systematic reviews. Five databases were searched; data were extracted by three authors and adjudicated by a fourth. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to quality appraise the selected articles, which was completed by three authors with a fourth adjudicating. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews were synthesised. The cumulative incidence of PI in 15,979 adult patients ranged from 25.7% to 48.5%. One study did not report adult numbers. Only one review reported the secondary outcome of PI location. PIs were identified in 13 locations such as the face, chest, iliac crest, and knees. Using the AMSTAR-2, three reviews were assessed as high quality, six as moderate quality, and one as low quality. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of PI in the prone position highlights the need for targeted preventative strategies. Care bundles may be one approach, given their beneficial effects for the prevention of PI in other populations. This review highlights the need for proactive approaches to limit unintended consequences of the use of the prone position, especially notable in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The effect of prone positioning on pressure injury incidence in adult intensive care unit patients: A meta-review of systematic reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard method for evaluating whether a treatment works in health care but can be difficult to find and make use of.

Outbreaks of NoVs are often associated with the consumption of NoV-contaminated oysters. Laboratory confirmation of suspected oyster samples is a critical step in the surveillance and control of NoVs. Because of non-specific amplification, false-positive results are frequently obtained by semi-nested RT-PCR with the presently widely used primer set (G2SKF/G2SKR). Here, a novel universal PCR primer set N (NG2OF/NG2OR) specific for genogroup II (GII) NoVs was designed based on all GII NoV sequences available in public databases. Specific products were obtained with the primer set N when the NoV-positive oysters, spiked with each of five representative genotypes of GII NoVs (GII.17, GII.13, GII.4, GII.3, and GII.12), were subjected to analyzing. No products were detected with the primer set N for the NoV-negative oysters, while the primer set C gave various non-specific bands. Twenty-three out of 156 fresh oyster samples were NoV-positive with both the primer set N and the classic primer set, while eight were NoV-positive solely with the primer set N. Compared with the classic primer set, the newly designed primer set N had a higher detection rate and improved specificity for GII NoVs in oyster samples. These results show that the novel PCR primer pair is specific and applicable for the detection of GII NoVs in oysters.

Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. Objective To validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods Three validation cohorts were generated: two external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and one internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes SpO2/FiO2 ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH, interleukin-6 and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by re-estimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N=1477). Results The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (AUC 0.94, 0.86 and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope 0.86, 0.94 and 0.79; intercept 0.05, 0.03 and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (AUC 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves.

In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. Results The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes. Conclusions In Colombia, primary care is presented as an opportunity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the problems and needs derived from this situation.

During the inclusion (or pandemic) visit (V(0)), patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including optical coherence tomography (OCT). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT findings from the two preceding visits (V(?1) and V(?2)) were compared with data at V(0). RESULTS: One-hundred patients (112 eyes) were enrolled in this study. The time interval between following visits was 110.7  37.5 days within V(0) and V(?1) and 80.8  39.7 days within V(?1) and V(?2), respectively (P < 0.0001). BCVA was statistically worse at the V(0) visit as compared with the immediately preceding (V(?1)) visit (0.50  0.43 LogMAR and 0.45  0.38 LogMAR at the V(0) and V(?1) visits, respectively; P = 0.046).

We aimed to investigate the association between early antibiotic therapy and the risk of in-hospital mortality in older patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective international cohort study (ANTIBIOVID) in five COVID-19 geriatric units in France and Switzerland. Among 1,357 consecutive patients aged 75 or more hospitalised and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 1072 had a radiologically confirmed pneumonia, of which 914 patients were still alive and hospitalized at 48 hours. To adjust for confounders, a propensity score for treatment was created, and stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (SIPTW) was applied. To assess the association between early antibiotic therapy and in-hospital 30-day mortality, SIPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 914 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, median age of 86, 428 (46.8%) received antibiotics in the first 48 hours after diagnosis. Among these patients, 147 (34.3%) died in hospital within one month vs 118 patients (24.3%) with no early antibiotic treatment.

RNA sequencing revealed that immune and redox mediators, including TLR4, Arg1, and HO-1, were associated with the activity MSC-EVs against ALI mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that correlative inflammatory and oxidative mediators were involved in the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs in LPS-stimulated cells and mice. Moreover, variable expression of Nrf2 was observed following treatment with MSC-EVs in cell and animal models, and knockdown of Nrf2 attenuated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of MSC-EVs in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Together, these data suggest that inhalation of MSC-EVs as a noninvasive strategy for attenuation of ALI, and the adaptive regulation of Nrf2 may contribute to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity in mice.","output":"Inhalation of MSC-EVs is a noninvasive strategy for ameliorating acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the global COVID-19 pandemic, the number of scientific papers studying the virus has grown massively, leading to increased interest in automated literate review.

Despite the causal link between S. haematobium and bladder cancer, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. S. haematobium oviposition in the bladder is associated with angiogenesis and urothelial hyperplasia. These changes may be pre-carcinogenic events in the bladder. We hypothesized that the Interleukin-4-inducing principle of Schistosoma mansoni eggs (IPSE), an S. haematobium egg-secreted infiltrin protein that enters host cell nuclei to alter cellular activity, is sufficient to induce angiogenesis and urothelial hyperplasia. Methods: Mouse bladders injected with S. haematobium eggs were analyzed via microscopy for angiogenesis and urothelial hyperplasia. Endothelial and urothelial cell lines were incubated with recombinant IPSE protein or an IPSE mutant protein that lacks the native nuclear localization sequence (NLS-) and proliferation measured using CFSE staining and real-time monitoring of cell growth. IPSEs effects on urothelial cell cycle status was assayed through propidium iodide staining. Endothelial and urothelial cell uptake of fluorophore-labeled IPSE was measured. Findings: Injection of S. haematobium eggs into the bladder triggers angiogenesis, enhances leakiness of bladder blood vessels, and drives urothelial hyperplasia. Wild type IPSE, but not NLS-, increases proliferation of endothelial and urothelial cells and skews urothelial cells towards S phase. Finally, IPSE is internalized by both endothelial and urothelial cells. Interpretation: IPSE drives endothelial and urothelial proliferation, which may depend on internalization of the molecule. The urothelial effects of IPSE depend upon its NLS. Thus, IPSE is a candidate pro-carcinogenic molecule of S. haematobium. SUMMARY: Schistosoma haematobium acts as a bladder carcinogen through unclear mechanisms. The S. haematobium homolog of IPSE, a secreted schistosome egg immunomodulatory molecule, enhances angiogenesis and urothelial proliferation, hallmarks of pre-carcinogenesis, suggesting IPSE is a key pro-oncogenic molecule of S. haematobium.","output":"IPSE, an abundant egg-secreted protein of the carcinogenic helminth Schistosoma haematobium, promotes proliferation of bladder cancer cells and angiogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 infection is an epidemic that is of major concern now more than the dengue epidemic that continues to occur today The focus of risk, especially on medical and non-medical personnel working specifically in health services, is very high because it deals directly with co-19 patients or other patients who are likely to suffer but have not been detected with other illnesses Related to this, the human resources working in the health service are affected as well as the health conditions and habits that are carried out daily that affect the level of risk that might occur COVID-19 positive patients who must be hospitalized usually have acute respiratory distress which can be fatal Identification of patients with COVID-19 infection is usually obtained after laboratory examinations which in less than half are based on congenital (comorbid) diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and those related to the heart and blood vessels","output":"Aplikasi K-Means Cluster Untuk Pengelompokan Unit Kerja Yang Beresiko COVID-19 Pada Industri Layanan Kesehatan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) may have a high risk of cardiovascular adverse events, including death from cardiovascular causes.

METHODS: Several electronic databases, including PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with relevant keywords up to 11 November 2020, were used to perform a systematic literature search. This study included research papers containing samples of adult COVID-19 patients who had data on statin use and recorded mortality as their outcome of interest. Risk estimates of mortality in statin users versus non-statin users were pooled across studies using inverse-variance weighted DerSimonian-Laird random-effect models. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a total of 52,122 patients were included in the final qualitative and quantitative analysis. Eight studies reported in-hospital use of statins; meanwhile, the remaining studies reported pre-admission use of statins. In-hospital use of statin was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.50-0.58, p < 0.00001; I2: 0%, p = 0.87), while pre-admission use of statin was not associated with mortality (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.79-1.77, p = 0.415; I2: 68.6%, p = 0.013).

METHODS Hispanic/Latino meatpacking workers with work-related musculoskeletal pain and active health concerns were recruited to participate in a study to explore health, health behaviors, and the work environment. Five focus groups (N = 28) were conducted in Nebraska between March 2019 and February 2020. Thematic analysis using the Health Belief Model constructs was used to explain workers' health behaviors including utilization of occupational health services at their workplace. FINDINGS Workers believed that there was little they could do to prevent and treat health problems. They understood the perceived threat of health problems and the benefits of self-care, but the perceived barriers often outweighed the benefits. The workplace had few prompts to motivate or incentivize self-care both in and outside of work.

Despite these challenges, self-regulated learning allows trainees to learn continuously, and one form of this is through mental practice and motor imagery. The study aimed to design and develop an online basic micro suturing training module for skill acquisition for self-regulated learning using a low-fidelity rubber glove model. METHODS: This study utilized a design and developmental research framework and Mayer's multimedia theory guidelines. The primary author created an online instructional module on micro suturing based on the ADDIE instructional design model. This module was then evaluated in a pilot study comparing the new training model to traditional methods of learning using an experimental design. RESULTS: This study describes the use of Design and Development Research to create a new model for surgical skill training and a tool for producing instructional materials and learning products for online learning. The product was evaluated using an experimental design and showed a significant effect on the quality of motor skill outcome and the richness of motor imagery using the resource developed in the research.

It only appears to us because we look at the issue through our contemporary moral philosophy of utilitarianism and an understanding of freedom as absence of constraints. Both these views can be substituted with more sophisticated alternatives, namely an ethics of virtue and a notion of freedom of the will. These offer a fuller picture of morality and enable us to cooperate with the current restrictions by consciously choosing to adhere to them instead of perceiving them as draconian and immoral.

More broadly, virtue ethics permits to deal with the practical concerns about how an individual should behave during this pandemic, given the current lockdown measures or lack thereof. In section 1, we present how utilitarianism and a notion of freedom as negative liberty support the opposition to restrictive measures.

However, data concerning the epidemiological features, viral shedding, and antibody dynamics between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and COVID-19 patients remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 193 SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in Ningbo and Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, from January 21 to March 6, 2020. All subjects were followed up to monitor the dynamics of serum antibody immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using colloidal gold-labeled and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Of those, 31 were asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, 149 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, and 14 presymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic carriers were younger and had higher levels of white blood cell and lymphocyte, lower level of C-reactive protein, and shorter viral shedding duration. Conversion of IgM from positive to negative was shorter in asymptomatic carriers than in COVID-19 patients (7.5 vs. 25.5 days, P = 0.030). The proportion of those persistently seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was higher in COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (66.1% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.037). Viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than presymptomatic patients (P = 0.003) and asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.004). Viral shedding duration was longer in presymptomatic COVID-19 patients than in asymptomatic carriers (48.0 vs. 24.0 days, P = 0.002). Asymptomatic carriers acquired infection more from intra-familial transmission than did COVID-19 patients (89.0% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.028). In 4 familial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic carriers were mainly children and young adults while severe COVID-19 was mainly found in family members older than 60 years with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic carriers might have a higher antiviral immunity to clear SARS-CoV-2 than symptomatic COVID-19 patients and this antiviral immunity should be contributable to innate and adaptive cellular immunity rather than humoral immunity. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with older age and comorbidities in familial clustering cases.","output":"Epidemiological feature, viral shedding, and antibody seroconversion among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers and symptomatic/presymptomatic COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image-based characterization and disease understanding involve integrative analysis of morphological, spatial, and topological information across biological scales.

Both types of knowledge should be gathered, codified, and disseminated efficiently and effectively. This paper investigates a recent (2014C2017) large-scale IAC R&D&I program case (Need for Speed, N4S) from a learning perspective. It was one of the programs in the Finnish SHOK (Strategic Centres of Science, Technology, and Innovation) system. The theoretical bases are in innovation management, knowledge management, and higher education (university) pedagogy. In the future, IAC projects should be more and more commonplace since major innovations are hardly ever done in isolation, not even by the largest companies. Both intra-organizational and inter-organizational learning networks are increasingly critical success factors. Collaborative learning capabilities will thus be required more often from all the participating parties. Efficient and effective knowledge creation and sharing are underpinning future core competencies. In this paper, we present and evaluate a collaboratively created and publicly shared digital knowledge repository called Treasure Chest produced during our case program. The starting point was a jointly created Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), which defined the main research themes and listed motivating research questions to begin withi.e., intended learning outcomes (ILO). During the 4-year program, our collaborative industry-academia (I-A) learning process produced a range of theoretical and empirical results, which were iteratively collected and packaged into the Treasure Chest repository. Outstandingly, it contained, in addition to traditional research documents, narratives of the industrial learning experiences and more than 100 actionable knowledge items. In conclusion, our vision of the future is that such transparently shared, ambitious, and versatile outcome goals with a continuous integrative collection of the results are keys to effective networked I-A collaboration and learning.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the frequency and quality of facemask use in general populations of different socio-spatial backgrounds. DESIGN A multi-site observational study carried out from 25 June 2020 to 21 July 2020. SETTING The observations were carried out in 43 different locations in a region in the west of France, representing various areas: rural and urban, indoor and outdoor, and in areas where masks were mandated or not. An observer was positioned at a predetermined place, facing a landmark, and collected information about the use of facemasks and socio-demographic data. PARTICIPANTS All individual passing between the observer and the landmark were included. EXPOSURE The observer collected information on whether a mask was worn, the type of mask used, the quality of the positioning, gender, and the age category of each individual. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were the use of a facemask and the quality of the positioning. Factors associated with these outcomes were identified. RESULTS A total of 3354 observations were recorded. A facemask was worn by 56.4% (n=1892) of individuals, varying from 49% (n=1359) in non-mandatory areas and 91.7% (n=533) in mandatory areas, including surgical facemasks (56.8%, n=1075) and cloth masks (43.2%, n=817). The facemask was correctly positioned in 75.2% (n=1422) of cases. The factors independently associated with wearing a facemask were being indoors (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.44), being in a mandatory area (aOR, 0.14; 95%CI, 0.10-0.20), female gender (aOR, 0.57; 95%CI, 0.49-0.66), and age >40 years (aOR, 0.54; 95%CI, 0.46-0.63). The factors independently associated with correct mask position were rural location (aOR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.97-0.98), being in an indoor area (aOR, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.38-0.65), use of a cloth mask (aOR, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.52-0.81), and age >40 years (aOR, 0.61; 95%CI 0.49-0.76).

The purpose was to capture key learnings from a rapid virtual care implementation because of the COVID-19 pandemic and to understand the impact on patient and staff experiences. METHODS Administrative data were collected for 21,362 patients who had at least one virtual or in-person visit to any provincial cancer center from April 1, 2020, to June 10, 2020. Patient surveys were conducted with 397 randomly selected patients who had received a virtual visit. Surveys were also conducted with 396 Cancer Care Alberta staff. RESULTS 14,906 virtual visits took place in this period, and about 40% of weekly visits were virtual. Significant differences were observed in both patient-reported symptom questionnaire completion rates and referrals to supportive care services between patients seen in-person and virtually. Patients receiving active treatments reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction with virtual visits than those seen for follow-up, but overall 90% of patients indicated interest in receiving virtual care in the future. Staff thought virtual visits increased patients' access to care but less than one third (31.5%) felt confident meeting patients' emotional needs and having conversations about disease progression and/or end of life virtually. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has driven the rapid implementation of virtual visits for cancer care delivery in health care settings.

Although postpartum family planning (PPFP) is an increasingly high priority for many countries, uptake and need for PPFP varies in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize postpartum contraceptive use, and predictors and barriers to use, among postpartum women in LMIC. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Global Health databases were searched for articles and abstracts published between January 1997 and May 2018. Studies with data on contraceptive uptake through 12 months postpartum in low- and middle-income countries were included. We used random-effects models to compute pooled estimates and confidence intervals of modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR), fertility intentions (birth spacing and birth limiting), and unmet need for contraception in the postpartum period. RESULTS Among 669 studies identified, 90 were selected for full-text review, and 35 met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were from East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia/South East Asia. The overall pooled mCPR during the postpartum period across all regions was 41.2% (95% CI: 15.7-69.1%), with lower pooled mCPR in West Africa (36.3%; 95% CI: 27.0-45.5%). The pooled prevalence of unmet need was 48.5% (95% CI: 19.1-78.0%) across all regions, and highest in South Asia/South East Asia (59.4, 95% CI: 53.4-65.4%). Perceptions of low pregnancy risk due to breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea were commonly associated with lack of contraceptive use and use of male condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. Women who were not using contraception were also less likely to utilize maternal and child health (MCH) services and reside in urban settings, and be more likely to have a fear of method side effects and receive inadequate FP counseling. In contrast, women who received FP counseling in antenatal and/or postnatal care were more likely to use PPFP. CONCLUSIONS PPFP use is low and unmet need for contraception following pregnancy in LMIC is high. Tailored counseling approaches may help overcome misconceptions and meet heterogeneous needs for PPFP.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of postpartum contraceptive use among women in low- and middle-income countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world was shocked by an unprecedented outbreak caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed in 8 government-designated treatment centers for COVID-19 patients in China from Dec. 2019 to Mar. 2020. Thymosin 1 was administrated with 1.6 mg qd or q12 h for more than 5 days. The primary outcomes were the 28-day and 60-day mortality, the secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and the total duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification. RESULTS: Of the 334 enrolled COVID-19 patients, 42 (12.6%) died within 28 days, and 55 (16.5%) died within 60 days of hospitalization. There was a significant difference in the 28-day mortality between the thymosin 1 and non-thymosin 1-treated groups in adjusted model (P=0.016), without obvious differences in the 60-day mortality and survival time in the overall cohort (P>0.05). In the subgroup analysis, it was found that thymosin 1 therapy significantly reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.63, P=0.013) via improvement of Pa0(2)/FiO(2) (P=0.036) and prolonged the hospital length of stay (P=0.024) as well as the total duration of the disease (P=0.001) in the critical type patients, especially those aged over 64 years, with white blood cell >6.810(9)/L, neutrophil >5.310(9)/L, lymphocyte <0.7310(9)/L, PaO(2)/FiO(2)<196, SOFA >3, and APACHE II >7. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that treatment with thymosin 1 can markedly decrease 28-day mortality and attenuate acute lung injury in critical type COVID-19 patients.","output":"Thymosin 1 Therapy in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: a Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the interactions and transmission of pathogens with/via inanimate surfaces common in the built environment and public transport vehicles is critical to promoting sustainable and resilient urban development. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) to some of these surfaces at different temperatures (same for surfaces and ambiance) ranging from -23 to 60 C. Surfaces simulated are aluminum, copper, copper oxide, polyethylene (PE), and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Steered MD (SMD) simulations are also used to investigate the transfer of the virus from PE and SiO2 when a contaminated surface is touched. The virus shows the lowest and highest adhesions to PE and SiO2, respectively (20 vs 534 eV). Influence of temperature is not found to be noticeable. Using simulated water molecules to represent moisture on the skin, SMD simulations show that water molecules can lift the virus from the PE surface but damage the virus when lifting it from the the SiO2 surface. The results suggest that the PE surface is a more favorable surface to transmit the virus than the other surfaces simulated in this study.

The optimal method for histological assessment of response and the effect of NAET on the tumour morphology, grade and molecular profile remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS A single large institution cohort of 132 patients who received NAET over a 13-year period was identified. Comprehensive clinical, histopathological and follow up data were collected. A detailed histological review of a subset with residual post-treatment carcinoma was undertaken. RESULTS Two carcinomas (both of lobular type) achieved complete pathological response. Central scarring was seen in 49.3% of tumours post-treatment. Significant changes in tumour type (41.6%), grade (downgrading in a third of tumours), PR expression (22.3%) with a switch to PR negative status in 17.6% of cases were observed. The latter was associated with absence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p=0.005). 10% of cases showed a change in HER2 expression (p=0.002). Median patient survival was 60 months and downgrading of tumours was associated with better overall survival (p=0.05).

MAIN METHODS: HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing control vector, ORF8, ORF10, or M protein were assayed for cell number and markers of apoptosis at 24 h, and interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression at 14 h, with or without CBD. Cells transfected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) were also studied as a general model of RNA-type viral infection. KEY FINDINGS: Reduced cell number and increased early and late apoptosis were found when expression of viral genes was combined with 1C2 M CBD treatment, but not in control-transfected cells treated with CBD, or in cells expressing viral genes but treated only with vehicle. In cells expressing viral genes, CBD augmented expression of IFN, IFN1 and IFN2/3, as well as the 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family members OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL. CBD also augmented expression of these genes in control cells not expressing viral genes, but without enhancing apoptosis. CBD similarly enhanced the cellular anti-viral response to Poly (I:C). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate a poor ability of HEK293 cells to respond to SARS-CoV-2 genes alone, but an augmented innate anti-viral response to these genes in the presence of CBD. Thus, CBD may prime components of the innate immune system, increasing readiness to respond to RNA-type viral infection without activating apoptosis, and could be studied for potential in prophylaxis.","output":"Effect of cannabidiol on apoptosis and cellular interferon and interferon-stimulated gene responses to the SARS-CoV-2 genes ORF8, ORF10 and M protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This editorial proposes directions for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to meet its current and future obligations as a source of public information and communication on food\\\\related risks in the EU.

Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-, and induced protein 10.

DBS teleprogramming technology was developed and deployed in China before the COVID-19 outbreak. In this report, the authors share their experiences with telemedical DBS treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Four patients (2 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1 with major depressive disorder, and 1 with anorexia nervosa) underwent DBS surgery at Ruijin Hospital and received continuous postoperative DBS telemedicine case management from January 2020 to July 2020. DBS teleprogramming, individualized psychological support, and medical consultations were provided via the authors' DBS telemedicine platform, which also incorporated a synchronous real-time video communication system. RESULTS: Forty-five DBS telemedicine sessions were conducted; there was no unexpected loss of network connection during the sessions. Of these, 28 sessions involved DBS teleprogramming. Adjustments were made to the stimulation voltage, frequency, pulse width, and contact site in 21, 12, 9, and 9 sessions, respectively. Psychological support and troubleshooting were provided during the remaining telemedicine sessions. Modest to substantial clinical improvements after DBS surgery were observed in some but not all patients, whereas stimulation-related side effects were reported by 2 patients and included reversible sleep and mood problems, headache, and a sensation of heat. CONCLUSIONS: DBS telemedicine seems to offer a feasible, safe, and efficient strategy for maintaining the delivery of medical care to psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors propose that implementation of a comprehensive DBS telemedicine system, which combines DBS teleprogramming with psychological counseling, medical consultations, and medication prescriptions and delivery, could be an efficient and effective approach to manage the mental health and quality of life of patients with psychiatric disorders during future local or global public health crises.","output":"Deep brain stimulation telemedicine programming during the COVID-19 pandemic: treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: to assess the clinical and retinal imaging features of patients in whom retinal vascular occlusion had developed in temporal associations with Covid-19 vaccination.

RESULTS: A total of 330 Chinese urologists participated in our survey, and the response rate was 89.7% (330/368). Among the participants, 40.9% (135/330) were associate chief physicians. The proportion of participants who took part in conventional face-to-face academic conferences decreased from 92.7% (306/330) before the COVID-19 pandemic to 22.1% (73/330) during the pandemic (P<.001). In contrast, the proportion of urologists who took part in virtual conferences increased from 69.4% (229/330) to 90% (297/330) (P<.001). Most urologists (70.7%, 210/297) chose to participate in the virtual conferences at home and thought that a meeting length of 1-2 hours was most appropriate. Among the urologists, 73.7% (219/297) reported that their participation in the virtual conferences went smoothly, while the remaining respondents reported that they had experienced lags in video and audio streaming during the virtual conferences. When comparing conventional face-to-face conferences with virtual conferences, 70.7% (210/297) of the respondents thought that both conference formats were acceptable, while 17.9% (53/297) preferred virtual conferences and 11.5% (34/297) preferred conventional face-to-face meetings.

Our computational analyses identify a shared five-amino acid long sequence motif (TQLPP) with similar structure and antibody-binding properties for these proteins, strongly indicative of molecular mimicry with potential for cross-reactivity. Our results are supported by reports of the presence of antibodies against epitopes containing TQLPP in both COVID-19 and pre-pandemic patient samples, indicating antibody cross-reactivity between Spike and a human protein. Since the Spike protein is the antigenic component of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, altering the motif may reduce the risk for thrombocytopenia and improve long-term protection against evolving variants. Our findings highlight the importance of considering peptide-level molecular mimicry when developing therapeutic interventions and designing vaccines to avoid potential autoimmune reactions.","output":"Molecular mimicry between Spike and human thrombopoietin may induce thrombocytopenia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High volume extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) centers have developed mobile ECMO programs in recent years to facilitate the implementation of ECMO support at hospitals with lower capabilities, and transfer these patients for further care.

Few prospective studies report the incidence and risk of sarcopenia. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the prevalence of sarcopenia at the baseline and follow-up after 2 years in community-dwelling older Thai individuals. METHODS: In 2019, 330 older people were recruited from a community-dwelling population, and these participants were requested to present again in 2021. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the criteria for the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS). All participants were asked to perform a 6-meter walk test, handgrip strength test, and bioelectric impedance assessment, and complete the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: The study found that the prevalence of sarcopenia was 65 (19.70%) in 330 older people in 2019, and 44 of 205 participants (21.46%) were reported to have sarcopenia after 2 years. The incidence of sarcopenia was noted to be 2.44% in 2021. Analysis with ANOVA and pairwise comparisons showed that the reversibility of sarcopenia was attributed to high level of physical activity in the 2-year follow-up group (p = 0.014, 95% CI [?1753.25C?195.49]). Further, participants with moderate and high physical activity had a reduced incidence of sarcopenia (odds ratio = 9.00 and 14.47, respectively). Therefore, low physical activity in older people led to the development of sarcopenia from the baseline to the 2-year follow-up, indicating that increased physical activity may be useful in reversing sarcopenia, as suggested in the 2-year follow-up study. Low physical activity could be a risk factor for the incidence of sarcopenia. Hence, the prevention of sarcopenia could promote health improvement through moderate to high physical activity.","output":"Prevalence and incidence of sarcopenia and low physical activity among community-dwelling older Thai people: a preliminary prospective cohort study 2-year follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A close interaction between the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system of an individual results in a diverse clinical manifestation of the COVID-19 disease. While adaptive immune responses are essential for SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance, the innate immune cells, such as macrophages, may contribute, in some cases, to the disease progression. Macrophages have shown a significant production of IL-6 suggesting they may contribute to the excessive inflammation in COVID-19 disease. Macrophage Activation Syndrome may further explain the high serum levels of CRP, which are normally lacking in viral infections. In adaptive immune responses, it has been revealed that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells exhibit functional exhaustion patterns, such as the expression of NKG2A, PD-1, and TIM-3. Since SARS-CoV-2 restrains antigen presentation by downregulating MHC class I and II molecules and, therefore, inhibits the T cell-mediated immune responses, humoral immune responses also play a substantial role. Specific IgA response appears to be stronger and more persistent than IgM response. Moreover, IgM and IgG antibodies show similar dynamics in COVID-19 disease.","output":"COVID-19 and the immune system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of service failure in rendering service process during COVID-19.

Service failure has increased due to unexpected circumstances produced by this pandemic. It has become necessary for the webstores to retain their dissatisfied customers by reconsidering their service strategies. Relevant data for the purpose of this study were collected through questionnaires from 383 respondents by using online channels. The online channels were exclusively employed for maintaining the safety of respondents during COVID-19. Respondents for this study were online shoppers who encountered service failure during COVID-19. The results indicated that the incidence of service failure has increased due to an increase in online shopping during COVID-19. Some customers tend to repurchase from the same webstore. On the other hand, some customers do not want to purchase again from the same seller and decided to switch to the alternative webstore. Based on the findings, new strategy for online shopping service providers was introduced. This strategy will be helpful for the online service providers to increase their profitability by retaining their dissatisfied customers. Service providers can minimize the number of customers switching to other webstores by reducing the events of service failure. Customers assistive intent can also be helpful for service providers to increase the efficiency of service recovery. Conducting a proper follow-up after providing service recovery can also reduce the switching of customer.

Unfortunately, towards the end of 2020, the number of daily new cases exponentially increased.

To understand whether these B.1.1.28+Q675H+Q677H sequences were part of an emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineage broadly disseminated in Uruguay, herein we analyzed the country-wide genetic diversity of viruses between November, 2020 and April, 2021.

This clade spread to other Uruguayan departments, with evidence of further local transmission clusters. It also spread to the USA and Spain. The Q675H and Q677H mutations are in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary and also arose independently in many SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide. Although in Uruguay the B.1.1.28+Q675H+Q677H lineage was dominated by the VOC P.1 since April 2021, the monitoring of the concurrent emergence of Q675H+Q677H in VOIs and/or VOCs should be of worldwide interest.","output":"Emergence and spread of a B.1.1.28-derived lineage with Q675H and Q677H Spike mutations in Uruguay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Translation of knowledge into policy and practice is important to prevent sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR)-related morbidity and mortality and ensure access to rights. Existing approaches to knowledge translation are often relatively rigid and implicitly assume linear processes, leading to time-consuming processes that are not tailored to countries' needs. APPROACH: SRHR knowledge platforms designed and implemented a collaborative rapid improvement model for knowledge translation (CRIM-KT) in Burundi, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Jordan. The approach consisted of learning sessions and action periods aimed at improving policies and practices addressing the prevention of child marriage and teenage pregnancies. To evaluate the approach, a participatory action learning process took place throughout the implementation (September 2017 and January 2019). An end evaluation was conducted using a desk review of project documentation, in-depth interviews, and a focus group discussion to document the process, outcomes, and lessons learned. ACHIEVEMENTS: In Indonesia, a local government policy was changed that aims to prevent child marriage by avoiding misinterpretation of a local cultural practice. In Jordan, the cabinet endorsed a national action plan to prevent child marriage and changes in practice took place. In Burundi, no tangible changes in policy and practice in SRHR were observed. In Bangladesh, practice changed by strengthening coordination for collaboration and exchange among stakeholders to prevent child marriage. In all countries, the approach considerably strengthened participants' knowledge translation capacities. CONCLUSION: The CRIM-KT led to improvements in policy and practice in a relatively short time frame and different contexts. This can be explained by the systematic, structured, and participatory approach, allowing for contextual adaptation and involvement of stakeholders, as well as the cross-learning on 2 levels (international and country collaboration teams). The principles of the CRIM-KT may be further developed and applied in other fields in global health to strengthen knowledge translation processes.","output":"Using a Rapid Knowledge Translation Approach for Better Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Bangladesh, Burundi, Indonesia, and Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluation of the performance of a new set of primers defined from the ORF1ab sequence, and its combination with a previously published set of primers from the N sequence, to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique is presented.

This study compared breast and axillary response and survival after NCT and NET in HR+ breast cancer. METHODS: Based on American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1031 criteria, women age 50 years or older with cT2-4 HR+ breast cancer who underwent NET or NCT and surgery were identified in the National Cancer Database 2010C2016. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis determined differences between the NCT and NET groups and therapy response, including downstaging and pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0/is and ypN0). RESULTS: Of 19,829 patients, 14,025 (70.7%) received NCT and 5804 (29.3%) received NET. The NET patients were older (mean age, 68.9 vs. 60.3; P < 0.001) and had greater comorbidity (1+ CharlsonCDeyo score, 21% vs. 16%; P < 0.001). Therapy achieved T downstaging (any) for 58% of the patients with NCT versus 40.5% of the patients with NET, and in-breast pCR was achieved for 9.3% of the NCT versus 1.3% of the NET patients (P < 0.001). Approximately half of the mastectomy procedures could have been potentially avoided for the patients with in-breast pCR (53.6% of the NCT and 43.8% of the NET patients). For the cN+ patients, N downstaging (any) was 29% for the NCT patients versus 18.3% for the NET patients (P < 0.001), and nodal pCR was achieved for 20.3% of the NCT versus 13.5% of the NET patients (P < 0.001). Among those with nodal pCR, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) still was performed for 56% of the patients after NCT and 45% of the patients after NET. CONCLUSIONS: Although the response rates after NCT were higher, NET achieved both T and N downstaging and pCR.

HREM has proven to be specifically advantageous when integrated in correlative multimodal imaging (CMI) pipelines. CMI creates a composite and zoomable view of exactly the same specimen and region of interest by (sequentially) correlating two or more modalities. CMI combines complementary modalities to gain holistic structural, functional, and chemical information of the entire sample and place molecular details into their overall spatiotemporal multiscale context. HREM has an advantage over in vivo 3D imaging techniques on account of better histomorphologic resolution while simultaneously providing volume data. HREM also has certain advantages over ex vivo light microscopy modalities. The latter can provide better cellular resolution but usually covers a limited area or volume of tissue, with limited 3D structural context. HREM has predominantly filled a niche in the phenotyping of embryos and characterisation of anatomic developmental abnormalities in various species.

We describe, in this article, two new techniques that utilize existing instrumentations: an access and a retraction technique. METHODS A consecutive series of 23 selected patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis underwent SILS cholecystectomy from April 10, 2009 to August 12, 2009. The overall procedure was similar to SILS cholecystectomy described in the literature.

The prevalence of high blood pressure is steadily rising as the population grows amongst older adults with the ageing population. Therapeutical treatments are widely available to decrease blood pressures, in addition to many lifestyle options, such as dietary changes and exercise. There is a marked preference amongst patients, as reiterated by Hypertension Canada, for more research into non-therapeutic methods for controlling blood pressure or to reduce the burden of taking many pills to control high blood pressure. Indeed, effective options do exist, especially with diet, specifically decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake. Current public health outreach primarily focusses on sodium intake, even though potassium intake remains low in the Western world. Excellent data exist in published research that increasing potassium intake, either via dietary modification or supplements, reduces blood pressure and reduces risk of cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke. However, the advice most often provided by medical professionals is to eat more fruits and vegetables which has little impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: We propose to do a clinical trial in two stages with an adaptive trial design. In the first stage, participants with high blood pressure and proven low potassium intake (measured on the basis of a 24-h urine collection) will get individually tailored dietary advice, reinforced by weekly supportive phone/email support. At 4 weeks, if there has not been a measured increase in potassium intake, participants will be prescribed an additional potassium supplement. Testing will be conducted again at 8 weeks, to confirm the efficacy of the potassium supplement. Final measurements will be planned at 52 weeks to observe and measure the persistence of the effect of diet or additional supplement. Concurrent measurements of sodium intake, blood pressure, participant satisfaction, and safety measures will also be done. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will help determine the most effective method of increasing potassium intake, thus reducing blood pressure and need for blood pressure-lowering medicines, and at the same time potentially increasing participant satisfaction. The current guidelines recommend changes in diet, not a potassium supplement, to increase potassium intake; hence, the two-stage design will only add supplements if the most rigorous dietary advice does not work.

The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics of the patients treated for COVID-19 at Guadarrama Hospital and to identify the associated mortality factors in those admitted in an acute situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted from 3/15 to 5/15/2020. Sociodemographic, mental, functional, analytical, clinical, radiological and therapeutic variables were collected. Factors associated with mortality were analysed using a bivariate and multivariate study. RESULTS: Two hundred eleven patients were included: 102 (48.3%) in an acute situation and 109 (51.7%) in the convalescent phase, the median (interquartile range) age was 82 (72, 85) years. The most frequent symptoms were fever, cough and respiratory failure. The 89.9% had pneumonia. An acute mortality rate of 26.5% (27/102) was detected and the associated factors were: respiratory failure (P 0.002), Charlson index (ChI)&#8805;3 (P<0.001), CURB&#8805;2 (P 0.011), low SatO2/FiO2 ratio (<0.001), elevated urea (P<0.001) and creatinine (P 0.036), hypoproteinemia (P 0.037) and age (P<0.018).

Smartphone-enabled otoscopy may improve examination quality and serve as a potential diagnostic tool for middle ear diseases using a telemedicine approach. The main objectives are to compare the correctness of smartphone-enabled otoscopy and traditional otoscopy and to evaluate the diagnostic confidence of the examiner via meta-analysis. From inception through 20 January 2022, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched. Studies comparing smartphone-enabled otoscopy with traditional otoscopy regarding the outcome of interest were eligible. The relative risk (RR) for the rate of correctness in diagnosing ear conditions and the standardized mean difference (SMD) in diagnostic confidence were extracted. Sensitivity analysis and trial sequential analyses (TSAs) were conducted to further examine the pooled results. Study quality was evaluated by using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool 2. Consequently, a total of 1840 examinees were divided into the smartphone-enabled otoscopy group and the traditional otoscopy group. Overall, the pooled result showed that smartphone-enabled otoscopy was associated with higher correctness than traditional otoscopy (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.51; p = 0.01; I(2) = 70.0%). Consistently significant associations were also observed in the analysis after excluding the simulation study (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.21; p = 0.04; I(2) = 0%) and normal ear conditions (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.40; p = 0.04; I(2) = 65.0%).

In its place, psychotherapy via video conference was used as an alternative option for treatment. OBJECTIVE: The present study was concerned with the question of the actual use of this form of psychotherapy during the lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Therapists in the psychotherapeutic training outpatient department of the Medical School of Hanover were questioned on their experiences and the experiences of patients with the use of the video consultation during running guideline psychotherapy. Data from 338 patents could be collated. The data contained information, for example on acceptance or rejection of the offer of a video consultation, on the reasons for rejection and on technical problems by the execution. RESULTS: The presented data show that 35% of patients could not be reached by the video consultation. Approximately half of the patients from this group could not use this form of therapy due to the lack of technical equipment. The other half did not want therapy using the video consultation, although the technical requirements were available. In the group of patients who used the video consultation, the session was interrupted due to technical disturbances in 31% of the cases. In a further 10% of the cases the disturbances even led to a premature termination of the session. The presented data make it clear that the use of therapy via video consultation significantly decreases with increasing age and reduced education level. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that a considerable proportion of the patients could not be reached by the offer, despite the dissemination of the video consultation; therefore, in the case of further lockdowns special offers for this group should be considered.

The Act is designed to raise awareness of, prevent, control, and eradicate infectious or communicable diseases to address public health emergencies and reduce health risks. A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Bangladesh on 8 March 2020, and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a gazette on 23 March, listing COVID-19 as an infectious disease and addressing COVID-19 as a public health emergency. The gazette empowers the government to monitor the spread of infection. Despite there being an infrastructure of research ethics committees in almost all hospitals in Bangladesh, a lack of such committees in the clinical setting often forces healthcare professionals to allocate scarce healthcare resources to the task. These personnel are often either influenced by materialistic matters or guided by the emergency policies, without reaching a consensus on how to allocate scarce resources in times of need, especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ethical dilemmas often arise when a number of patients with COVID-19, especially in poor and middle-class areas, are denied care while elites are prioritized to receive such scarce resources. Resource allocation in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh appears to be unethical and in direct conflict with the biomedical principles of non-maleficence and procedural justice.

Sociodemographic and clinical data, fear of COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that 21.44% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and 19.4% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed, receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn's disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), and media use as a source of knowledge about COVID-19. Immunocompromised and chronic disease patients are vulnerable to fear and anxiety during epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

RESULT: Three key factors to healthcare providers burnout were identified in the sampled hospitals: job stress, staff and resource adequacy, fear of COVID-19 infection, and interprofessional relationships in healthcare practice. The examination also offers recommendations for lowering and preventing healthcare providers' burnout in Jordanian hospitals. CONCLUSION: This study explored the main factors of healthcare providers burnout during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Jordanian hospitals, thereby making an original contribution to existing knowledge, as it is the first empirical exploration of healthcare providers' burnout during the outbreak of COVID-19. As such, it has attempted to offer an in-depth understanding of the factors impacting this issue.","output":"Understanding the factors influencing healthcare providers burnout during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Jordanian hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to create awareness on pandemic disease among rural populations Pandemic is pathogens that are transmitted via direct contact between the susceptible and the infective populations Respiratory infection disease such as influenza are a major public health issue best dealt with by preventive messages generally emphasise improved hand hygiene, face mask use by infected persons, and social distancing measures, including avoiding crowds during pandemic In this survey 81 2% of the rural population were aware about pandemic diseases, 17 8% of the population not aware about pandemic diseases 78 2% of the population knew that coronavirus is pandemic diseases 20 8% of the population did not know that coronavirus is a pandemic disease 83 2% of the population were aware about coronavirus 15 8% of the population were not aware about coronavirus The present survey shows there is a less awareness of pandemic disease among the rural population Therefore, awareness should be developed to spread knowledge in the rural population and especially to those who are more susceptible to become infected","output":"Awareness of pandemic disease among rural population - A survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces new-onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection or glucotoxic condition increased the cellular secretion of GP73. Secreted GP73 trafficked to the liver and kidney to stimulate gluconeogenesis through cAMP/PKA pathway. By using global phosphoproteomics, we found a drastic remodeling of PKA kinase hub exerted by GP73. Notably, COVID-19 patients showed pathologically elevated plasma GP73, and neutralization of the secreted GP73 inhibited enhanced PKA signaling and glucose production associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. GP73 blockade also reduced gluconeogenesis and lowered hyperglycemia in type 2 (T2D) diabetic mice.

While mitochondrial, cytosolic and multi-organelle pathways are known to be involved in the neuromuscular LS pathogenesis, compartment-specific metabolomics has, to date, not been applied to murine models of CID. We thus hypothesized that sub-cellular metabolomics would be able to contribute organelle-specific insights to known Ndufs4 metabolic perturbations. To that end, whole brains and skeletal muscle from late-stage Ndufs4 mice and age/sex-matched controls were harvested for mitochondrial and cytosolic isolation. Untargeted (1)H-NMR and semi-targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics was applied to the resulting cell fractions, whereafter important variables (VIPs) were selected by univariate statistics. A predominant increase in multiple targeted amino acids was observed in whole-brain samples, with a more prominent effect at the mitochondrial level. Similar pathways were implicated in the muscle tissue, showing a greater depletion of core metabolites with a compartment-specific distribution, however. The altered metabolites expectedly implicate altered redox homeostasis, alternate RC fueling, one-carbon metabolism, urea cycling and dysregulated proteostasis to different degrees in the analyzed tissues. A first application of EDTA-chelated magnesium and calcium measurement by NMR also revealed tissue- and compartment-specific alterations, implicating stress response-related calcium redistribution between neural cell compartments, as well as whole-cell muscle magnesium depletion. Altogether, these results confirm the ability of compartment-specific metabolomics to capture known alterations related to Ndufs4 KO and CID while proving its worth in elucidating metabolic compartmentalization in said pathways that went undetected in the diluted whole-cell samples previously studied.","output":"Sub-Cellular Metabolomics Contributes Mitochondria-Specific Metabolic Insights to a Mouse Model of Leigh Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is proposed using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations by incorporating self protection behavior changes in the population The disease free equilibrium point is computed, and both the local and global stability analysis was performed The basic reproduction number (R0) of the model is computed using the method of next generation matrix The disease free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically and globally stable under certain conditions Based on the available data, the unknown model parameters are estimated using a combination of least square and Bayesian estimation methods for different countries The forward sensitivity index is applied to determine and identify the key model parameters for the spread of disease dynamics The sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus vary from country to country We found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment It illustrates that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus Numerical simulations of the model were performed to supplement and verify the effectiveness of the analytical findings","output":"Modeling the effect of contaminated objects for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic with self protection behavior changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Although cardiac involvement has prognostic significance in COVID-19 and is associated with severe presentations, few studies have explored the prognostic role of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed-up for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Results Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE.

One proposal is use of a single ventilator to support 4 patients. METHODS A ventilator was modified to allow attachment of 4 circuits. Each circuit was connected to one chamber of 2 dual-chambered, test lungs. The ventilator was set at a tidal volume (V(T)) of 2.0 L, respiratory frequency of 10 breaths/min, and PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O. Tests were repeated with pressure targeted breaths at 15 cm H(2)O. Airway pressure, volume, and flow were measured at each chamber. The test lungs were set to simulate 4 patients using combinations of resistance (R) and compliance (C). These included equivalent C and R, constant R and variable C, constant C and variable R, and variable C and variable R. RESULTS When R and C were equivalent the V(T) distributed to each chamber of the test lung was similar during both volume (range 428-442 mL) and pressure (range 528-544 mL) breaths. Changing C while R was constant resulted in large variations in delivered V(T) (volume range 257-621 mL, pressure range 320-762 mL). Changing R while C was constant resulted in a smaller variation in V(T) (volume range 418-460 mL, pressure range 502-554 mL) compared to only C changes. When R and C were both varied, the range of delivered V(T) in both volume (336-517 mL) and pressure (417-676 mL) breaths was greater, compared to only R changes. CONCLUSIONS Using a single ventilator to support 4 patients is an attractive concept; however, the V(T) cannot be controlled for each subject and V(T) disparity is proportional to the variability in compliance. Along with other practical limitations, these findings cannot support the use of this concept for mass-casualty respiratory failure.","output":"Use of a single ventilator to support 4 patients: laboratory evaluation of a limited concept."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La Repblica del Ecuador (en adelante Ecuador) puede ser considerada como uno de los pases latinoamericanos ms privilegiados por sus contrastes geogrficos, variedad climtica y amplia biodiversidad.

Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs. We have further hypothesized that the immunogenicity of highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) may be reduced or eliminated by their very weak or absent interactions with germline antibodies and immune responses leading to the elicitation of bnAbs may not be initiated and/or sustained. Even if such responses are initiated, the maturation pathways are so extraordinarily complex that prolonged periods of time may be required for elicitation of bnAbs with defined unique sequences.

The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 C or at 37 C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0106- 5.5107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.","output":"Impaired performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests at elevated and low temperatures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relatives of those affected by COVID-19 were thrown into a brutal deterioration in the state of health of one of their own, and they went through a terrible time right from the acute phase of the epidemic.

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of human COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1 to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND (animal models), (hamsters), (nonhuman primates), (macaques), (rodent), (mice), (rats), (ferrets), (rabbits), (cats), and (dogs). Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. RESULT: Thirteen peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met the inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n = 13), mice (n = 7), ferrets (n = 4), hamsters (n = 4), and cats (n = 1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology, and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in nonhuman primates, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled a cytokine storm or coagulopathy.

Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.","output":"Bayesian Reconstruction of Disease Outbreaks by Combining Epidemiologic and Genomic Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine and integrate last two decades of research on euthanasia from a cultural perspective.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Literature Review. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were queried using combined key words such as telemedicine, covid and otolaryngology. The searches were completed in MarchCAugust 2020. Additional queries were made with particular subspecialty phrases such as rhinology or otology to maximize yield of relevant titles. Relevant articles were selected for abstract review. Applicable abstracts were then selected for review of the full text. RESULTS: Initial search identified 279 results. These were screened for relevance and 100 abstracts were selected for review. Abstracts were excluded if they were not in English, not related to otolaryngology, or if the full text was unavailable for access. Of these, 37 articles were selected for complete review of the full text. CONCLUSION: The sudden healthcare closures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp increase in the use of telemedicine, particularly in subspecialty fields. Otolaryngologists are at a unique risk of infection resulting from the examination of the head and neck and aerosol-generating procedures due to the predilection of viral particles for the nasal cavities and pharynx. The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a catalyst to implement telemedicine into clinical practice, however identifying ways to integrate telemedicine long term is key for a sustainable and viable practice in the post-COVID-19 era. Although many states are now finding themselves on the down-sloping side of their infection rate curve, many others remain at the apex. Additionally, the risk of future waves of this pandemic, or the onset of another pandemic, should not be overlooked. Practice modification guidelines that mitigate infection risk by utilizing telemedicine would be useful in these instances. Telemedicine can help to reduce infection spread by limiting unnecessary in-person interactions and help conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) by facilitating remote care with the added benefits of expanding care to broad geographic areas, limiting cost, time, and travel burden on patients and families, and enabling consistent follow up.","output":"Continuation of telemedicine in otolaryngology post-COVID-19: Applications by subspecialty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] study is a continuing phase 3 trial investigating the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab, an 47 integrin antagonist for ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions containing icodextrin as the osmotic agent have advantages during long dwells. The glucose polymers that constitute icodextrin are a heterogeneous mix of molecules with a polydispersity [ratio of weight-average to number-average molecular weight (Mw/Mn)] of approximately 2.6. The present study evaluates whether modifications in the polydispersity and concentration of glucose polymers can improve ultrafiltration (UF) without an associated increase in carbohydrate absorption (CA). ? METHODS Computer simulations using a three-pore model of peritoneal transport during a long dwell in PD patients predict that, in general, compared with 7.5% icodextrin, glucose polymers with a Mw greater than or equal to 7.5 kDa, a polydispersity less than 2.6, and concentrations greater than 7% could achieve higher UF without higher CA. Based on the simulations, we hypothesized that, compared with 7.5% icodextrin, glucose polymers with a Mw of 18 - 19 kDa and a polydispersity of 2.0 at 11% concentration could achieve higher UF without a higher CA. We tested this hypothesis in experimental studies using 8-hour dwells in New Zealand White rabbits. In those studies, UF was measured by complete fluid collection, and CA was measured by subtracting the total carbohydrate in the collected fluid from the carbohydrate initially infused. ? RESULTS The UF was higher with 11% 19 kDa glucose polymer than with 7.5% icodextrin (mean  standard deviation: 89  31 mL vs 49  15 mL; p = 0.004) without higher CA (5.2  0.9 g vs 5.0  0.9 g, p = 0.7).

This study aimed to explore the association between the lockdown policy and maternal depressive symptoms, and whether such association was mediated by internet use and/or family support. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used multi-stage sampling techniques in central and western China. Data were collected from 1266 pregnant women using a structtured questionnaire that measured internet use, family support, and depressive symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Internet use was measured by length of usage and varierity of purpose for internet use. Family support was measureed by spousal support and parental support. The structural equation modelling was employed to conduct mediation analysis to test the specificity of the hypothetical paths. RESULTS: Overall, 527 respondents (41.63%) presented depressive symptoms. The lockdown policy was negatively associated with depressive symptoms in pregnant women ( = ? 0.925, 95% CI = ?1.510, ? 0.360).

Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24a??hours after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation (MBB) followed by high performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin (PCT) and C- reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on day 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44a??M could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity and negative predictive value 95.9%.

Very little is known about the infection mechanism for this virus. More importantly, there are no drugs or vaccines that can cure or prevent a person from getting COVID-19. In this study, the binding affinity of 2692 protease inhibitor compounds that are known in the protein data bank, are calculated against the main protease of the novel coronavirus with docking and molecular dynamics (MD). Both the docking and MD methods predict the macrocyclic tissue factor-factor VIIa (PubChem ID: 118098670) inhibitor to bind strongly with the main protease with a binding affinity of -10.6 and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The TF-FVIIa inhibitors are known to prevent the coagulation of blood and have antiviral activity as shown in the case of SARS coronavirus. Two more inhibitors, phenyltriazolinones (PubChem ID: 104161460) and allosteric HCV NS5B polymerase thumb pocket 2 (PubChem ID: 163632044) have shown antiviral activity and also have high affinity towards the main protease of COVID-19. Furthermore, these inhibitors interact with the catalytic dyad in the active site of the COVID-19 main protease that is especially important in viral replication.

However, when consumers are facing personal risks (being ill) and environmental risks (pandemic), the effect of privacy concerns on continued use intention of telemedicine is unknown. The large user pool of virtual visits during COVID-19 provides a great opportunity to understand consumers' privacy concerns when facing personal and environmental risks. Objective: This research investigates how patients weigh personal risks (e.g., illness) and environmental risks (e.g., pandemic) against privacy concerns when deciding whether to utilize telemedicine as an option for being treated for an acute illness. Methods: Respondents (1,059 qualified) meeting the following criteria: 18 years old, U.S. residents, virtual patient for acute conditions during COVID-19, and a Human Intelligence Task approval rate of >95%, were recruited utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk during the middle of the pandemic. An online survey was conducted to collect data. Results: Analysis indicates that first-time telepatients (82% of respondents) have greater privacy concerns than repeat users. Findings also indicate that patients who are female and have some college education or less reported greater privacy concerns. Interestingly, privacy concerns are positively related to continued use intention. This result holds when satisfaction and user characteristics are controlled. Conclusions: When consumers are ill, privacy concerns still play an important role in telemedicine adoption. However, under environmental risks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, privacy concerns do not negatively impact their continued use intention, and satisfaction is positively associated with continued use intention.","output":"Privacy Concerns and Continued Use Intention of Telemedicine During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prolongs QTc corrected interval (QTc).

Secondary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital all-cause mortality. Methods: Patients under treatment with double (DT) and triple therapy (TT) for COVID-19 were consecutively included in this prospective observational study. Serial in-hospital electrocardiograms were performed to measure QTc at baseline and during therapy. Results: 168 patients (66.2 years old) were included: 32.1% received DT and 67.9% received TT. The mean baseline QTc was 410.33 ms. Patients under DT and TT prolonged QTc interval respect baseline values (p < 0.001), without significant differences between both therapy groups (p = 0.748).

Substantial efforts have been made to decipher the relationship between CNVs and pathogenesis but with limited success. RESULTS We have developed a novel computational framework X-CNV ( www.unimd.org/XCNV ), to predict the pathogenicity of CNVs by integrating more than 30 informative features such as allele frequency (AF), CNV length, CNV type, and some deleterious scores. Notably, over 14 million CNVs across various ethnic groups, covering nearly 93% of the human genome, were unified to calculate the AF. X-CNV, which yielded area under curve (AUC) values of 0.96 and 0.94 in training and validation sets, was demonstrated to outperform other available tools in terms of CNV pathogenicity prediction. A meta-voting prediction (MVP) score was developed to quantitively measure the pathogenic effect, which is based on the probabilistic value generated from the XGBoost algorithm. The proposed MVP score demonstrated a high discriminative power in determining pathogenetic CNVs for inherited traits/diseases in different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS The ability of the X-CNV framework to quantitatively prioritize functional, deleterious, and disease-causing CNV on a genome-wide basis outperformed current CNV-annotation tools and will have broad utility in population genetics, disease-association studies, and diagnostic screening.","output":"X-CNV: genome-wide prediction of the pathogenicity of copy number variations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS: SARS-CoV-2 is affecting different countries all over the world, with significant variation in infection-rate and death-ratio. We have previously shown a presence of a possible relationship between different variables including the Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine, average age, gender, and malaria treatment, and the rate of spread, severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease. This paper focuses on developing machine learning models for this relationship. METHODS: We have used real-datasets collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to develop a model from China data as the baseline country. From this model, we predicted and forecasted different countries' daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases and examined if there was any possible effect of the variables mentioned above. RESULTS: The model was trained based on China data as a baseline model for daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. This machine learning application succeeded in modelling and forecasting daily confirmed-cases and daily death-cases. The modelling and forecasting of viral spread resulted in four different regions; these regions were dependent on the malarial treatments, BCG vaccination, weather conditions, and average age. However, the lack of social distancing resulted in variation in the effect of these factors, for example, double-humped spread and mortality cases curves and sudden increases in the spread and mortality cases in different countries. The process of machine learning for time-series prediction and forecasting, especially in the pandemic COVID-19 domain, proved usefulness in modelling and forecasting the end status of the virus spreading based on specific regional and health support variables. CONCLUSION: From the experimental results, we confirm that COVID-19 has a very low spread in the African countries with all the four variables (average young age, hot weather, BCG vaccine and malaria treatment); a very high spread in European countries and the USA with no variable (old people, cold weather, no BCG vaccine and no malaria). The effect of the variables could be on the spread or the severity to the extent that the infected subject might not have symptoms or the case is mild and can be missed as a confirmed-case.

The transect structure aims to mimic a representative survey for the location capturing differences by age, gender, urbanicity, and socio-economic levels. Dietary data from 1405 individuals were used to describe snacking patterns and other food consumed at different frequencies; extent of physical activity; and Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference of children, adolescents, and adults. Our results indicate high incidence of SFC across all population age groups, gender, socio-economic levels, and locations. A distinctive finding in relation to studies in high income countries is the prevalence of hunger snacking with 70% identifying hunger as the primary reason for SFC. Apart from hunger, particularly for adolescents, peer influence and social interactions played a significant role in SFC. Dietary behaviors of slum dwellers were characterized by three-quarters of them having SFC together with family members at home. SFC supplemented calories for low-income consumers and complemented calorie intake for high income ones. No significant association with BMI is possibly due to obesogenic SFC being likely offset by lower consumption of non-snack food and higher physical activity among poor and slum dwellers.

We determined using a murine model of allergic asthma whether these mice experienced increased morbidity from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) viral infection and whether blockade of interleukin-4 receptor  (IL-4R), a critical mediator of T(h)2 signalling, improved their outcomes. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were intranasally sensitized with house dust mite antigen (Der p 1) for 2 weeks; the mice were then inoculated intranasally with a single dose of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1). The mice were administered intraperitoneally anti-IL-4R through either a prophylactic or a therapeutic treatment strategy. RESULTS: Infection with pH1N1 of mice sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) led to a 24% loss in weight by day 7 of infection (versus 14% in non-sensitized mice; p < .05). This was accompanied by increased viral load in the airways and a dampened anti-viral host responses to the infection. Treatment of HDM sensitized mice with a monoclonal antibody against IL-4R prior to or following pH1N1 infection prevented the excess weight loss, reduced the viral load in the lungs and ameliorated airway eosinophilia and systemic inflammation related to the pH1N1 infection. CONCLUSION: Together, these data implicate allergic asthma as a significant risk factor for H1N1-related morbidity and reveal a potential therapeutic role for IL-4R signalling blockade in reducing the severity of influenza infection in those with allergic airway disease.","output":"IL-4R blockade reduces influenza-associated morbidity in a murine model of allergic asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Welcome to my weblog.

This review paper thoroughly discussed the utilization of concentrate and bypass fat as dietary supplementation in buffalo feeding, and discussed the effects on performance, fermentation characteristics and general health of buffaloes to give better insight about the potential and challenges of dietary supplementation in buffalo diet. Based on the literature studies, it can be summarized that supplementation of concentrate and bypass fat in buffaloes may overcome the nutritional problems and improve the growth performance, health status, rumen environment and carcass traits. ABSTRACT: With the increase in the global buffalo herd, the use of supplementation in the ruminant feeding has become an important area for many researchers who are looking for an isocaloric and isonitrogenous diet to improve production parameters. In order to improve the performance of the Asian water buffalo, the optimal balance of all nutrients, including energy and protein, are important as macronutrients. Dietary supplementation is one of the alternatives to enhance the essential nutrient content in the buffalo diet and to improve the rumen metabolism of the animal. Researchers have found that supplementation of concentrate and rumen bypass fat could change growth performance and carcass traits without causing any adverse effects on the buffalo growth. Some studies showed that dry matter intake, body condition score and some blood parameters and hormones related to growth responded positively to concentrate and rumen bypass fat supplementation. In addition, changes of feeding management by adding the supplement to the ruminant basal diet helped to increase the profit of the local farmers due to the increased performance and productivity of the animals. Nevertheless, the effects of dietary supplementation on the performance of ruminants are inconsistent. Thus, its long-term effects on the health and productivity of buffaloes still need to be further investigated.","output":"The Impact of Feed Supplementations on Asian Buffaloes: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To determine the incidence of COVID 19 in a series of registered patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, treated by TUR-BT and intravesical BCG. Patients and method: We analysed 127 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, in the medium/high risk group, registered between 2001-2020. The patients and families have been contacted by phone. In this interval, 32 patients deceased (cardiovascular pathologies, non-urologic neoplasia, tumour progression), 95 patients are still alive, 24 women and 71 men. The average age was 61.7 (16-86), the majority being over 50, included in the high-risk group for COVID-19. The patients were resected endoscopically and received a cytostatic instillation within the first 6 hours. Reresection of the tumour bed was practiced in pT1patients. The adjuvant treatment with BCG was used in the induction form at each relapse and maintenance (22 patients), respectively. Until 2005, we used the local strain (Cantacuzino Clinical Institute), after that, the strain from Bulgaria (Calgevax) and Medac (Germany). Results: 95 patients are still alive. Tumour relapses were registered in 34 patients. 3 patients registered tumour progression, resolved through radical cystectomy (2) and irradiation. In 3 cases, upper tract urothelial tumours were registered (nephroureterectomy with perimeatic cystectomy). 63 patients underwent induction treatment, while 22 underwent maintenance treatment. Complications: Intolerance to BCG in 4 patients, BCG cystitis in 5 patients, arthritis in 1 patient, septic status in 2 patients.

Common HCoV seroprevalence increases rapidly during the first five years of life and remains high throughout adulthood. HCoVs are known to have seasonal patterns, with variation in predominant types each year, but more defined measures of seasonality are needed. METHODS: We describe laboratory detection, percent positivity, and seasonality of the four common HCoVs during July 2014 to May 2021 in the United States reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). We also describe age, sex, and co-detection with other respiratory viruses for a subset of specimens available through the Public Health Laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP). We used a method previously validated for respiratory syncytial virus, characterized by a centered 5-week moving average and normalization to peak, to define seasonal inflections, including season onset, peak, and offset. RESULTS: Any HCoV type was detected in 96,336 (3.4%) of 2,487,736 specimens. Predominant common HCoV types fluctuated by surveillance year (Figure 1) and were generally consistent across geographic regions. In a subset of 4,576 specimens with a common HCoV detection, those with type 229E had a higher median age compared to other HCoV types (30.8 versus 24.8 years, p< 0.001), but there were no differences by sex. Influenza was the most commonly co-detected virus. In the last six complete HCoV seasons, onsets ranged from October to November, peaks from January to February, and offsets from April to June; >95% of all HCoV detections occurred within these ranges. The 2020-2021 common HCoV season onset, dominated by types NL63 and OC43, was delayed by approximately two months compared to prior seasons. [Image: see text] Figure 1.

METHOD: A retrospective observational cohort study of prospectively collected data. Adult patients admitted from the ED after receiving intravenous antibiotics for suspected sepsis in the year 2020, were studied. Patients with COVID-19 were excluded. The scores stated above were calculated for each patient. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for each score for the primary outcome measure, all-cause in-hospital mortality. The area under the ROC (AUROC) curves and cut-off points were identified by the statistical software. Scores above the cut-off point were deemed high-risk. The test characteristics of the high-risk groups were calculated. Comparisons were based on the AUROC curve and sensitivity for mortality of the high-risk groups. Previously published cut-off points were also studied. Calibration was also studied. RESULTS: Of the 2594 patients studied, 332 (12.8%) died. The AUROC curve for the REDS score 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72C0.75) was significantly greater than the AUROC curve for the SIRS criteria 0.51 (95% CI 0.49C0.53), p < .0001 and the NEWS2 score 0.69 (95% CI 0.67C0.70), p = .005, and similar to all other scores studied.

DPSCs have promising characteristics including self-renewal capacity, rapid proliferation, colony formation, multi-lineage differentiation, and pluripotent gene expression profile. Nevertheless, genotypic, and phenotypic heterogeneities have been reported for DPSCs subpopulations which may influence their therapeutic potentials. The underlying causes of DPSCs heterogeneity remain poorly understood; however, their heterogeneity emerges as a consequence of an interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic cellular factors.

Purpose of the article: This study investigates banks in 40 European countries to determine whether non-interest income had a significant impact on the bank's profitability and whether the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic influences the form of this relationship. Methods: This study used a linear cross-section model using bank-level data. In the model, the bank's profitability was regressed with the measure of income diversification, controlling for the pandemic's intensity and the state of the country's economy and bank characteristics. Banking data were obtained from the S&P Global MI. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (Hale et al., 2021, pp. 529?538) was the source of pandemic-related variables. Findings & value added: The obtained results indicate that the increases in non-interest income share in the bank's total income have a statistically significant positive impact on profitability for the European banking sector. The dependence of profitability on diversification was stronger with the growing adverse effects of the pandemic. Our results are in line with those for the US banks (Li et al., 2021) and the European Central Bank Banking Supervision's assessment that higher non-interest income has allowed banks' profitability in the euro area to be maintained at a pre-pandemic level (ECB, 2021). In addition, the study contributes to previous literature by testing the impact of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between income diversification and bank profitability in 40 European countries.","output":"Did the COVID-19 pandemic amplify the positive impact of income diversification on the profitability of European banks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The expressive writing method has rarely been proposed in contexts of large-scale upheavals that affect large populations In this study this method was applied as an intervention and tool of investigation during the confinement period in the Lombardy region, the Italian Epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak Sixty-four participants took part in an online expressive writing project, and a total of 167 writings were collected together with some self-report evaluations on emotions and physical sensations A linguistic analysis through two different sets of computerized linguistic measures was conducted on the collected writings in order to study the linguistic markers of emotion regulation and elaboration Results indicated that online expressive writing has helped respondents to get more in touch with the intense emotions that were experienced following the upheavals they witnessed Writing even only once or twice helped, particularly those respondents who had at least one COVID-19 patient among close friends or relatives Their writings showed an intense emotional involvement together with the ability to reflect and reorganize the personal meaning of the events and emotions experienced This study shows that expressive writing can be used in the context of a psychological emergency, both as a powerful instrument to investigate and detect the complex psychodynamic processes underpinning the distress, and as a useful intervention to reduce the negative impact of traumatic events ?

Second, we then analyze the risks and returns of houses in affordable and expensive submarkets allowing for spatial dependence and heterogeneity. We find that houses in the affordable submarkets perform better than houses in the expensive submarkets. Thus, the potential demand for houses in the affordable submarket may aggravate the housing affordability crisis.

Surface imaging using time-of-flight camera is a new, non-invasive, non-contact, radiation-free, and easy-to-use technique that enables tidal volume and respiratory rate measurements. The objectives of the study were to determine the accuracy of Time-of-Flight volume (VT(TOF)) and respiratory rate (RR(TOF)) measurements at the bedside, and to validate its application for spontaneously breathing patients under high flow nasal canula. Data analysis was performed within the ReaSTOC data-warehousing project (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02893462). All data were recorded using standard monitoring devices, and the computerized medical file. Time-of-flight technique used a Kinect V2 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) to acquire the distance information, based on measuring the phase delay between the emitted light-wave and received backscattered signals. 44 patients (32 under mechanical ventilation; 12 under high-flow nasal canula) were recorded. High correlation (r = 0.84; p < 0.001), with low bias (-1.7 mL) and acceptable deviation (75 mL) was observed between VT(TOF) and VT(REF) under ventilation. Similar performance was observed for respiratory rate (r = 0.91; p < 0.001; bias < 1b/min; deviation  5b/min). Measurements were possible for all patients under high-flow nasal canula, detecting overdistension in 4 patients (tidal volume > 8 mL/kg) and low ventilation in 6 patients (tidal volume < 6 mL/kg). Tidal volume monitoring using time-of-flight camera (VT(TOF)) is correlated to reference values. Time-of-flight camera enables continuous and non-contact respiratory monitoring under high-flow nasal canula, and enables to detect tidal volume and respiratory rate changes, while modifying flow. It enables respiratory monitoring for spontaneously patients, especially while using high-flow nasal oxygenation.","output":"Accuracy of noncontact surface imaging for tidal volume and respiratory rate measurements in the ICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the race for a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, pharmaceutical formulation science plays a critical role throughout the development, manufacturing, distribution, and vaccination phases.

It is suggested that H(2)S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development.

In this study, we address the role of Apilimod, a pharmacological inhibitor of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, in the regulation of cardiac pathological fibrotic remodeling and TGF signaling pathway. Methods: The effects of Apilimod treatment on myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy and cardiac function were assessed in vivo in a mouse model of pressure overload-induced heart failure. Primary cardiac fibroblasts and HeLa cells treated with Apilimod as well as genetic mutation of PIKfyve in mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used as cell models. Results: When administered in vivo, Apilimod reduced myocardial interstitial fibrosis development and prevented left ventricular dysfunction. In vitro, Apilimod controlled TGF-dependent activation of primary murine cardiac fibroblasts. Mechanistically, both Apilimod and genetic mutation of PIKfyve induced TGF receptor blockade in intracellular vesicles, negatively modulating its downstream signaling pathway and ultimately dampening TGF response. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings propose a novel function for PIKfyve in the control of myocardial fibrotic remodeling and the TGF signaling pathway, therefore opening the way to new therapeutic perspectives to prevent adverse fibrotic remodeling using Apilimod treatment.","output":"Apilimod alters TGF signaling pathway and prevents cardiac fibrotic remodeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine determinants and consequences of virtual shareholder meetings (VSM). Using a pre-Covid sample of voluntary VSM adopters, we do not find that firms choose the virtual format to avoid shareholders scrutiny. VSM are more frequent among tech firms, and firms traditionally more engaged with shareholders, consistent with the stated objective to increase shareholder participation. Textual analysis of transcripts suggests that VSM are substantially shorter, are less likely to include a business presentation, and, when they do, such presentation is shorter and more generic. VSM are also more likely to exhibit no questions during the Q&A, but conditioned upon having a question, they exhibit the same number of questions and such questions are more negative in tone. The results are similar when using the forced adoption of VSM due to Covid for better identification, except that the properties of the business presentation do not change around such forced adoptions. This suggests that the less frequent, shorter, and more generic presentations among voluntary VSM adopters are a firms choice rather than a byproduct of the virtual format per se. Finally, in both samples (voluntary and forced VSM adopters) the virtual format does not appear to affect market-based proxies for the meetings information content (such as abnormal trading volume and absolute returns). Overall, VSM exhibit less activity on average, consistent with critics concerns, but such reduced activity does not appear to cause a loss in information content nor to reflect an attempt to avoid scrutiny.","output":"Virtual Shareholder Meetings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This edited collection compares and analyses the most prominent political communicative responses to the outbreak and global spread of the COVID-19 strain of coronavirus within 27 nations across five continents and two supranational organisations: the EU and the WHO.

At low pH, binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release. Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV.

We adopted the technique of totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction in women who required right colon resection. METHODS Over a 2-year period, 14 women were scheduled for totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis and transvaginal colon removal. The indications for surgery included malignant (n=9) and benign (n=5) right-side colon pathology. RESULTS The procedure was accomplished laparoscopically in all patients. In 1 patient, the transvaginal removal was not possible because of a large tumor mass. The American Society of Anesthesiology was III in 13 and II in 1 patient. The mean body mass index was 31.65. Seventy-eight percent of patients had undergone abdominal surgery previously. The mean size of the lesion was 3.75 cm (range, 1.8 to 8.0 cm) and the mean number of lymph nodes was 18.7 (range, 8 to 37). All margins in the resected specimens were macroscopically and microscopically free of any tumor. One patient needed reoperation for intra-abdominal bleeding, whereas 3 patients developed postoperative ileus. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction is a safe and effective procedure that can be added to the armamentarium of surgeons performing laparoscopic colon surgery. This technique may provide both an attractive way to reduce abdominal wall morbidity and a bridge to pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for colon surgery.","output":"Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with transvaginal colon extraction using a laparoscopic posterior colpotomy: a 2-year series from a single institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To study the impact of a 60-day pilot of an innovative virtual care model using General Internal Medicine physicians and nurses to rapidly respond to over 1200 COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal PCR tests.

However, the full impact of these cardiovascular risk factors is still under investigation. This study aimed to investigate the association between patients' level of cardiovascular risk and the severity of COVID-19. Materials and methods This observational study included all adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital from March 20 to May 10, 2020. The cardiovascular risk level was assessed by the doctor responsible for each patient based on the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines. We examined the association between the patients' level of cardiovascular risk and their severity of COVID-19 disease by using a logistic regression model. Results Among 133 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 46.6% had a low cardiovascular risk level, 19.5% had a moderate risk level, 15.8% had a high risk level, and 18.1% was found to have a very high risk level. Patients with different cardiovascular risk levels had significantly different rates of complications including secondary infection (p-value: <0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p-value = 0.017), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p-value: <0.001), and death (p-value: <0.001).

However, some anastomosis-related surgical complications have been reported. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of modified Delta-SA, called intracorporeal triangular anastomotic technique (INTACT), in this study. METHODS From January 2010 to May 2018, we identified patients who underwent TLDG B-I with INTACT (n = 289) and Delta-SA (n = 221). Using one-to-one propensity score matching, surgical outcomes and gastrointestinal function were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After one-to-one propensity score matching, 177 pairs of INTACT and Delta-SA patients were selected. Patient background was closely balanced between the two groups. Operative time (186 [159, 213] min vs. 237 [213, 264] min; P < 0.001), estimated blood loss (0 [0, 10] g vs. 20 [0, 50] g; P < 0.001), and postoperative hospital stay (7 [7, 9] days vs. 10 [9, 13] days; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the INTACT group than in Delta-SA group. There were no patients with postoperative leakage in the INTACT group and three patients in the Delta group (0.0% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.041).

Other than contact tracing, genome sequencing provides information to help infer who infected whom. However, the effectiveness of the genomic approach in this context depends on both (high enough) mutation and (low enough) transmission rates. Today, the level of resolution that we can obtain when describing SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks using just genomic information alone remains unclear. In order to answer this question, we sequenced 49 SARS-CoV-2 patient samples from ten local clusters for which partial epidemiological information was available, and inferred transmission history using genomic variants. Importantly, we obtained high-quality genomic data, sequencing each sample twice and using unique barcodes to exclude cross-sample contamination. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses showed that consensus genomes were generally sufficient to discriminate among independent transmission clusters. However, levels of intrahost variation were low, which prevented in most cases the unambiguous identification of direct transmission events. After filtering out recurrent variants across clusters, the genomic data were generally compatible with the epidemiological information but did not support specific transmission events over possible alternatives. We estimated the effective transmission bottleneck size to be 1-2 viral particles for sample pairs whose donor-recipient relationship was likely. Our analyses suggest that intrahost genomic variation in SARS-CoV-2 might be generally limited and that homoplasy and recurrent errors complicate identifying shared intrahost variants. Reliable reconstruction of direct SARS-CoV-2 transmission based solely on genomic data seems hindered by a slow mutation rate, potential convergent events, and technical artifacts. Detailed contact tracing seems essential in most cases to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission at high resolution.","output":"Limited genomic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission history within local epidemiological clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microalgae are multifaceted photosynthetic microorganisms with emerging business potential.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been listed as an international public health emergency. Clinical first-line nurses are at a high risk of infection, and they face a lack of experience and inadequate preparation for COVID-19, leading to physical and psychological disorders. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from January to February 2020 at a COVID-19-designated hospital in Wuhan, China. Thirty nurses were selected for the study using a purposive sampling method. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Two main categories were defined in the study from the perspective of nurses: negative experiences during clinical first-line work and positive impacts of clinical first-line work. Under the first category, two subcategories were included: psychological experiences of clinical first-line work and difficulties faced during clinical first-line work. The analysis further yielded two subcategories for the second category: the needs of clinical first-line work and the impact of clinical first-line work on professional attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that success depends upon strengthening emergency training and knowledge of infectious diseases for nurses, providing adequate protective equipment and improving the emergency response plans of hospitals for public health emergencies.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this phase 1, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients with AUD-related cirrhosis with problem drinking (AUDIT-10 > 8) were randomized 1:1 into receiving one placebo or FMT enema from a donor enriched in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Six-month safety was the primary outcome. Alcohol craving questionnaire, alcohol consumption (urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine), quality of life, cognition, serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, plasma/stool short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and stool microbiota were tested at baseline and day 15. A 6-month follow-up with serious adverse event (SAE) analysis was performed. Twenty patients with AUD-related cirrhosis (65  6.4 years, all men, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 8.9  2.7) with similar demographics, cirrhosis, and AUD severity were included. Craving reduced significantly in 90% of FMT versus 30% in placebo at day 15 (P = 0.02) with lower urinary ethylglucuronide/creatinine (P = 0.03) and improved cognition and psychosocial quality of life. There was reduction in serum IL-6 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and increased butyrate/isobutyrate compared with baseline in FMT but not placebo. Microbial diversity increased with higher Ruminococcaceae and other SCFAs, producing taxa following FMT but not placebo, which were linked with SCFA levels. At 6 months, patients with any SAEs (8 vs. 2, P = 0.02), AUD-related SAEs (7 vs. 1, P = 0.02), and SAEs/patient (median [interquartile range], 1.5 [1.25] vs. 0 [0.25] in FMT, P = 0.02) were higher in placebo versus FMT. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 1 trial shows that FMT is safe and associated with short-term reduction in alcohol craving and consumption with favorable microbial changes versus placebo in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis with alcohol misuse.

Our research group hypothesizes the use of this immunotherapy system against SARS-CoV2, admitting the appropriate adjustments concerning the target-epitope and a possible remodeling of the nuclease related to the action of this virus. For a more in-depth analysis of this hypothesis, a mathematical model has been developed which, starting from the fractional derivative Caputo, creates a system of equations that describes the interactions between CAR-T cells, memory cells, and cells infected with SARS-CoV2. Through an analysis of the existence and non-negativity of the solutions, the hypothesis is stabilized; then is further demonstrated through the use of the piece-wise derivative and the consequent application of the formula of Newton polynomial interpolation.","output":"Piecewise differentiation of the fractional order CAR-T cells-SARS-2 virus model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade there has been a renewed global commitment towards building people-centred healthcare systems and enhancing the capture of patient complaints.

Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) infection was diagnosed by PCR, culture in Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium, and immunohistochemistry. Abnormal clinicopathological results included increased alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase, serum gamma glutamyl transferase and polyclonal gammpathy. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence antibody test and western blot using L. infantum antigen. Immunoreactivity against the 16 kDa specific L. infantum antigen fraction was observed by western blot. PCR performed in blood samples obtained from this patient after positive parasite isolation detected L. infantum DNA. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first diagnosis and isolation of L. infantum in a domestic ferret naturally infected in an endemic region (Spain) where canine and feline leishmaniosis is frequently detected. According to these findings, ferrets should be included as potential reservoir hosts of L. infantum.

We used a statewide client survey in Minnesota to determine needs and priorities of food pantry clients in 2017 and 2019 and to identify how well Minnesota pantries met those needs in 2019. METHODS: Our survey was administered in 2017 and 2019. Food pantries in Minnesota were mailed 25 surveys each, with instructions for administering the surveys anonymously to clients. Descriptive analyses compared 2017 and 2019 data and compared client priorities for foods and services with how often they were available at the pantry in 2019. RESULTS: The 2017 survey represented 4,321 clients from 188 pantries; the 2019 survey represented 5,529 clients from 220 pantries. Most measures of food pantry use were consistently high across the years; about three-quarters of clients had been visiting the pantry for a year or more. In 2019, 85% of clients said it was important to have fresh fruits and vegetables, but only 52% said these were always available. About two-thirds had a household member with a diet-related chronic disease. The ability to choose their own foods was clients top priority.

The main objective of the present study was to perform a detailed assessment of scleroderma patients diet as well as their eating habits and to describe the relationships with weight loss and malnutrition risk in the absence of professional nutritional counseling. Methods: We used a translated and validated version of the EPIC-Norfolk FFQ (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire) to evaluate the patients diet and MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool) to investigate the risk of malnutrition. Disease activity was estimated using the EUSTAR-AI (European Scleroderma Trials and Research group Activity Index).

The present study was designed to determine the feasibility and safety of robotic VEG-DFT. METHODS After robotic PG, seromuscular flaps were extracorporeally created at the anterior wall of the remnant stomach through a small umbilical incision. Then, using a robot, the posterior wall of the esophagus was fixed to the cranial end of the mucosal window, and layer-to-layer sutures were placed between the anterior aspects of esophagus and the remnant stomach. Finally, the anastomosis was covered by seromuscular flaps. Short-term outcomes of 12 consecutive patients who underwent VEG-DFT between January 2014 and December 2015 were assessed. RESULTS Operations were successfully completed using robotic assistance in all patients. Median operative, surgeon console, and anastomosis times were 406 (324-613 min), 267 (214-483), and 104 (76-186) min, respectively, and median estimated blood loss was 31 (5-130) ml. The first six cases were required to reach a learning plateau. Both mortality and morbidity rates within 30 days after surgery were 0%. Postoperative hospital stay was 10 (9-30) days. No postoperative reflux esophagitis was observed, whereas anastomotic stenosis, which required endoscopic balloon dilation, developed in three patients (25%) in postoperative month 2. There was a significant association between the total number of stitches used for VEG-DFT and anastomotic stenosis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Robotic assistance may be useful for VEG-DFT with a short learning curve.

METHODS: : This study analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the PsyCorona Survey that included 54,845 participants from 112 countries, of which 23,278 participants are representative samples of 24 countries in terms of gender and age. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing. RESULTS: : All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised =-0.171, median SE=0.004, P<0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised =-0.214, SE=0.029, P<0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress. Among the 54 multilevel linear regressions of mental health on risk perception and emotion, 42 models showed a strong mediation effect, where no significant direct effect of risk perception was found after controlling for emotion (P>0.05).

Although an optimal medical treatment of COVID-19 remains uncertain, an unprecedented global effort to develop an effective vaccine hopes to restore pre-pandemic conditions. Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing phase 3 randomised clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, we encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines and immunisation rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation from other vaccine trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus) showed a favourable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, healthcare authorities should prioritise vaccinations for cancer patients, with the time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis.

However, due to the uniqueness of the recent situation, neurosurgical centers, especially those located in low-resource settings, are facing several challenges such as a lack of coordination, poor equipment, and shortage of medical personnel. Therefore, several guidelines from local authorities and international neurosurgical bodies have been published to help clinicians manage their patients. In addition, the academic health system (AHS), which is an integrated system containing a medical institution, universities, and a teaching hospital, may play some role in the management of patients during COVID-19. The objective of this study was to describe how each hospital in the authors' network adjusted their neurosurgical practice and how the AHS of the Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) played its role in the adaptation process during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors gathered both local and national data about the number of COVID-19 infections from the government's database. To assess the contribution of the AHS to the efforts of each hospital to address the pandemic, questionnaires were given to 6 neurosurgeons, 1 resident, and 2 general surgeons about the management of neurosurgical cases during the pandemic in their hospitals.

The hospitals were grouped into three categories based on the transmission risk in each region. Most of these hospitals stated that UGM AHS had a positive impact on the changes in their strategies. In the early phase of the outbreak, some hospitals faced a lack of coordination between hospitals and related stakeholders, inadequate amount of personal protective equipment (PPE), and unclear regulations. As the nation enters a new phase, almost all hospitals had performed routine screening tests, had a sufficient amount of PPE for the medical personnel, and followed both national and international guidelines in caring for their neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: The management of neurosurgical procedures during the outbreak has been a challenging task and a role of the AHS in improving patient care has been experienced by most hospitals in the authors' network. In the future, the authors expect to develop a better collaboration for the next possible pandemic.","output":"The adjustment of neurosurgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital as a part of an academic health system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective Neurosurgery departments worldwide have been forced to restructure their training programs due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training in Southeast Asia. Methods We conducted an online survey among neurosurgery residents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand from 22 to 31 May 2020 using Google Forms. The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. Results A total of 298 out of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median=100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (p <.001). For emergency operations, trainees in Indonesia and Malaysia had a significantly greater reduction in their caseload (median=80% and 70%, respectively) compared with trainees in Singapore and Thailand (median=20% and 50%, respectively, p <.001). Neurosurgery residents were most concerned about the decrease in their hands-on surgical experience, uncertainty in their career advancement, and occupational safety in the workplace. Most of the residents (221, 74%) believed that the COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on their neurosurgical training overall. Conclusions An effective national strategy to control COVID-19 is crucial to sustain neurosurgical training and to provide essential neurosurgical services. Training programs in Southeast Asia should consider developing online learning modules and setting up simulation laboratories, to allow trainees to systematically acquire knowledge and develop practical skills during these challenging times.","output":"COVID-19s Impact on Neurosurgical Training in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academic research has yet to provide a comprehensive view on how to capture individuals attention when a promotional e-mail reaches their inbox.

In addition to respiratory manifestations, COVID-19 patients with neurological and myocardial dysfunctions exhibit a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The immune function tends to be affected by cardiovascular risk factors and is thus indirectly related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Many neurological symptoms and manifestations have been reported in COVID-19 patients; however, detailed descriptions on the prevalence and characteristic features of these symptoms are restricted due to insufficient data. It is thus advisable for clinicians to be vigilant for both cardiovascular and neurological manifestations to detect them at an early stage to avoid inappropriate management of COVID-19 and to address the manifestations adequately. Patients with severe COVID-19 are notably more susceptible to developing cardiovascular and neurological complications than non-severe COVID-19 patients.

The mechanisms underlying this difference remain unclear. Methods: We compared the immunological landscape between COVID-19 and two other contagious respiratory illnesses (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) by clustering analysis of the three diseases based on 27 immune signatures' scores. Results: We identified three immune subtypes: Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, which displayed high, medium, and low immune signatures, respectively. We found 20%, 35.5%, and 44.5% of COVID-19 cases included in Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, respectively; all influenza cases were included in Immunity-H; 66.7% and 33.3% of RSV cases belonged to Immunity-H and Immunity-L, respectively. These data indicate that most COVID-19 patients have weaker immune signatures than influenza and RSV patients, as evidenced by 22 of the 27 immune signatures having lower enrichment scores in COVID-19 than in influenza and/or RSV. The Immunity-M COVID-19 patients had the highest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and lowest viral loads and were the youngest. In contrast, the Immunity-H COVID-19 patients had the lowest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and highest viral loads and were the oldest. Most immune signatures had lower enrichment levels in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU patients. Gene ontology analysis showed that the innate and adaptive immune responses were significantly downregulated in COVID-19 versus healthy individuals.

The end result is a lone incision at the umbilicus for a perceived scarless abdomen. We report our early experience using the SILS technique for appendectomies in the pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on our first patients to undergo SILS appendectomy (SILS-A) or laparoscopic appendectomy (LAP-A) during the same period at a freestanding children's hospital. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were reviewed. Nineteen patients underwent SILS-A (8.7 +/- 0.76 [SEM] years old), and 20 patients underwent LAP-A (10.5 +/- 0.87 years old, 2-17). Ages were 19 months to 14 years in the SILS-A group, with 21% (4 patients) not older than 6 years. Median weight for SILS-A was 32 kg (14.5-80.3). Twelve patients had acute nonperforated appendicitis (62%). Mean duration of operation was 58 +/- 5.6 (30-135) minutes vs 43 +/- 3.6 (30-85) minutes for standard LAP-A. Two patients were converted to a transumbilical appendectomy, one for inability to maintain a pneumoperitoneum and one for extensive adhesions. Postoperative complications consisted of one wound seroma. No wound infections, hernias, readmissions, or difference in length of stay were noted. CONCLUSION The SILS approach for acute appendicitis is feasible in the pediatric population even in patients as young as 19 months. Operating room times are somewhat longer than with LAP-A, but should decrease with improved instrumentation and experience. Larger studies and further technical refinements are needed before its widespread implementation.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic surgery: feasibility for pediatric appendectomies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people relied on their faith as one resource in order to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In late spring, a number of Northern Hemisphere countries were in a transition period from lockdown to a new normality. Malta, a European country, praised by the Commonwealth General Secretary as the country that has done the best in the whole of Europe was also at this stage. The aim was to summarise the transition period in Malta while describing the different transition phases and interventions adopted to return to a new normality. SUBJECT AND METHOD: A literature search was conducted using Google search engines and Maltese online newspapers. RESULTS: Up till 21 June 2020, a total of 665 cases were identified, with 40 cases being active and nine deaths. Eight weeks after the first reported COVID-19 case, the first transition phase with relaxation of some lockdown measures came into effect. A spike in positive cases was observed after this phase. The second and third transition phases followed suite in 2 week intervals, at the end of which all services were re-opened. However, the travel ban was to be lifted on 1 July 2020. Of note, the number of positive cases remained relatively low after the latter two transition phases. CONCLUSION: Maltas COVID-19 response team managed to contain the first wave following an all-of-society and all-of-government approach. The healthcare system was equipped with an adequate number of beds and ventilators. The three transition phases instituted have shifted the Maltese population from a partial lockdown to a new normality with low fluctuating COVID-19 daily positive cases during the transition period.","output":"COVID-19: the transition towards a new normalexperiences from the European country of Malta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-Cov-2 and the manifestations of this infection range from an absence of symptoms all the way up to severe disease leading to death. To estimate the prevalence of past infection in a population, the most readily available method is the detection of antibodies against the virus. This study has investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of the Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo city (Brazil), which is a large university hospital belonging to the public health system that cares for patients with complex diseases who need tertiary or quaternary medical care. Our serological inquiry was carried out for 6 weeks, with once-a-week blood sampling and included 439 patients from several outpatient services. Overall, 61 patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (13.9%); 56.1 % of the patients live in Sao Paulo city, with the remaining living in other towns of the metropolitan area; 32.8% of the patients testing positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, 55.7% developed mild or moderate disease and 11.5% had to be hospitalized. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was lower among patients who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to the ones who did not. These findings may indicate that those individuals care more about health issues, and/or that they have a better access to health care and/or a better quality of health care service. The large proportion of patients who were unaware of having had contact with SARS-CoV-2 deserves attention, reflecting the scarcity of tests performed in the population.","output":"Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of a large public university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Patients with polycythemia vera (PV) show an elevated incidence of thromboembolic complications and decreased survival when compared to age-matched healthy individuals. Hypercellularity as indicated by elevated hematocrit, pathophysiological changes induced by the JAK2 driver mutation and cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the increased incidence of thromboembolic events. Higher age and a history of thromboembolic events define a high-risk population of PV patients. Depending on the individual risk profile, phlebotomy or pharmacologic cytoreduction is recommended in combination with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid. Stringent cytoreduction is required for effective risk reduction. However, in recent reports, the rate of thromboembolic complications in PV patients under cytoreductive therapy appears still elevated compared to healthy individuals. This study reports on a chart review to assess for cytoreductive therapy of 1440 PV patients in real life. METHODS: Forty-two eligible hematologists/oncologists in private practice treating patients with MPN were recruited to participate in a paperCpencil-based survey conducted between January 2019 and March 2020 in Germany. Physicians were asked to report primary documented data obtained from patient charts. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess for patient characteristics, treatment modalities, risk factors and thromboembolic complications. RESULTS: Data were collected from the patient charts of 1440 individuals diagnosed with PV. The patient population was older than those reported in multicenter trials with a median age of 72.2 years at the time of reporting and 63.5 years at diagnosis. Age was the main factor accounting for high-risk status with 84.7% of patients being above the age of 60 followed by thromboembolic complications reported in 21.3% of patients. The use of pharmacologic cytoreduction was highly variable between participating centers with an average of 60.7% and a range of 10.1C100%. Hydroxyurea was the most frequently used drug followed by ruxolitinib, while interferons were reported for a minority of patients. For 35.4% of patients a persistent need for phlebotomy in addition to cytoreductive treatment was reported. Although presence of high-risk criteria and insufficient disease control were reported as main triggers to initiate pharmacologic cytoreduction, 28.1% had elevated hematocrit values (> 45%) and 38.6% showed persistence of elevated leukocyte count (> 10(9/l)) while on cytoreductive treatment. In contrast, physician-reported symptom burden was lower than published in clinical trials and patient-reported outcomes. The rate of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications was 32.2% at any time and 14.3% after diagnosis with most patients receiving acetylsalicylic acid and 10.8% remaining on oral anticoagulants or heparin. CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreductive treatment of high-risk PV in real life is highly variable regarding indication for cytoreduction and definition of therapy resistance. This study highlights the need for (i) improved risk stratification for thromboembolic events, (ii) consequent indication of pharmacologic cytoreduction in high-risk PV and (iii) attention to signs of therapy resistance that can trigger an earlier and stringent switch to second line agents.","output":"Cytoreductive treatment in real life: a chart review analysis on 1440 patients with polycythemia vera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) residents, especially those who were Black or with dementia, had the highest infection rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 9-week COVID-19 infection control intervention in 360 Massachusetts NHs showed adherence to an infection control checklist with proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use and cohorting was associated with declines in weekly infection rates. NHs were offered weekly webinars, answers to infection control questions, resources to acquire PPE, backup staff, and SARS-CoV-2 testing. We asked whether the effect of this intervention differed by racial and dementia composition of the NHs. METHODS: Data were obtained from 4 state audits using infection control checklists, weekly infection rates, and Minimum Data Set variables on race and dementia to determine whether adherence to checklist competencies was associated with decline in average weekly rates of new COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Using a mixed-effects hurdle model, adjusted for county COVID-19 prevalence, we found the overall effect of the intervention did not differ by racial composition, but proper cohorting of residents was associated with a greater reduction in infection rates among facilities with 20% non-Whites (n = 83). Facilities in the middle (>50%C62%; n = 121) and upper (>62%; n = 115) tertiles of dementia prevalence had the largest reduction in infection rates as checklist scores improved.

We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs, and that WT and 382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2-O-methylated. 2-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 2-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome.

In this report, we investigated the prevalence and reasons for vaccine hesitancy, as well as potential risk factors, within older adolescents and young adults in China. METHODS: To assess these issues, an online survey was administered over the period from March 14 to April 15, 2021. Older adolescents (16C17 years old) and young adults (18C21 years old) were recruited nationwide from Wechat groups and results from a total of 2,414 respondents were analyzed. Socio-demographic variables, vaccine hesitancy, psychological distress, abnormal illness behavior, global well-being and social support were analyzed in this report. RESULTS: Compared to young adults (n = 1,405), older adolescents (n = 1,009) showed higher prevalence rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (16.5 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.001). History of physical diseases (p = 0.007) and abnormal illness behavior (p = 0.001) were risk factors for vaccine hesitancy among older adolescents, while only a good self-reported health status (p = 0.048) was a risk factor for young adults. Concerns over COVID-19 vaccine side effects (67.1%) and beliefs of invulnerability regarding infection risk (41.9%) were the most prevalent reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Providing evidence on the vaccine reduction of COVID-19 infection risk (67.5%), ensuring vaccine safety (56.7%) and the low risk of side effects (52.7%) were the most effective persuasions for promoting vaccinations.

Remarkably, the biochemical and morphological properties of the final -synuclein aggregates significantly differed between PD and MSA seeded samples. Here, these aggregates were given to neuron-like differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and distinct inflammatory responses were observed.

However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO2 emissions, with consequent high-risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues; the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO2 captured in the growth of biomass equates to one ton of CO2 sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO2 is emitted by variable amounts during the life cycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political, and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?","output":"Can biomass supply meet the demands of BECCS?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spread of pathogens on contaminated surfaces plays a key role in disease transmission. Surface technologies that control pathogen transfer can help control fomite transmission and are of great interest to public health.

We show that this method meets several important criteria for quantitative test methods, including reasonableness, relevancy, resemblance, responsiveness, and repeatability, and therefore may be adaptable for standardization. In addition, this method can be applied to a wide variety of pathogens including bacteria, phage, and human viruses. Using the bead transfer method, we demonstrate that an engineered micropattern limits transfer of Staphylococcus aureus by 97.8% and T4 bacteriophage by 93.0% on silicone surfaces. Furthermore, the micropattern significantly reduces transfer of influenza B virus and human coronavirus on silicone and polypropylene surfaces.

As such, the possibility of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. We describe an investigation of two instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual. METHODS: A 25-year-old man who was a resident of Washoe County in the US state of Nevada presented to health authorities on two occasions with symptoms of viral infection, once at a community testing event in April, 2020, and a second time to primary care then hospital at the end of May and beginning of June, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation and twice during follow-up. Nucleic acid amplification testing was done to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Sequence data were assessed by two different bioinformatic methodologies. A short tandem repeat marker was used for fragment analysis to confirm that samples from both infections came from the same individual. FINDINGS: The patient had two positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, the first on April 18, 2020, and the second on June 5, 2020, separated by two negative tests done during follow-up in May, 2020. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences between each variant associated with each instance of infection. The second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first. INTERPRETATION: Genetic discordance of the two SARS-CoV-2 specimens was greater than could be accounted for by short-term in vivo evolution. These findings suggest that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases. All individuals, whether previously diagnosed with COVID-19 or not, should take identical precautions to avoid infection with SARS-CoV-2. The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application.

However, the claim lacks empirical research, and seems counterintuitive when the broader literature on the association between introversion and mental health is considered. The current study investigated whether the psychological impact of COVID19-related circumstantial changes was moderated by introversion, based on outcome measures across psychosocial, cognitive, and affective domains. The role of several demographic factors in determining COVID19-related mental health symptoms was also examined. One hundred and fourteen individuals (64 USA residents) completed measures of introversion, and reported on the extent to which they experienced loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairments as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes. Results showed that introversion predicted more severe loneliness, anxiety, and depression experienced as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes, but not cognitive impairments. Among the range of demographic factors examined (age, gender, living condition, recent unemployment), living with others (vs. living alone) predicted more severe COVID19-related mental health symptoms. However, these effects were only observed on outcome measures pertaining to anxiety and cognitive impairments, but not loneliness and depression.

To examine these relationships and implications, we exploit spatial variation in exposure to COVID-19 related infections and lockdown measures, along with temporal differences in our outcomes of interest, using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that households exposed to higher COVID-19 case rates or mobility lockdowns experience a significant increase in measures of food insecurity. Examining possible transmission channels for this effect, we find that the spread of the pandemic is associated with significant reductions in labor market participation. For instance, lockdown measures are associated with 6-15 percentage points increase in households' experience of food insecurity. Similarly, lockdown measures are associated with 12 percentage points reduction in the probability of participation in non-farm business activities. These lockdown measures have limited implications on wage-related activities and farming activities. In terms of food security, households relying on non-farm businesses, poorer households, and those living in remote and conflicted-affected zones have experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security.

Methods Between 2017 and 2020, approximately 555 clerkship medical students used our formative role-playing exercise tools. Students independently prepared psychotropic medication study cards and role-played IC during group didactics. Peer and supervisor reviews were not recorded but were discussed as a group. Students completed routine anonymous postclerkship surveys regarding the IC exercise. An enhanced IC curriculum was deployed in 2020, adding a training video and peer/supervisor feedback form. Student feedback and specialty shelf exam scores were reviewed to assess the exercise's effectiveness. Results Surveys indicated satisfaction with the exercise and increased confidence in obtaining IC. Interestingly, the student group that received enhanced IC training had fewer shelf exam failures than those without, perhaps indicating improved fund of psychotropic medication knowledge. Discussion Peer role-playing IC training is well accepted by students, allows practice of essential elements of IC and shared decision-making, and provides an engaging way to improve medication fund of knowledge. Our clerkship has initiated development of an IC objective structured clinical examination station and is adapting the exercise across specialties for longitudinal learning in response to the positive feedback and ease of use. Structured review of psychotropics and peer IC role-playing can be tailored for other specialties, medications, and procedures and further developed for use in pre- and postclerkship education.","output":"Psychotropic Medication Informed Consent: A Cross-Specialty Role-Playing Skill Builder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute presentations of COVID-19 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to severe clinical manifestations including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 infection includes lung fibrosis in a proportion of patients. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a mucin like glycoprotein that has been proposed as a marker of pulmonary epithelial cell injury. We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The association between high KL-6 levels at 12 weeks and persisting CT abnormalities (GGO/fibrosis), is a finding that requires further exploration. Whether KL-6 may help differentiate those patients with persisting dyspnoea due to complications rather than deconditioning or dysfunctional breathing alone, is an important future research question.","output":"Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) as a marker for disease severity and persistent radiological abnormalities following COVID-19 infection at 12 weeks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This papers goal is to develop a scientific methodology of financial risk management of ecologically responsible entrepreneurship for the sustainable development of the green economy.

The primary outcome was a combination of ventilation variables and parameters over the first four calendar days of ventilation, including tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and mortality rates. Between 1 March 2020 and 1 June 2020, 1122 patients were included in the study: 244 (21.3%) normal-weight patients, 531 (47.3%) overweight patients, and 324 (28.8%) obese patients. Most patients received a tidal volume < 8 mL/kg PBW; only on the first day was the tidal volume higher in obese patients. PEEP and driving pressure were higher, and compliance of the respiratory system was lower in obese patients on all four days. Adjunctive therapies for refractory hypoxemia were used equally in the three BMI groups. Adjusted mortality rates were not different between BMI categories.

Because many infectious diseases spread through close contacts, contact tracing is a key tool for case discovery and control. However, although contact tracing has been performed widely, the mathematical understanding of contact tracing has not been fully established and it has not been clearly understood what determines the efficacy of contact tracing. Here, we reveal that, compared with\\"forward\\"tracing---tracing to whom disease spreads,\\"backward\\"tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that even at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically executed contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further transmissions. We also show that---in terms of the number of prevented transmissions per isolation---case isolation combined with a small amount of contact tracing is more efficient than case isolation alone. By demonstrating that backward contact tracing is highly effective at discovering super-spreading events, we argue that the potential effectiveness of contact tracing has been underestimated. Therefore, there is a critical need for revisiting current contact tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms of biases. Our results also have important consequences for digital contact tracing because it will be crucial to incorporate the capability for backward and deep tracing while adhering to the privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms.","output":"The effectiveness of backward contact tracing in networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction COVID-19 in care homes has heightened the risk of staff burnout, undermining already problematic staff retention and low morale There has been an associated proliferation of resources and online initiatives to support frontline workers, however, few of these are directly targeted at the care home workforce Care home workers are highly skilled in caring for people with complex needs, but have very variable levels of formal training, and just over half of care homes in Scotland include registered nurses This project will rapidly collate existing resources and identify, direct from care home workers, their best practice, initiatives, and resources used to support resilience and retention during this pandemic and moving forward Methods 1) Rapid review of care home specific evidence and resources (including published research and social media);2) Online survey of Enabling Research in Care Homes (ENRICH) members across Scotland (n = 55);3) Case studies within six care homes to identify what is working well and what is not in terms of promoting resilience and emotional support Results The rapid review has identified a wide range of resources directed at supporting staff working in care homes;the survey and case studies will provide data on the key learning and resources that have supported staff, and outline the challenges identified There are many resources available but staff do not access these The role of the care home manager is key Key conclusions This comprehensive review of resources and initiatives will make a valuable contribution to policy and practice designed to reduce burnout and foster retention not just in care homes but more widely across health and social care","output":"101 Avoiding Burnout of the Care Home Workforce During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Sharing National Learning and Local Initiatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) of increased intake of arachidonic acid (ARA) on fatty acid status and health outcomes in humans.

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001). The concordance between the two tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), while 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for one while negative for the other). The Ct values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing.","output":"Comparing Nasopharyngeal Swab and Early Morning Saliva for the Identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic is ravaging the world and humankind is facing one of the toughest challenges of this century.

Most arrhythmias are harmful to the heart and can suddenly become life-threatening. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important non-invasive tool in cardiology for the diagnosis of arrhythmias. This work proposes a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically classify different types of arrhythmias from ECG signals. First, the auto-encoder convolutional network (ACN) model is used, which is based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) that automatically learns the best features from the raw ECG signals. After that, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is applied to the features learned by the ACN model to improve the detection of arrhythmic beats. This classifier detects four different types of arrhythmias, namely the left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), paced beat (PB), and premature ventricular contractions (PVC), along with the normal sinus rhythms (NSR). Among these arrhythmias, PVC is particularly a dangerous type of heartbeat in ECG signals. The performance of the model is measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and precision using a tenfold cross-validation strategy on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The obtained overall accuracy of the SVM classifier was 98.84%. The result of this model is portrayed as a better performance than in other literary works.

Digitalization is transforming the way of obtaining medical advice and treatment and the Internet has become a key source for the seeking of healthcare information. It has allowed people to turn into more active collaborators in matters of their own health by enabling them to easily search and share information with other patients. Although research points out the growing importance of user-generated content in many sectors and its positive impact on information credibility, trust, engagement, and, ultimately, customer behavior (Malthouse et al., 2016), there is a lack of attention to this topic in healthcare. In this brief review, we address this gap by analyzing the role of health e-mavens, which are a particular type of influencers that possesses both expertise and online social influence. We lastly illustrate possible benefits of their impact on other to the different parties involved and affected by this phenomenon.","output":"Are Health e-Mavens the New Patient Influencers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and thrombotic complications, particularly in severe cases, leading to higher mortality rates. Anticoagulation is the cornerstone to reduce thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. Considering the risk of hepatotoxicity in patients with severe COVID-19 as well as the risk of drugCdrug interactions, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and bleeding, the ANIBAL protocol was developed to facilitate the anticoagulation approach at discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization. However, since the publication of the original algorithm, relevant changes have occurred. First, treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia has been modified with the use of dexamethasone or remdesivir during the first week in patients that require oxygen therapy, and of dexamethasone and/or tocilizumab or baricitinib during the second week in patients that necessitate supplementary oxygen or with a high inflammation state, respectively. On the other hand, metabolic syndrome is common in patients with AF as well as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and this could negatively impact the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, including high transaminase levels in patients treated with immunomodulators. The EHRA guidelines update also introduce some interesting changes in drugCdrug interaction patterns with the reduction of the level of the interaction with dexamethasone, which is of paramount importance in this clinical context. Considering the new information, the protocol, named ANIBAL II, has been updated. In this new protocol, the anticoagulant of choice in patients with AF after COVID-19 hospitalization is provided according to three scenarios: with/without dexamethasone treatment at discharge and normal hepatic function, transaminases 2 times the upper limit of normal, or transaminases >2 times the upper limit of normal.","output":"Dabigatran in patients with atrial fibrillation after COVID-19 hospitalization: an update of the ANIBAL protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies show the effectiveness of interview chatbots for information elicitation. However, designing an effective interview chatbot is non-trivial. Few tools exist to help designers design, evaluate, and improve an interview chatbot iteratively. Based on a formative study and literature reviews, we propose a computational framework for quantifying the performance of interview chatbots. Incorporating the framework, we have developed iChatProfile, an assistive chatbot design tool that can automatically generate a profile of an interview chatbot with quantified performance metrics and offer design suggestions for improving the chatbot based on such metrics. To validate the effectiveness of iChatProfile, we designed and conducted a between-subject study that compared the performance of 10 interview chatbots designed with or without using iChatProfile. Based on the live chats between the 10 chatbots and 1349 users, our results show that iChatProfile helped the designers build significantly more effective interview chatbots, improving both interview quality and user experience.","output":"Designing Effective Interview Chatbots: Automatic Chatbot Profiling and Design Suggestion Generation for Chatbot Debugging"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/40.md","filePath":"drive/40.md"}'),R={name:"drive/40.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
