A few small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro are in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments and more inhibitors are being developed. One limiting factor for 3CLpro inhibitors development is that the cellular activities of such inhibitors have to be evaluated in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) or BSL-4 laboratory. Here, we design genetically encoded biosensors that can be used in BSL-2 laboratories to set up cell-based assays for 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. The biosensors were constructed by linking a green fluorescent protein (GFP2) to the N-terminus and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc8) to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with the linkers derived from the cleavage sequences of 3CLpro. After over-expression of the biosensors in HEK293 cells, 3CLpro can be released from GFP2 and RLuc by self-cleavage, resulting in a decrease of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. Using one of these biosensors, pBRET-10, we evaluated the cellular activities of several 3CLpro inhibitors. These inhibitors restored the BRET signal by blocking the proteolysis of pBRET-10, and their relative activities measured using pBRET-10 were consistent with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities reported previously. We conclude that the biosensor pBRET-10 is a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. Furthermore, our strategy can be used to design biosensors for other viral proteases that share the same activation mechanism as 3CLpro, such as HIV protease PR and HCV protease NS3.

Previous studies hypothesized that this was due to reduced pneumococcal transmission resulting from non-pharmacological interventions. We used multiple ongoing cohort surveillance projects in children <5 years to test this hypothesis. MethodsThe first SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in February-2020, resulting in a full lockdown, followed by several partial restrictions. Data from ongoing surveillance projects captured the incidence dynamics of community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP), non-alveolar lower respiratory infections necessitating chest X-rays (NA-LRI), nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in non-respiratory visits, nasopharyngeal respiratory virus detection (by PCR), and nationwide invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Monthly rates (January-2020 through February-2021 vs. mean monthly rates 2016-2019 [expected rates]) adjusted for age and ethnicity, were compared. FindingsCAAP and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were strongly reduced (incidence rate ratios, [IRRs] 0{eta}07 and 0{eta}19, respectively); NA-LRI and non-pneumonia IPD were also reduced, with a lesser magnitude (IRRs, 0{eta}46 and 0{eta}42, respectively). In contrast, pneumococcal carriage prevalence was only slightly reduced and density of colonization and pneumococcal serotype distributions were similar to previous years. The pneumococcus-associated disease decline was temporally associated with a full suppression of RSV, influenza viruses, and hMPV, often implicated as co-pathogens with pneumococcus. In contrast, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza activities were within or above expected levels.

implantation in the COVID-19 era, with the broader goal of minimizing the period of auditory deprivation in prelingually deaf children and reducing the risk of cochlear ossification in individuals following meningitis. METHODS: The study design comprised 1) an objective assessment of mastoid drilling-induced droplet spread conducted during simulated cochlear implant (CI) surgery and its mitigation via the use of a protective drape tent and 2) an evaluation of three PPE configurations by otologists while performing mastoid drilling on ex vivo temporal bones. The various PPE solutions were assessed in terms of their impact on communication, vital physiological parameters, visual acuity and fields, and acceptability to surgeons using a systematic risk-based approach. RESULTS: Droplet spread during simulated CI surgery extended over 2 m, a distance greater than previously reported. A drape tent significantly reduced droplet spread. The ensemble of a half-face mask and safety spoggles (foam lined safety goggles) had consistently superior performance across all aspects of clinical usability. All other PPE options were found to substantially restrict the visual field, making them unsafe for microsurgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this preclinical study indicate that the most viable solution to enable the safe conduct of CI and other mastoid surgery is a combination of a filtering facepiece (FFP)3 mask or half-face respirator with safety spoggles as PPE. Prescription spoggles are an option for surgeons who need to wear corrective glasses to operate. A drape tent reduces droplet spread.

Because the family income data for this project are rarely used, we validate this timely measure of income by comparing historical estimates that rely on these data to estimates from data on income and consumption that have been used much more broadly. Our results indicate that at the start of the pandemic, government policy effectively countered its effects on incomes, leading poverty to fall and low percentiles of income to rise across a range of demographic groups and geographies. Simulations that rely on the detailed CPS data and that closely match total government payments made show that the entire decline in poverty that we find can be accounted for by the rise in government assistance, including unemployment insurance benefits and the Economic Impact Payments. Our simulations further indicate that of those losing employment the vast majority received unemployment insurance, though this was less true early on in the pandemic and receipt was uneven across the states, with some states not reaching a large share of their out of work residents.

METHODS Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent the laparoscopic excision of CDC and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Between October 2003 and November 2007, we performed laparoscopic CDC excision in 9 patients (8 female and 1 male). Median age was 4 years (range, 8 months to 16 years). There were 7 type I and 2 type IV cysts, according to Todani's classification. Average cyst size was 4.4 cm (range, 1.3-8.5). The procedures were performed by utilizing four or five trochars. RESULTS Six of 9 children presented with preoperative pancreatitis, 1 with abdominal pain, 1 with jaundice, and 1 was found incidentally. Three patients required the conversion to laparotomy due to dense adhesions, secondary to pancreatitis. Six patients underwent successful laparoscopic procedures, 5 had complete cyst excisions, and 1 underwent a proximal excision with distal mucosectomy. Of the 3 patients who required conversion, 2 underwent complete excisions; the other underwent a proximal excision, distal mucosectomy. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative bile leak that required an open hepaticojejunostomy revision. Eight patients had an uneventful recovery. Oral feedings were resumed within an average of 3.4 days (range, 2-9). Average time to discharge was 6.1 days (range, 5-12). Average follow-up time was 18 months (range, 4-48). No further laboratory abnormalities were detected in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection of CDC and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in children is an excellent treatment option.

The expression level of LMO3 during the osteogenesis of hADSCs was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Lentivirus transfection was used to knock down or overexpress LMO3, which enabled us to investigate the effect of LMO3 on osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. Wortmannin were used to identify the mechanism of the LMO3/PI3K/Akt axis in regulating osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. Moreover, ectopic bone formation in nude mice was used to investigate the effect of LMO3 on osteogenesis in vivo. In this study, we found the expression of LMO3 was significantly upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. LMO3 knockdown remarkably suppressed osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs, while LMO3 overexpression promoted osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we discovered that the enhancing effect of LMO3 overexpression on osteogenic differentiation was related to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway with wortmannin effectively blocked the stimulation of osteogenic differentiation induced by LMO3 overexpression. In conclusion, based on transcriptomic analysis, we identified key genes involved in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs. In addition, we found that LMO3 might act as a positive modulator of hADSC osteogenic differentiation by mediating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

We describe the impact of booster administration in these patients, amidst a third wave of infections and deaths. Methods In the setting of a prospective COVID-19-centred cohort study in dialysis and kidney transplant patients we examined humoral responses to booster vaccination, and subsequent infection risk. Results We quantified antibodies (DiaSorin) in 198 maintenance dialysis patients, 314 kidney transplant patients and 82 controls, without prior COVID-19 infection. Prior to boosting, 79% of controls, 35% of dialysis and 11% of transplant patients had levels []59 AU/ml (putatively protective), while 8-54 days after a third injection, respective rates were 100%, 93% and 58%. Risk factors for antibodies <60 AU/ml despite booster injection were transplant vs dialysis, OR=18.4 (p<0.0001), transitioning from dialysis to transplantation or vice versa, OR=15.7 (p<0.01) and days post injection, OR=0.953 (p<0.05). Antibody step-up after the booster inversely correlated with the second dose step-up (r=-0.33, p<0.01). In this surge, 2 controls, 2 dialysis and 9 transplant patients had COVID-19.

Conclusions We show that a third dose of tozinameran boosts antibody levels in patients receiving RRT, as it did in controls. Most patients have now reached antibody levels likely to protect from infection. Antibodies were higher after the third dose compared to previous peaks, which may hint that the latest immune response may be more robust and sustainable, even in immune-compromised patients. Kidney transplant recipients showed the most striking enhancement, exhibiting >5.5-fold increase in the percentage of patients with protective antibody levels. However, many transplant patients remain below threshold even after boost injection, necessitating further boosting strategies.","output":"Response to Tozinameran (BNT162b2) booster in twice-vaccinated kidney transplant and maintenance dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, the world faced another of the potentially deadly viruses affecting humanity.

With several mitigation measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19, these impacted on access and utilization of general health services including family planning (FP) services. The objective of the study was to understand the extent to which COVID-19 interrupted access and utilization of FP services as well as highlight the challenges faced during the lockdown in Uganda. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out in August and September 2020 across the country. A total of 21 key informant interviews among researchers, policy makers, funding agencies, district family planning focal persons, district health officers and service providers with implementing partners were conducted. These were conducted using face to face (7), phone calls (11) and zoom (3) meetings. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were used to identify and generate codes, sub themes and themes. Analysis was done using the thematic framework analysis and results presented in themes. RESULTS: Five themes were identified in this study which included; (i) financial and psychosocial needs, (ii) mobility hindrances, (iii) disrupted service delivery, (iv) responsive reproductive health services. The financial and psychosocial needs themes included: household and individual financial constraints, unpredictable future and community acceptance, loss of employment and unemployment, misconceptions and unintended pregnancies; while mobility hindrances included; restricted movement, high transport costs, and difficulty in finding transport. CONCLUSION: Results showed that the pandemic had immediate and significant long-term effects on family planning service accessibility, utilization and delivery.

The mentioned problems can be resolved by using recycled aggregates and industrial waste ashes as natural aggregate and cement replacement in concrete production. Incorporating different by-product ashes and recycled plastic (RP) aggregates are viable options to produce sustainable self-compacting concrete (SCC). On the other hand, compressive strength is an essential characteristic among other evaluated properties. As a result, establishing trustworthy models to forecast the compressive strength of SCC is critical to saving cost, time, and energy. Furthermore, it provides valuable instruction for planning building projects and determining the best time to remove the formwork. In this study, four alternative models were suggested to predict the compressive strength of SCC mixes produced by RP aggregates: the artificial neural network (ANN), nonlinear model, linear relationship model, and multi-logistic model. To do so, an extensive set of data consisting of 400 mixtures were extracted and analyzed to develop the models, various mixture proportions and curing times were considered as input variables. To test the effectiveness of the suggested models, several statistical evaluations, including coefficient of determination (R(2)), scatter index, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Objective (OBJ) value were utilized. Compared to other models, the ANN model performed better to forecast the compressive strength of SCC mixes incorporating RP aggregates. The RMSE, MAE, OBJ, and R(2) values for this model were 5.46 MPa, 2.31 MPa, 4.26 MPa, and 0.973, respectively.

With a view to assessing VLSM's validity, the present study analyzed the technique's ability to determine the known clinical-anatomic correlates of hemiparesis in stroke patients. DESIGN Lesions (damaged in at least 5 patients) associated with transformed limb motor score (after adjustment on lesion volume) at 6 months were examined in 272 patients using VLSM. The value of additional multivariable linear, logistic and Bayesian analyses was examined. RESULTS We first checked that motor hemiparesis was fully accounted for by corticospinal tract (CST) lesions (sensitivity = 100%; p = 0.0001). Conventional VLSM analysis flagged up 2 regions corresponding to the CST, but also 8 regions located outside the CST. All 10 brain regions achieving statistical significance in the VLSM analysis were submitted to 3 additional analyses. The backward linear regression analysis selected 5 regions, one only corresponding to the CST (R2: 0.03, p = 0.0008). The logistic regression analysis selected correctly the CST (OR: 2.39, 95%CI: 1.44-3.96; 0.001). The Bayesian network analysis selected regions including the CST (in 92% of 3000 bootstrap replications) and identified the source of multicollinearity. These lesions evaluated by structural equation modeling resulted in an excellent fit (p-value = 0.228, chi/df = 1.19, RMSEA = 0.032, CFI = 0.999). Analyses of confusion factors showed that conventional VLSM analyses were strongly influenced by lesion frequency (R2 = 0.377; p = 0.0001) and multicollinearity. CONCLUSIONS Conventional VLSM analyses are sensitive but weakened by a type I error due to the combined effects of multicollinearity and lesion frequency. We demonstrate that the addition of a Bayesian network analysis, and to a lesser extent of logistic regression, controlled for this type I error and constituted a reliable means of defining the functional anatomy of the motor system in stroke patients.","output":"Is VLSM a valid tool for determining the functional anatomy of the brain?

After entering into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secretory proteins attain their native structure thanks to specific chaperones and enzymes. Only correctly folded molecules are allowed by quality control (QC) mechanisms to leave the ER and proceed to downstream compartments. Proteins that cannot fold properly are instead retained in the ER to be finally destined to proteasomal degradation. Exiting from the ER requires, in most cases, the use of coated vesicles, departing at the ER exit sites, which will fuse with the Golgi compartment, thus releasing their cargoes. Protein accumulation in the ER can be caused by a too stringent QC or by ineffective transport: these situations could be deleterious for the organism, due to the loss of the secreted protein, and to the cell itself, because of abnormal increase of protein concentration in the ER.

Evolutionary and psychological research has shown that touch is an important part of bond-building and emotion communication; loneliness is intimately related to these elements as well. In this paper, we ask whether physical contact reduces feelings of loneliness -which might derive from evolutionary ancient bonding mechanisms-despite a cultural context that is relatively non-tactile. Method: An experimental study (40 participants, 13 males) tested for observable effects of touch on loneliness scores in a low-contact culture to analyse whether they respond positively to that stimulus despite cultural training against it. Results: Participants exposed to physical contact reported significantly lower neglect scores from their close relationships in a short loneliness scale, thus suggesting that there is an underlying mechanism that persists despite enculturation. The effects were particularly strong among single people, which could mean that lower loneliness among married people might be partly explained by the regular availability of physical contact. Participants in the experimental condition also showed a faster reduction in heart rate, interpreted as a sign of physiological wellbeing. Conclusions: These findings help to specify mechanisms within the evolutionary theoretical framework of loneliness that link internal feelings to environmental cues.

Our model is able to capture the abrupt social habit changes caused by lockdowns.

We employed a thematic analysis of visual surveys and in-depth interviews to understand older adults spatial and cultural context and their experiences using buses in their everyday lives. RESULTS: Boarding and deboarding buses were common barriers for older adults due to overcrowding and traffic congestion. In addition, older adults faced challenges such as ageism, gender discrimination, and undesirable behavior by transport personnel and co-passengers. These barriers affected their independent mobility and influenced their access to work and social life, contributing to their social exclusion.

SARSCoV2 uses its entry-point key residues in S1 protein to attach with human ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV2 evolution comprises any of these possibilities: it entered human from bat with its poorly developed entry-point residues much before its known appearance with slower mutation rate;or recently with efficiently developed entry-point residues having more infective power with higher mutation rate;or through an intermediate host. RaTG13 has 96.3% identity with SARS-CoV2 genome implying that it substituted ~1106 nucleotides to evolute as present-day virus. Temporal analysis of SARS-CoV2 genome from December 2019 shows that its nucleotide substitution rate is as low as 27nt/year with an evolutionary rate of 9x10-4 /site/year, which is a little less than other retrovirus (10-4 to 10-6 /site/year). Estimation of TMRCA of SARS-CoV2 from bat RaTG13 lineage appears to be in between 9-14 years. Furthermore, evolution of a critical entry-point residue Y493Q needs two substitutions with an intermediate virus carrying Y493H (Y>H>Q), although such an intermediate virus has not been identified in known twenty-nine bat CoV virus. Genetic codon analysis indicates that SARS-CoV2 evolution from RaTG13 lineage strictly follows neutral evolution with strong purifying selection whereas its propagation in human disobeys neutral evolution as nonsynonymous mutations surpasses synonymous mutations with the increase of  (dn/ds) signifying its proceedings towards divergent selection predictably for its infection power to evade multiple organs.","output":"Evolutionary Shift from Purifying Selection towards Divergent Selection of SARS-CoV2 Favors its Invasion into Multiple Human Organs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenges of identifying and controlling emerging diseases impact individual health, as well as political, social and economic situations.

Measuring the impacts, however, is difficult because of a lack of data that tracks and compares outcomes and potential protective social factors before and during lockdowns. OBJECTIVE: We aim to quantify the impact of a second lockdown in 2020 in the Australian city of Melbourne on levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, and analyse whether social relations in the neighbourhood may buffer against the worst effects of lockdown. METHODS: We draw on quasi-experimental data from a nationally-representative longitudinal survey conducted in Australia. We use a difference-in-difference approach with a number of control variables to estimate changes in mental health among respondents in Melbourne following the imposition of the lockdown. A measure of perceived neighbourhood social relations is included as an explanatory variable to analyse potential protective effects. RESULTS: Lockdown is estimated to have increased depressive symptoms by approximately 23% and feelings of loneliness by 4%. No effect on anxiety was detected. Levels of neighbourhood social relations were strongly negatively associated with mental health symptoms. A significant interaction between lockdown and neighbourhood social relations suggests that lockdown increased depressive symptoms by 21% for people with average perceived neighbourhood relations, compared with a 9.7% increase for people whose perceived relations is one standard deviation greater than average. CONCLUSION: The results add to evidence of the harsh impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on mental health. Importantly, neighbourhood social relations and social cohesion more broadly may be an important source of social support in response to lockdowns. These findings provide important insights for researchers and policy-makers in how to understand and respond to the mental health impacts of COVID-19.","output":"The longitudinal effect of COVID-19 infections and lockdown on mental health and the protective effect of neighbourhood social relations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2), lysosomal endopeptidase Cathepsin L (CTSL), subtilisin-like proprotein peptidase furin (FURIN), and even potentially membrane bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The distribution and expression of many of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has recently been demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remains unclear. Here, we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes, as well as potential downstream effector genes such as bradykinin receptors, are modulated in the target organs of select disease states. In tissues, such as the heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, we found the increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer, or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and we suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.","output":"Impact of Comorbidities on SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry-Related Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astragaloside IV (ASIV) is the essential active component of astragalus that has diverse biological activities.

ARCHITECT? assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. National COVID-19 surveillance data on the median date of the serosurvey is analyzed for comparison. FINDINGS: : Adjusted seroprevalence was 3.5% (95% CI: 3.2%-3.8%) after controlling for age, sex and test kit performance. Males (3.7%) and females (3.3%) were nearly equally infected, while middle-aged adults 40-65 years had the highest (4.0%) prevalence. Gambella (7.5%), Dire Dawa (6.2%) and Jigjiga (6.1%) were most affected towns. About 6.7% and 8.0% of seropositives had symptoms and chronic underlying illness, respectively. Surveillance system had identified 4,416 RT-PCR confirmed cases in Addis Ababa. INTERPRETATION: : This serosurvey shows majority of urban Ethiopians remain uninfected with SARS-CoV-2. Most anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive cases were asymptomatic with no underlying illness, keeping case detection to a minimum.","output":"Seroprevalence and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 Infection in selected urban areas in Ethiopia: a cross-sectional evaluation during July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a highly morbid lung pathology induced by exposure to chemical warfare agents, including vesicants, phosgene, chlorine, and ricin.

Using a stepwise approach, dose and duration of treatment, drug interactions, warnings and contraindications, adverse effects, and administration points were specified. New drug candidates that may get American and European approvals were also introduced. EXPERT OPINION Despite the wide use of PPIs, their development lags behind the clinical need. There is an absolute requirement to develop third-generation PPIs with higher potency and improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Regarding the antibiotic resistance crisis, including those used against H. pylori, conducting more clinical trials and investigating regional antibiotic resistance are warranted.

The characteristic benefit of nanocrystals lies in their ability to boost the bioavailability of such drugs by enhancing their saturation solubility and dissolution velocity. Nanocrystals can be prepared by either bottom-up or top-down approach. The latter is often preferred due to the feasibility of scale-up and economical nature. Hence the emphasis on these methods.Methods: Stable RIF nanocrystals were developed and optimized using media milling and microfluidizer method by incorporating a suitable surfactant/stabilizer. The developed nanocrystals were evaluated for their saturation solubility, in vitro dissolution, solid-state characteristics, morphology, intrinsic dissolution rate, and short-term physical stability.Results: Both the methods were found to be equally efficient in terms of development of stable RIF nanocrystals, while in terms of processing time and efficacy, microfluidization was found to be advantageous. Amorphization and polymorphic conversion were evident based on the results of solid-state characterization. Furthermore, both formulations exhibited an enhanced solubility and faster dissolution velocity.Conclusions: Based on the characterization outcomes, it can be concluded that both the top-down technologies could be successfully applied to develop nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs.

However, efficacy data and recommendations for its use are limited. METHODS AABB commissioned a panel of experts to develop interim recommendations based on limited data to guide use of this scarce resource. The panel performed a literature review using the search terms \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" and \\"convalescent plasma.\\" The interim recommendations reflect a consensus of expert opinion. INTERIM RECOMMENDATION 1: When making risk benefit decisions, one should consider the risk of CCP as comparable to standard (SARS-CoV-2 non-immune) plasma. INTERIM RECOMMENDATION 2: CCP is optimally effective when transfused as close to symptom onset as possible. CCP is unlikely to provide benefit for patients with late-stage disease or on mechanical ventilation. INTERIM RECOMMENDATION 3: The effectiveness of CCP is related to the antibody quantity within a unit; high-titer CCP is superior to low-titer CCP. A single high-titer unit should be sufficient for most patients. INTERIM RECOMMENDATION 4: If group B or group AB CCP is unavailable, transfusion of group A or group O CCP with low anti-A/B titer may be acceptable for group B and group AB patients. INTERIM RECOMMENDATION 5: Additional randomized controlled trial (RCT) data are needed to fully assess CCP efficacy and to identify which specific patient populations and unit characteristics might confer the greatest benefit.

We include the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. We also explore how changes in search patterns relate to income support policies and to COVID-19 death rates. METHOD: Using Google Trends data and an event-study design, as well as a difference-in-differences analysis, we investigate the association between country specific stay-at-home orders and internet searches including the following words: insomnia, stress, anxiety, sadness, depression, and suicide. RESULTS: We find three main patterns. First, searches for insomnia peak but then decline. Second, searches for stress, anxiety, and sadness increase and remain high throughout the lockdown. Third, there is no substantial change in depression-related or suicide-related searches after the lockdown. In terms of potential mechanisms, our results suggest that searches declined for suicide and insomnia following the passage of each country's income support, while in countries with higher COVID-19-related death rates, searches for insomnia, stress, and anxiety increased by more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in Latin America, Google searches for words associated with mild mental health disorders increased during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders.

First, semi-structured, interviews were conducted with 11 experts in the edible oil industry. Then a cross-sectional study was done on 40 restaurant managers through telephone interviews about the restaurants discarded edible oils. Finally, an online study was undertaken among 121 households regarding their waste cooking oil at home.

A 43-year-old woman, who had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 1 month earlier, developed holocephalic headache, TVOs, and bilateral disc edema. She did not seek medical attention until she developed TVOs. Visual acuity was 20/20 and Humphrey visual field testing showed enlarged blind spots in both eyes. She was diagnosed with papilledema and underwent magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography of the brain, which revealed right transverse sinus thrombosis. Lumbar puncture was performed, showing elevated opening pressure and normal cerebrospinal fluid contents. Her optic disc edema resolved and visual function remained normal 6 weeks following warfarin and topiramate therapy. Recanalization of the right transverse sinus occurred after 3 months. Although rare, TVOs are important presenting symptoms of COVID-19-related CVST.

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 1.5 kb fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 690 nucleotides which was identified as the M protein gene from its homology to BCV. This ORF encodes a protein of 230 amino acids with an M(r) of 26416. The gene is preceded by the motif UCCAAAC, analogous to the consensus coronavirus transcription initiation sequence. The M protein of HCV-OC43 shows features typical of all coronavirus M proteins studied: a hydrophilic, presumably external N terminus including about 10% of the protein, and a potential N-glycosylation site followed by three major hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The amino acid sequence of the M protein of HCV-OC43 has 94% identity with that of the Mebus strain of BCV, and also contains six potential O-glycosylation sites in the exposed N-terminal domain. Indeed, the glycosylation of the M protein was not inhibited in the presence of tunicamycin, which is indicative of O-glycosylation, as previously reported for BCV and murine hepatitis virus. Virions released from tunicamycin-treated cells contained the M glycoprotein but were devoid of both peplomer (S) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins. Thus, inhibition of the N-glycosylation of the S and HE structural proteins prevented their incorporation into progeny virions, an indication that they are dispensable for virion morphogenesis, unlike the M protein.","output":"Sequence analysis of the membrane protein gene of human coronavirus OC43 and evidence for O-glycosylation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oates discusses the one million acres of oil and gas leases in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus uropha-sianus) habitat, granted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which were voided on Feb 27 in a summary judgment by Judge Ronald E Bush, Chief Magistrate, US District Court for Idaho Refunds totaling approximately $125 million are expected Attorney Sarah Stellberg said that preliminary injunction in September 2018 had halted the lease sales The summary judgment decision held that the policy was unlawful, vacating it in sage-grouse habitat Advocates for the West has filed a motion to reconsider with Judge Bush and Western Energy Alliance an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Delays related to the coronavirus pandemic, which have severely complicated many court operations, are not anticipated","output":"Sage\\\\grouse protections prevail over oil and gas leases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic.

Since then, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to a growing number of deaths around the globe, as well as unparalleled economic and sociodemographic consequences. The disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel form of human coronavirus. Although coronavirus infections have been associated with neurological manifestations such as febrile seizures, convulsions, change in mental status, and encephalitis, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with neurological alterations in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical manifestations. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process, as well as the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, are still poorly understood. Glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, play pivotal roles in the brain response to neuroinflammatory insults and neurodegenerative diseases. Further, accumulating evidence has shown that those cells are targets of several neurotropic viruses that severely impact their function. Glial cell dysfunctions have been associated with several neuroinflammatory diseases, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 likely has a primary effect on these cells in addition to a secondary effect from neuronal damage. Here, we provide an overview of these data and discuss the possible implications of glial cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the roles of microglia and astrocytes in brain inflammatory responses, we shed light on glial cells as possible drivers and potential targets of therapeutic strategies against neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. The main goal of this review is to highlight the need to consider glial involvement in the progression of COVID-19 and potentially include astrocytes and microglia as mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurological damage.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and glial cells: Insights and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Associations between the human gut microbiome and expression of host illness have been noted in a variety of conditions ranging from gastrointestinal dysfunctions to neurological deficits.

Market innovation has remained the driving force behind most market expansions and stability in the turbulent nature of global economies. This study sought to establish the influence of market innovation on the competitive advantage of telecommunication companies in Kenya. Design/Method/Approach: Using the philosophy of positivism, the study adopted an explanatory research design in testing the hypothesis. The main data collection instrument was a structured questionnaire using both physical conduct and online interactions to return 247 responses from mid and top level managers in a total of 26 active telecommunications companies in Kenya. The study used both descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS computer application to analyze the data. Findings: From the study findings, it was established that innovative distribution channels significantly influenced the competitive advantage while advertising and promotions did not have a significant influence. This led to the conclusion that market innovation has a significant influence on the competitive advantage of telecommunication companies in Kenya. Practical implications: The study recommends that telecommunication companies need to form collaborations and partnerships for ease of establishing market distribution channels that have indicated to bring influence onto the competitive advantage of the companies. Other recommendations include a wider coverage of the East African market for the telecommunications sector. The study provides insights into new companies with interest in the region. Originality/Value: From the results marketing and promotions are not the only major contributing factor in the competitive advantage but the channels of distribution. Research limitations/Future research: The study faced limitations on having to visit the field during the COVID-19 pandemic period thus encountering the restrictions of entry into premises.

The original components separation technique (CS) has undergone numerous modifications. The aim of this work is to summarise the essential steps of the development. METHODS Based on a literature review, the original technique, the modifications and advancements are presented and evaluated regarding indication, techniques and results. RESULTS The original technique still has a high status, because of the large extent of rectus complex medialisation. Numerous modifications of the anterior conventional component separation with different clinical results were described. The development of a minimally invasive technique with balloon dilatation trocars was an essential step and decreased wound morbidity. The modified posterior component separation by transverse abdominis release currently seems to be an encouraging alternative to be regarded as a widening of the sublay technique. All methods can be combined with implantation of prosthetic or biological implants in intraperitoneal, sublay or onlay technique, whereby the recurrence rate can be decreased. CONCLUSION From where we stand today no single technique can generally be recommended. The latest methods aim for decreasing complications and recurrences by means of minimally invasive procedures. The surgical strategy still depends on the complexity and extent of abdominal wall defect and has to be determined according to individual aspects and sometimes requires an interdisciplinary approach.","output":"[Component separation for closing large abdominal wall defects: evolution of a method from 1990 to present day]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several months ago, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was detected in Wuhan City (China) and the aetiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated by the Chinese authorities as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2).

Using IBV Arkansas-type (Ark) S protein histochemistry, we show that extension of S1 with the S2 ectodomain improves binding to chicken tissues. Although the S1 subunit is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, vaccination with S1 protein has been shown to confer inadequate protection against challenge. The demonstrated contribution of S2 ectodomain to binding to chicken tissues suggests that vaccination with the ectodomain might improve protection compared to vaccination with S1 alone. Therefore, we immunized chickens with recombinant trimeric soluble IBV Ark-type S1 or S-ectodomain protein produced from codon-optimized constructs in mammalian cells. Chickens were primed at 12 days of age with water-in-oil emulsified S1 or S-ectodomain proteins, and then boosted 21 days later. Challenge was performed with virulent Ark IBV 21 days after boost. Chickens immunized with recombinant S-ectodomain protein showed statistically significantly (P < 0.05) reduced viral loads 5 days post-challenge in both tears and tracheas compared to chickens immunized with recombinant S1 protein. Consistent with viral loads, significantly reduced (P < 0.05) tracheal mucosal thickness and tracheal lesion scores revealed that recombinant S-ectodomain protein provided improved protection of tracheal integrity compared to S1 protein. These results indicate that the S2 domain has an important role in inducing protective immunity. Thus, including the S2 domain with S1 might be promising for better viral vectored and/or subunit vaccine strategies.","output":"Protection against infectious bronchitis virus by spike ectodomain subunit vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak was declared as a pandemic in March 2020;this prompted the need for rapid vaccine development. Currently four EMA approved vaccines exist but their efficacy and safety data on patients with Inflammatory Bowel diseases are limited. Methods: Greek IBD patients, from 10 tertiary referral centres, who had completed the initial vaccination protocol with the available anti-COVID-19 vaccines at least two weeks before enrolment, were prospectively studied. Demographic and safety data were collected and blood samples were drawn for serum Anti-S1 IgG measurement [Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG)]. Results: In total 403 IBD patients (59% Crohn's disease, median age 45 years, 53% male) and 124 healthy controls (HC) were included (Table 1). Antibody testing was conducted after a median of 31 (IQR, 23-46) days post-vaccination. Following a full vaccination regimen, 98% of IBD patients seroconverted (anti-S1 IgG11 RU/ ml). Administration of mRNA vaccines resulted in higher seroconversion rates and higher antibody titers than viral vector ones (98.6% vs 93.6%, P=0.02 and 111.2 RU/ml vs 76 RU/ml, P<0.0001, respectively). In total, IBD patients had lower anti-S1 levels than HC (RU/ ml 108 vs 133 RU/ml, P=0.00009). IBD patients without immunosuppression had higher antibody titers than immunocompromised patients (P=0.012). In univariable analysis, older age, longer time since vaccination, and treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti-TNF or combination therapy were associated with lower anti- S1 titers. In contrast, higher anti-S1 levels were detected in patients on vedolizumab monotherapy or non-immunosuppressive treatment. In multivariable analysis, only age, time since vaccination, and anti- TNF therapy remained significant (P=0.011, P=0.002, and P=0.013 respectively). Treatment with vedolizumab monotherapy was associated with higher antibody levels than anti-TNF or ustekinumab monotherapy (P=0.023 and P=0.032). Patients with prior COVID-19 infection showed numerically higher levels of Abs. All vaccines were safe in IBD patients. Conclusion: Patients with IBD have high seroconversion rates to anti- SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with mRNA vaccines being more efficacious. However, IBD patients have impaired response to vaccination comparing to HC. Lower antibody responses were observed in patients who received viral vector vaccines, in older patients, and in those on anti- TNF treatment. It is important to consider booster vaccination in those low-response groups.","output":"Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases on anti-TNF treatment have impaired antibody production after Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: Results from a Panhellenic registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Up to the end of January, 2022, South Africa has had four recognisable COVID-19 pandemic waves, each predominantly dominated by one variant of concern: the ancestral strain with an Asp614Gly mutation during the first wave, the beta variant (B.1.351) during the second wave, the delta variant (B.1.617.2) during the third wave, and lastly, the omicron variant (B.1.1.529) during the fourth wave. We aimed to assess the clinical disease severity of patients admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the omicron wave and compare the findings with those of the preceding three pandemic waves in South Africa. METHODS: We defined the start and end of each pandemic wave as the crossing of the threshold of weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100 000 population. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. We compared disease severity across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of the following: acute respiratory distress, receipt of supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care, or death. FINDINGS: We analysed 335 219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospital admissions with a known outcome, constituting 104% of 3 216 179 cases recorded during the four waves. During the omicron wave, 52 038 (83%) of 629 617 cases were admitted to hospital, compared with 71 411 (129%) of 553 530 in the Asp614Gly wave, 91 843 (126%) of 726 772 in the beta wave, and 131 083 (100%) of 1 306 260 in the delta wave (p<00001). During the omicron wave, 15 421 (336%) of 45 927 patients admitted to hospital had severe disease, compared with 36 837 (523%) of 70 424 in the Asp614Gly wave, 57 247 (634%) of 90 310 in the beta wave, and 81 040 (630%) of 128 558 in the delta wave (p<00001). The in-hospital case-fatality ratio during the omicron wave was 107%, compared with 215% during the Asp614Gly wave, 288% during the beta wave, and 264% during the delta wave (p<00001). Compared with those admitted to hospital during the omicron wave, patients admitted during the other three waves had more severe clinical presentations (adjusted odds ratio 207 [95% CI 201C213] in the Asp614Gly wave, 359 [349C370] in the beta wave, and 347 [338C357] in the delta wave). INTERPRETATION: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in the omicron wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer patients admitted to hospital, less clinically severe illness, and a lower case-fatality ratio compared with the preceding three waves. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile, and deaths in South Africa. Extrapolations to other populations should factor in differing vaccination and previous infection levels.

Mass quarantine had been implemented all around China which could influence the psychological status of patients with memory disorders and their caregivers. AIM: To investigate the psychological impact of mass quarantine on patients with memory disorders and their caregivers in China. METHODS: We completed a cross-sectional study in 787 patients and their caregivers registered from 2010 to 2019 in Memory Clinic, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, by telephone interviews. The performance in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), sleep, nutrition, chronic diseases of patients, and the burden of care, anxiety and depression of caregivers was assessed by six assessment scales (MNA-SF, PSQI, NPI, RSS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7). RESULTS: Only 68 (8.6%) patients worried about the outbreak of COVID-19. The prevalence of NPSs among all subjects was nearly 60.0%. Approximately 50.0% of the caregivers reported distress. More than 70.0% of patients remained stable in NPSs. However, anxiety, depression, aberrant motor disorder and delusion were exacerbated (22.9%, 18.6%, 17.1% and 16.8%, respectively). Appetite and eating disorder led alleviation rate by 25.8% while disappearing rate of agitation led by 5.8%. 7.5% of caregivers manifested depressive symptoms while 4.9% expressed anxiety symptoms, and 40.8% showed care burden.

The trend of aspergillosis significantly increased from 2015 to 2019. Influenza A (H1N1) and ambient PMs (PM(2.5) and PM(10)) levels had significant effects on aspergillosis from 2015 to 2018. However, ambient PMs and influenza A (H1N1) in Tainan were correlated with the occurrence of aspergillosis in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Overall (2015C2019), aspergillosis was significantly correlated with influenza (p = 0.002), influenza A (H1N1) (p < 0.001), and PM(2.5) (p = 0.040) in Tainan City. Using a stepwise regression model, influenza A (H1N1) (p < 0.0001) and Tainan PM(10) (p = 0.016) could significantly predict the occurrence of aspergillosis in Tainan. PM-related bioaerosols and influenza A (H1N1) contribute to the incidence of pulmonary aspergillosis.","output":"Epidemiological Correlation of Pulmonary Aspergillus Infections with Ambient Pollutions and Influenza A (H1N1) in Southern Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on endocrine surgical volumes.

This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers, before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men; PR=1.38(1.17-1.62), 65 years old+; PR=2.45(1.92-3.12)) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men; PR=0.85(0.78-0.93), 65 years old+; PR=0.38(0.29-0.49)). Additionally, respondents working from home or living alone had significantly higher PR for increased smoking (working from home; PR=1.29(1.17-1.41), living alone; PR=1.23(1.10-1.38)) and respondents who changed from cigarettes to heated tobacco products (HTPs) had significantly lower PR for quitting smoking (PR=0.15(0.04-0.58)). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.","output":"Changes in smoking behavior since the declaration of the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan : A cross sectional study from the Osaka health app"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine (TM)the management of disease at a distancehas potential usefulness for patients with advanced respiratory disease. Underscoring this potential is the dramatic expansion of its applications in clinical medicine. However, since clinical studies testing this intervention often provide heterogeneous results, its role in the medical management of respiratory disorders remains inconclusive. A major problem in establishing TMs effectiveness is that it is not a single intervention; rather, it includes a number of divergent diagnostic and therapeutic modalitiesand each must be tested separately. Reflecting the discord between the need for further documentation of its approaches and effectiveness and its rapid utilization without this needed information, a major challenge is the lack of international guidelines for its integration, regulation, operational plans, and guidance for professionals. Tailored TM, with increased flexibility to address differing healthcare contexts, has the potential to improve access to and quality of services while reducing costs and direct input by health professionals. We should view TM as a tool to aid healthcare professionals in managing their patients with respiratory diseases rather than as a stand-alone substitute to traditional medical care.

Methods: Of 1576 Coptic clergy participating in the COVID-19-Clergy study, serving in Egypt, USA and Europe, 213 had the infection and were included in this analysis. Based on the presence of systemic arterial hypertension (AH), participants were divided into two groups: Group- I, Clergy with AH (n=77) and Group-II, without AH (n=136).Participants' demographic indices, cardiovascular risk factors, COVID-19 management details and related mortality were assessed. Results: Clergy with AH were older (p<0.001), more obese (p=0.04), had frequent type 2 diabetes (DM) (p=0.001), dyslipidemia (p=0.001) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (p=0.04) compared to those without AH. COVID- 19 treatment at home, hospital or in intensive care did not differ between the patient groups (p>0.05 for all). Clergy serving in Northern and Southern Egypt had a higher mortality rate compared to those from Europe and the USA combined (5.22%, 6.38%, 0%;p=0.001). The impact of AH on mortality was significant only in Southern Egypt (10% vs. 3.7%;p=0.01) but not in Northern Egypt (4.88% vs. 5.81%;p=0.43).

Several screening tests for dysphagia have been developed and are used in clinical practice to prevent dysphagia complications. The Gugging Swallowing Screen is 1 such screening test. It is suggested for use in the assessment of the ability of patients to swallow fluid and non-fluid foods separately. It also promotes effective communication between healthcare providers. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the validity and benefit of the Gugging Swallowing Screen. DESIGN: This was a systematic review. DATA SOURCE: We sourced data from electronic databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, KoreaMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean studies Information Service System. REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases. We included studies published in English and Korean up to November 2018 that pertained to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. We designed strategies that included Medical Subject Headings and keywords, such as \\"dysphagia,\\" \\"swallowing,\\" \\"assessment,\\" \\"screening,\\" and \\"GUSS,\\" used alone or in combination. RESULTS: Of the 297 studies that appeared in the search result, 219 articles were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers after duplicate studies were eliminated. Finally, 8 articles were included in this study. With regard to validity, the Gugging Swallowing Screen had a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99), a pooled specificity of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.74), and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9381. With regard to benefit, early systematic dysphagia screening using Gugging Swallowing Screen performed by nurses reduced both screening time and pneumonia rate compared to the control group (p = 0.004). The incidence of X-ray-verified pneumonia was significantly lower in the Gugging Swallowing Screen group than in the clinical screening group (p  0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of pneumonia compared to the value predicted using the 10 mL water swallowing test. CONCLUSIONS: The Gugging Swallowing Screen is a reliable and sensitive tool for screening dysphagia. Early and systematic assessment can prevent aspiration and pneumonia. However, further studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this tool.","output":"The Gugging Swallowing Screen in dysphagia screening for patients with stroke: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Over 23 million Americans are afflicted with severe obesity, i.e. their body mass index (in kilograms per square meter) values exceed 35. Of even greater concern is the association of the adiposity with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiopulmonary failure, asthma, pseudotumor cerebri, infertility, and crippling arthritis. OBJECTIVE Diets, exercise, behavioral modification, and drugs are not effective in these individuals. This article examines the effect of surgery on the control of the weight and the comorbidities, as well as the safety of these operations. INTERVENTIONS Although the article focuses on the outcomes of the three most commonly performed operations, i.e. adjustable gastric banding, the gastric bypass, and the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch, it aims for perspective with the inclusion of abandoned and current investigational procedures, a review of the complications, and an emphasis on the appropriate selection of patients. POSITIONS: Ample evidence, including controlled randomized studies, now document that bariatric surgery produces durable weight loss exceeding 100 lb (46 kg), full and long-term remission of type 2 diabetes in over 80% with salutary effects on the other comorbidities as well with significant reductions in all-cause mortality. Although the severely obese present with serious surgical risks, bariatric surgery is performed safely with a 0.35% 90-d mortality in Centers of Excellence throughout the United States-similar to the complication rates after cholecystectomy.

Self-reported face mask wearing status and related perceptions were assessed. Compared with the Europeans, Chinese participants showed a stronger pro-masking tendency. Subjective norm was an important predictor of face mask wearing in public. Wearing of face masks in the Chinese sample was also associated with risk perception as well as obedience to advice from local health authority.

We found that Tfr cells were significantly enriched in peripheral blood and in mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the onset of ARDS. Notably, Tfr cells represented the majority of Treg cells in the mini-BAL samples. Tfr cells also showed CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF- expression, but compared to the non-Tfr Treg cells, the CTLA-4 and IL-10 expression by Tfr cells were slightly reduced. Both Tfr cells and non-Tfr Treg cells suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4(+)CD25(?) T cells; however, the Tfr cells displayed slightly reduced suppression capacity. Subsequently, B cells were co-incubated with autologous Tfr cells or non-Tfr Treg cells. Interestingly, we found that the frequency of IL-10(+) Breg cells was significantly higher following incubation with Tfr cells than with non-Tfr Treg cells, which suggested that Tfr cells were more potent at inducing IL-10(+) Breg cells. Together, these results demonstrated that Tfr cells were a similar but distinctive subset of Treg cells. Given that Tfr cells were strongly enriched in ARDS patients, especially in the lung infiltrates, they may exert critical ameliorating effects in ARDS.","output":"T follicular regulatory cells infiltrate the human airways during the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and regulate the development of B regulatory cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore digestive system manifestations in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

However, the therapeutic application has been simplistically limited to using antioxidants with little correction of diseases, and many biomarkers of OS, although confirming and quantifying the magnitude of this pathology, are not suggestive of the underlying causes behind generation of a large amount of free radicals. Unfortunately, research has not noted the multi-implication parallel phenomenon of Ihtiraq (Combustion) in Unani Medicine, which possesses much richer etiopathological sub-typing and much more variegated selective and specific treatments (and prophylactics) corresponding to each sub-type of Ihtiraq; the identification of each sub-type's molecular counterparts can be used to develop not only sub-types of OS pathologies and corresponding selective treatments/prophylactics but also non-biomolecular factors. Eminent Unani physicians described a deteriorative phenomenon, which they termed as 'Ihtiraq' which stands for extreme metabolism or 'combustion' and is recognized as a fundamental pathology, contributing as a major factor to the development of chronic diseases. Further, Unani Medicine also possesses a pathophysiological phenomenon called 'Hararat Ghariba' (Unnatural Heat) whose diverse associations with Ihtiraq may be correlatable as upstream, parallel, or downstream associations of OS and consequent pathologies. AIM OF THE STUDY The aim of the study is to: MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is presented with a noteworthy insight into Unani concepts and a thorough study of classical Unani literature by Ibn Sina (10th century), Zakaria Razi (9th century), Ibn Rushd (12th century), Ibn al-Nafees (13th century), Majusi (10th century), and Jurjani (11th century), and comparative detailed study of modern concepts of OS from literature databases, as well as Google, recent researches, and review articles. RESULT The study showed very close correspondences between the phenomenon, etiopathology, and treatment and prevention of Ihtiraq in Unani Medicine and OS in contemporary biomolecular medicine. It also revealed sub-types of Ihtiraq and corresponding selective Unani treatments and prophylactics including drugs and non-drug factors. CONCLUSION After a comprehensive study and analysis of the most recent researches and classical theories, it can be stated that OS can be seen as a molecular level expression of Ihtiraq. Further, various components of Ihtiraq may be used to hypothesize molecular sub-types of OS and propose corresponding specific interventions.","output":"Conceptof 'Ihtiraq' in Unani Medicine - A correlation with oxidative stress, and future prospects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Focal malformations of cortical development including focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly and megalencephaly, are a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with brain overgrowth, cellular and architectural dysplasia, intractable epilepsy, autism and intellectual disability. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia is the most common cause of focal intractable paediatric epilepsy. Gain and loss of function variants in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway have been identified in this spectrum, with variable levels of mosaicism and tissue distribution. In this study, we performed deep molecular profiling of common PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway variants in surgically resected tissues using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), combined with analysis of key phenotype data. A total of 159 samples, including 124 brain tissue samples, were collected from 58 children with focal malformations of cortical development. We designed an ultra-sensitive and highly targeted molecular diagnostic panel using ddPCR for six mutational hotspots in three PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway genes, namely PIK3CA (p.E542K, p.E545K, p.H1047R), AKT3 (p.E17K) and MTOR (p.S2215F, p.S2215Y). We quantified the level of mosaicism across all samples and correlated genotypes with key clinical, neuroimaging and histopathological data. Pathogenic variants were identified in 17 individuals, with an overall molecular solve rate of 29.31%. Variant allele fractions ranged from 0.14 to 22.67% across all mutation-positive samples. Our data show that pathogenic MTOR variants are mostly associated with focal cortical dysplasia, whereas pathogenic PIK3CA variants are more frequent in hemimegalencephaly. Further, the presence of one of these hotspot mutations correlated with earlier onset of epilepsy. However, levels of mosaicism did not correlate with the severity of the cortical malformation by neuroimaging or histopathology. Importantly, we could not identify these mutational hotspots in other types of surgically resected epileptic lesions (e.g. polymicrogyria or mesial temporal sclerosis) suggesting that PI3K-AKT-MTOR mutations are specifically causal in the focal cortical dysplasia-hemimegalencephaly spectrum. Finally, our data suggest that ultra-sensitive molecular profiling of the most common PI3K-AKT-MTOR mutations by targeted sequencing droplet digital polymerase chain reaction is an effective molecular approach for these disorders with a good diagnostic yield when paired with neuroimaging and histopathology.","output":"Profiling PI3K-AKT-MTOR variants in focal brain malformations reveals new insights for diagnostic care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary studies showed that dietary-related problem such as obesity is associated with other chronic diseases like hypertension, irregular blood sugar levels, and increased risk of heart attacks.

Currently, there are nine FDA-approved drugs for HCC, five monoclonal antibodies and four tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) has been validated as a target in preclinical studies, which demonstrates that it is a potential target to treat HCC. Currently, there are no OAT inactivators in clinical trials for HCC. This Innovation describes evidence to support inhibition of OAT as a novel approach for HCC tumor growth inhibition. After the mechanism of OAT is discussed, the origins of our involvement in OAT inactivation, based on our previous work on mechanism-based inactivation of GABA-AT, are described. Once it was demonstrated that OAT inactivation does lead to HCC tumor growth inhibition, new selective OAT inactivators were designed and their inactivation mechanisms were elucidated. A summary of these mechanistic studies is presented. Inactivators of OAT provide the potential for treatment of HCC, targeting the Wnt/?-catenin pathway.","output":"Inactivators of Ornithine Aminotransferase for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rocha do Oeste pear is a Portuguese Protected Designation of Origin variety and one of the country's most relevant fruits for its nutritional value, production area, and exportation amounts. The recent integration of a pilot-scale juice production line brought to SUMOL+COMPAL company the need to characterize the new resulting fractions and value the new by-products. The objective of this work was to value the juice clarification by-products, producing a clean label and fiber-rich snack, in a circular economy rationale, where the secondary products are upcycled back into the food value chain, by creating another food product that includes those by-products. For the above to be possible, the laboratory conditions to produce pear fractions were optimized. After optimizing the puree centrifugation, using response surface methodology (RSM), and optimizing the turbid juice crossflow filtration, the different fractions were characterized in rheological, nutritional, and physical aspects. Comparison to the pulps revealed an increase in the viscosity of the pomace; an enriching effect on the fructose, glucose, and dietary fiber levels in the pomace, and maintenance of the vitamin C levels after centrifugation; and with no effect on the contents of total phenols during the filtration step. A thick pear snack was developed, incorporating retained fraction, inulin, and Euglena gracilis in the pomace, and optimized regarding its firmness and dietary fiber content. The snack characterization revealed an interesting total phenols content (which was maintained from the raw materials). Compared to the snack without microalgae and a commercial fruit snack, the pear snack with E. gracilis was well-accepted by the sensory panel, mainly in texture and appearance, and can be further improved in aroma and flavor. The snack without microalgae was the favorite among the three samples, in most sensory parameters, and never got the answer I'm sure I wouldn't buy it. Therefore, an innovative, clean label and plant-based snack was developed, in a circular economy rationale, which was relatively well-appreciated by the panel. This snack is rich in dietary fiber, having the possibility of presenting various nutritional claims, and the potential for easy sensory optimization.","output":"Clean Label Rocha Pear (Pyrus communis L.)

Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6, as expected2,3. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection still led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and pulmonary pathology, but with a trend towards higher viral loads in nasal turbinates and lower viral loads in lung parenchyma compared with WA1/2020 infection. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in more robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Reduced Pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ponzi schemes that offer absurdly high rates of return by relying on more and more people paying into the scheme have been documented since at least the mid-1800s.

The aim of this study was to determine the capability of an inanimate laparoscopic appendectomy model to discriminate between different levels of surgical experience (construct validity). METHODS The performance of 3 groups with different levels of expertise in laparoscopic surgery--experts (Group A), intermediates (Group B), and novices (Group C)--was evaluated. The groups were instructed of the task to perform in the model using a video tutorial. Procedures were recorded in a digital format for later analysis using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score; procedure time was registered. The data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test. RESULTS Twelve subjects were evaluated, 4 in each group, using the GOALS score and time required to finish the task. Higher scores were observed in the expert group, followed by the intermediate and novice groups, with statistically significant difference. Regarding procedure time, a significant difference was also found between the groups, with the experts having the shorter time. The proposed model is able to discriminate among individuals with different levels of expertise, indicating that the abilities that the model evaluates are relevant in the surgeon's performance.

In cystic fibrosis, where airway mucus is dehydrated, it has been shown that inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) produces both acute and sustained enhancement of mucociliary clearance (MCC). The current study was designed to assess the acute and sustained effect of inhaled 7% HS on MCC in adult asthma. METHODS: Well-controlled, moderateCsevere female asthmatic patients (n=8) were screened with a single test dose of albuterol (four puffs by metered-dose inhaler) followed by HS (7% sodium chloride, 4 mL using PARI LC Star nebuliser). Spirometry was measured pre-treatment and 5 and 30 min post-treatment for safety. MCC was measured using -scintigraphy on three separate visits: at baseline, during inhalation and 4 h after a single dose of HS. RESULTS: MCC was acutely enhanced during HS treatment; meansd clearance over 60 min of dynamic imaging (Ave60Clr) was 8.97.9% (baseline) versus 23.47.6% (acute HS) (p<0.005). However, this enhancement was not maintained over a 4-h period where post-HS treatment Ave60Clr was 9.38.2%. In this small cohort we found no decrements in lung function up to 30 min post-treatment (forced expiratory volume in 1 s 97.410.0% predicted pre-treatment and 98.910.7% predicted 30 min post-treatment). CONCLUSION: While MCC was rapidly enhanced during 7% HS treatment there was no effect on MCC at 4 h post-treatment.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows that neurotropism is a common feature of Coronaviruses (CoVs). Like the other CoVs, SARS-CoV 2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The brain is thought to express ACE2 receptors detected on glial cells and neurons. There are also ACE2 receptors in skeletal muscles. Our study aimed to investigate neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and contribute to this area of limited knowledge. METHODS: A total of 51 patients, presented to hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were included in the study. The diagnosis of all patients included in the study was made according to the WHO interim guideline. The patients were divided into two subgroups as mild and severe course according to the severity of the disease. RESULTS: Neurological symptoms were detected in 16 (31.37 %) patients. Muscle injury was detected in 10 (19.61 %) patients. The most common neurological symptom was headache (n: 9, 17.65 %). When the frequency of all neurological symptoms was compared in those with severe and mild disease, no significant differences were found between the groups. When the frequency of muscular involvement was compared in patients with severe and mild course, no significant differences were found between the groups.

Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of Ace2 in intestinal models of inflammation.

We report five patients who were evaluated for fever and discharged from our PED and were subsequently diagnosed with MIS-C (n = 3) or Kawasaki Disease (n = 2) during their RV within 7 days. All patients presented with fever during the initial visit and three of the five children had gastrointestinal symptoms. They were all noted have persistent tachycardia during the index visit. Three patients presented in cardiogenic shock and echocardiographic abnormalities were noted in four patients during the RV. Significant interventions were required in majority of these children (PICU admission: 4, inotropes: 3, mechanical ventilation:2). Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for diagnosis of MIS-C especially in those who present with persistent fever and have abnormal vital signs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"MIS-C among return visits for fever in a pediatric emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Reducing exposure to cigarette smoke is an imperative for public health and for patients with diabetes. Increasingly, combustion-free nicotine delivery systems (C-F NDS) such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products are substituting conventional cigarettes and accelerating the downward trends in smoking prevalence. However, there is limited information about the long-term health impact in patients with diabetes who use C-F NDS. This randomised trial of type 2 diabetic cigarette smokers will test the hypothesis that following a switch from conventional cigarettes to C-F NDS a measurable improvement in metabolic syndrome (MetS) factors will be shown over the course of 2 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is multicentre and thus will take place in five locations in four countries in an ambulatory setting. A total of 576 patients with diabetes will be randomised (1:2 ratio) to either a control arm (Study Arm A), in which they will be offered referral to smoking cessation programmes or to an intervention arm (Study Arm B) assigned to C-F NDS use. Participants will be at least 23 years old and of any gender. Patient recruitment will start in February 2021 and is expected to be completed by December 2021. Primary outcome measures include fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and waist circumference, while secondary feature absolute change in the sum of the individual factors of MetS and change in each individual factor of MetS measured at each study time point. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of research ethics committee (REC) regarding the trial protocol, informed consent forms and other relevant documents is required to commence the study. Substantial amendments to the study protocol cannot be implemented until the REC grants a favourable opinion. The results of the study are intended to be published as articles in high quality peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through conference papers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04231838.

METHODS: Monthly FDG PET-CT scanning activity was collected from 41/48 NHS England provider sites. Data from 31/41 sites were stratified by nononcology/oncology, cancer type, with lung cancer and lymphoma split into specific indications, turn-around times and delays due to radiotracer. RESULTS: In April and May 2020, a 32 and 31% decrease in activity was observed, a larger decrease for noncancer compared with cancer FDG PET-CT. In June 2020, activity started to recover with 6% fewer scans recorded compared with June 2019. Of the six most common indications, lung and oesophageal cancer had the largest decrease in activity and slowest recovery. Lymphoma and melanoma showed the smallest decrease and fastest recovery. Lung cancer scans for initial diagnosis/staging saw the largest fall and slowest recovery compared with scans for known lung cancer. There was no percentage increase in overall turn-around time compared with the same months in 2019, and no increase in turn-around time of more than 7 working days due to FDG supply during April and May 2020 compared with the 3 previous months. CONCLUSIONS: There is no correlation between FDG PET-CT activity (fall and recovery) in England and the ability to provide the service by NHS England. It most likely reflects a combination of changes in health-seeking behaviour, NHS health policy and a decrease in the use of investigations that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: impact on NHS England PET-CT services and lessons learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsant used in several clinical scenarios. VPA has been increasingly associated with intentional or unintentional overdose. In patients presenting with severe VPA overdose, supportive care and airway protection are cornerstones of treatment, while levocarnitine is suggested in patients with hyperammonemia and hemodialysis is recommended in patients with VPA serum concentrations (SC) >1,300 mg/L and presence of cerebral edema or shock. Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity. The pharmacological interaction between VPA and meropenem is characterized by a rapid decrease in VPA concentrations, which contraindicates concurrent use. Case presentation The following case report describes the use of meropenem to enhance the clearance of VPA in the case of severe VPA overdose. A patient with altered mental status was transported to the emergency department (ED) after VPA overdose. Meropenem was prescribed for significant elevated VPA SC. An important decline in SC was observed with short-term meropenem dosing, and an improvement in mental status occurred shortly after administration. Conclusions Carbapenem therapy has the potential to be used as last line strategy in the management of severe VPA overdose in patients where SC represent a significant risk of toxicity and clinical symptoms suggest difficulty managing the patient.","output":"Meropenem for management of valproic acid overdose: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To report the 6-year incidence, causes and risk factors for vision loss (visual impairment (VI) and blindness), among elderly adults in rural southern China. METHODS Population-based, cohort study. Initiated in 2014, the study recruited participants aged 50 and older using random cluster sampling from Yangxi County. All eligible participants were invited to attend interviews and comprehensive eye examinations at the 6-year follow-up between November 2020 and March 2021. The WHO categories of vision loss were used to define incident cases of VI (3/60VA <6/12), moderate-to-severe VI (MSVI) (3/60VA<6/18) and blindness (VA <3/60) in the better-seeing eye. RESULTS Among the 5825 baseline participants, 3187 (64.4%) of 4946 surviving subjects participated in the 6-year follow-up. Based on presenting and best-corrected VA, respectively, the crude incidence rate of blindness was 0.8% (95% CI 0.5% to 1.1%) vs 0.3% (95% CI 0.1% to 0.5%), for MSVI 6.7% (95% CI 5.7% to 7.6%) vs 4.6% (95% CI 3.8% to 5.4%) and for any VI 16.1% (95% CI 14.5% to 17.6%) vs 12.9% (95% CI 11.6% to 14.1%). Cataract (48.3%) and refractive errors (44.4%) were the most common causes of vision loss. Factors significantly associated with greater incident vision loss were older age, female sex, less education, living alone and longer axial length (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Substantial work is still required to reduce avoidable vision loss in rural China. Screening outreach and efforts to improve awareness which target the poorer and less educated are urgently needed to reduce the growing unmet need for eye care due to ageing.","output":"Incidence, causes and risk factors of vision loss in rural Southern China: 6-year follow-up of the Yangxi Eye Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our ability to implement the necessary responses to adapt to or mitigate climate and ecologic change, endure its consequences, and turn ambitious policy into results will depend on the social and emotional resilience and involvement of people and communities","output":"Leadership for the Social Climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To date, few data on paediatric COVID-19 have been published, and most reports originate from China. This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and health-care service planning during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating health-care institutions across 25 European countries, using a well established research network-the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet)-that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between April 1 and April 24, 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis, and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission. FINDINGS: 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 50 years (IQR 05-120) and a sex ratio of 115 males per female. 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital. 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration 7 days, IQR 2-11, range 1-34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and one (<1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio 506, 95% CI 172-1487; p=00035), male sex (212, 106-421; p=0033), pre-existing medical conditions (327, 167-642; p=00015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (1046, 516-2123; p<00001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir-ritonavir (six [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (three [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (seven [1%] patients), tocilizumab (four [1%] patients), anakinra (three [1%] patients), and siltuximab (one [<1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate 069%, 95% CI 020-182); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities' prescription, its former benchmarks.

Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.","output":"How to deal with COVID-19 epidemic-related lockdown physical inactivity and sedentary increase in youth?

Our study objective was to understand changes in emergency department (ED) utilization following a nonfatal opioid overdose during COVID-19 compared to historical controls in 6 healthcare systems across the United States. METHODS: Opioid overdoses were retrospectively identified among adult visits to 25 EDs in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island from January 2018 to December 2020. Overdose visit counts and rates per 100 all-cause ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with the levels predicted based on 2018 and 2019 visits using graphical analysis and an epidemiologic outbreak detection cumulative sum algorithm. RESULTS: Overdose visit counts increased by 10.5% (n=3486; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.18% to 17.0%) in 2020 compared with the counts in 2018 and 2019 (n=3020 and n=3285, respectively), despite a 14% decline in all-cause ED visits. Opioid overdose rates increased by 28.5% (95% CI 23.3% to 34.0%) from 0.25 per 100 ED visits in 2018 to 2019 to 0.32 per 100 ED visits in 2020. Although all 6 studied health care systems experienced overdose ED visit rates more than the 95th percentile prediction in 6 or more weeks of 2020 (compared with 2.6 weeks as expected by chance), 2 health care systems experienced sustained outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Despite decreases in ED visits for other medical emergencies, the numbers and rates of opioid overdose-related ED visits in 6 health care systems increased during 2020, suggesting a widespread increase in opioid-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanded community- and hospital-based interventions are needed to support people with opioid use disorder and save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Emergency Department Visits for Nonfatal Opioid Overdose During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across Six US Health Care Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a significant impact on patients with end-stage kidney disease and their care, especially given the potential for severe coronavirus disease 2019 in those with a depressed immune status.

The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression during lockdown among undergraduates from Ecuador, and to test these possible predictors of depression using a model taken from our study of the scientific literature. A total of 640 undergraduates (72% women) between 18 and 47 years old (M = 21.69; S.D = 4.093) were surveyed. The resulting mean levels found for stress, anxiety, and depression were above levels considered non-pathological. Women showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than men. The statistical prediction for depression showed a good fit. This depression could be related: both directly and positively by fear of COVID-19 and stress, and indirectly, as a result of these two factors, positively mediated by anxiety. Our study concludes by highlighting the important role that the complex relationships between fear, stress, and anxiety can play in the development of depression symptoms and how they can be taken into account in programs aimed at preventing and alleviating this disorder.

However, oral care is often overlooked and not prioritized in daily activity plan of nurses even when oral problems are apparent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess nurses attitude towards oral care and their practicing level for hospitalized patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted in adult medical-surgical department of Orotta hospital from December 2017 to January 2018. Data was collected from all (N = 73) diploma and associate nurses through face to face interview using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U tests and spearman rank correlation coefficient tools were performed to analyze the data using SPSS (Version 22). RESULTS: Out of the 79 participants, 73 completed the interview successfully with a response rate of 92.4%. Of the total, 56.2% were diploma nurses and 43.9% were associate nurses. The median attitude score was 68.89/100 (IQR = 48.89). The majority (94.5%) of the nurses agreed that oral cavity assessment is nurses responsibility and 94.5% reported adequate training is needed to provide quality oral care. On the other hand, the median practice score was 50.00/100 (IQR = 17.86). Majority of the participants (76.7%) did not perform routine oral health assessment. Almost all (98.4%) used gauze and normal saline for oral care. Practice score was significantly different across the various wards (p < 0.001), however, it was not significantly correlated with attitude (p = 0.646). CONCLUSIONS: The participants had poor level of oral care practice to hospitalized patients, nevertheless, they had favourable attitude. Therefore, Orotta National Referral Hospital needs to give further effort to train the nursing staff, ensure the availability of adequate oral care equipment and provide clear guidelines regarding oral care of hospitalized patients.","output":"Nurses attitude towards oral care and their practicing level for hospitalized patients in Orotta National Referral Hospital, Asmara-Eritrea: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in targeting the prostate gland, leading to exacerbation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms and greater risks of BPH complications such as acute urinary retention. METHODS: A categorized and comprehensive search in the literature has been conducted by 10 April 2021 using international databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library in line with the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. PICO strategy was used to formulate the research question. The following terms were used: urology, COVID-19, coronavirus, BPH, inflammation, androgen receptors, LUTS, IPSS, PSA, and SARS-CoV-2 or a combination of them. Studies with irrelevant purposes and duplicates were excluded. The selected studies were performed on humans and published in English. RESULTS: The research revealed 89 articles. After title screening and considering exclusion criteria, 52 papers were included for the systematic review. BPH is a common condition affecting older men. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cell by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A hyperactivated RAS system during infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and increased cytokine release. Thus, this virus can lead to exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and trigger inflammatory processes in the prostate gland. Since androgen receptors (AR) play an important role in the BPH pathophysiology and infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be androgen-mediated, BPH progression and its related symptoms can be a complication of COVID-19 through AR involvement and metabolic disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current findings, SARS-CoV-2 can possibly damage the prostate and worsen BPH and its related LUTS through ACE2 signaling, AR-related mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic derangement. We encourage future studies to investigate the possible role of COVID-19 in the progression of BPH-related LUTS and examine the prostatic status in susceptible patients with relevant available questionnaires (e.g., IPSS) and serum biomarkers (e.g., PSA).","output":"Is COVID-19 a risk factor for progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and exacerbation of its related symptoms?: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout (defined as a state of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of reduced achievement) is a risk to all health care workers.

Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1124 HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 30, 2020, to April 2, 2020). Demographic data, questions on COVID-19 and scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were analysed using the chi-square test (Bonferroni correction) and binary logistic regression. Results: The study consists of 1124 HCWs, including 749 doctors, 207 nurses, 135 paramedics, 23 administrators and ten supporting staff members. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were reported as 37.2% and 31.4%, respectively. The risk factors for anxiety were female gender (30.6% vs 45.5%), age group (20-35 years) (50.4% vs 61.2%), unmarried (21.2% vs 30.6%) and job profile (nurse) (14.7% vs 26.4%). The protective factor was having service of more than 20 years (23.4% vs 14.8%). The risk factors for depression were age group (20-35 years) (51.3% vs 61.3%) and employed at a primary care hospital (16.2% vs 23.4%). The protective factors were job profile (doctor) (69.9% vs 59.6%) and having service of more than 20 years (22.3% vs 15.5%). Conclusion: Approximately one-third of the HCWs reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. The risk factors for anxiety symptoms were female gender, younger age and job profile (nurse) and for depressive symptoms were younger age and working at a primary care hospital. Future research studies should identify strategies for providing a safer and supportive work environment for HCWs to face epidemics/pandemics.","output":"Survey of prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among 1124 healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic across India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of a vaccine requires a very high level of expertise.

These special dosage forms can result in increased bioavailability of drugs. Low-density floating formulations can also increase the gastric residence time of drugs; therefore, drug release will be sustained. Our aim was to produce a stable floating formula by foaming. Matrix components, PEG 4000 and stearic acid type 50, were selected with the criteria of low gastric irritation, a melting range below 70 C, and well-known use in oral drug formulations. This matrix was melted at 54 C in order to produce a dispersion of active substance and was foamed by different gases at atmospheric pressure using an ultrasonic homogenizer. The density of the molded solid foam was studied by the pycnometer method, and its structure was investigated by SEM and micro-CT. The prolonged drug release and mucoadhesive properties were proved in a pH 1.2 buffer.

MEASUREMENTS Frequency and median of parameters and vital status, from diagnosis to the end of the follow-up. RESULTS Main clinical features were skin lesions (83.5%), non-infectious fever (63.6%), weight loss (62%), lung involvement (49.6%), ocular symptoms (38.8%), relapsing chondritis (36.4%), venous thrombosis (34.7%), lymph nodes (33.9%), and arthralgia (27.3%). Hematological disease was present in 58 cases (50%), considered as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n= 58) and monoclonal gammapathy of unknown significance (n=12).UBA1 mutations included p.M41T (44.8%), p.M41V (30.2%), p.M41L (18.1%), and splice mutations (6.9%). After a median follow-up of 3.0 years, 18 patients died (15.5%), from infectious origin (n=9) and MDS progression (n=3). Unsupervised analysis identified 3 clusters: cluster 1 (47%) with mild-to-moderate disease; cluster 2 (16%) with underlying MDS and higher mortality rates; cluster 3 (37%) with constitutional manifestations, higher C-reactive protein levels and less frequent chondritis. Five-year probability of survival was 84.2% in cluster 1, 50.5 % in cluster 2, and 89.6% in cluster 3. UBA1 p.Met41Leu mutation was associated with a better prognosis.

There is a pressing need for institutions to present discipline-specific strategies for the management of COVID-19 patients. We present the comprehensive considerations at the National University Hospital, Singapore from the surgeon's and anesthetist's perspectives in the performance of spinal surgery in COVID-19 patients. These are based on national guidelines and overarching principles of protection for the healthcare workers (HCWs) and efficiency in surgical planning. The workflow begins with the emergency department screening that has been adapted to the local epidemiology of COVID-19 in order to identify suspected/confirmed cases. If patient history cannot be obtained, demographic, clinical, and imaging data are used. Designated orthopedic \\"contaminated teams\\" are available 24/7 with an activation time of <30 minutes for review. In cases where sub-specialty spine surgeons were required, these professionals were inducted into the \\"contaminated team\\" and quarantined until cleared to return to work. Indications for emergency spine surgery were determined pre-emptively. Preoperative surgical considerations included the minimization of manpower, limited dissection, reduced operative time, and judicious use of equipment, leading to reduced aerosolization. Anesthesia considerations include preoperative screening for COVID-19-related concerns that influence surgery, operating room process planning and induction, intraoperative, reversal, recovery, and resuscitation considerations. Focused multi-disciplinary preoperative briefing facilitates familiarization. Surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative workflows were designed to reduce the risk of transmission and protect HCWs while effectively performing spinal surgery. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated paradigm shifts in healthcare planning, hospital workflows, and operative protocols.

Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during fMRI scanning. We first report evidence for an upright facial organisation in all three groups, with the upper face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of all tested facial parts in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their PLP. In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across all facial parts, where the location of the cortical neighbour C the forehead C is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.","output":"Reassessing face topography in primary somatosensory cortex and remapping following hand loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of 444 vaccinated hospital employees in Japan were measured 94C109 days and 199C212 days after receiving the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose to evaluate the intensity and duration of antibody response in our own cohort.

The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of VTE in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its correlation with D-dimer levels and pharmacological prophylaxis. Methods This was a cohort study of critically ill patients due to COVID-19. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit on the same day of April 2020 were selected, regardless of length of stay, and a single bilateral venous duplex ultrasound in the lower extremities was performed up to 72 hours later. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed with computed tomography angiography. Asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE were registered, including pre-screening in hospital VTE. Characteristics of patients, blood test results, doses of thromboprophylaxis received, VTE events, and mortality after seven day follow up were recorded. Results A total of 230 critically ill patients were studied. Median intensive care unit stay of these patients was 12 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5 C 19 days). After seven days of follow up, the frequency of patients with VTE, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was 26.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21% C 32%) (69 events in 61 patients): 45 with DVT and 16 with PE (eight of them with concomitant DVT). Cumulative frequency of symptomatic VTE was 8.3% (95% CI 4.7% C 11.8%). D-dimer values  1 500 ng/mL were diagnostic for VTE, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 42%. During follow up after screening, six patients developed new VTE. Three of them developed a recurrence after a DVT diagnosed at screening, despite receiving therapeutic doses of heparin. Mortality rates at seven day follow up were the same for those with (6.6%) and without (5.3%) VTE. Conclusion Patients with severe COVID-19 infection are at high risk for VTE, and further new symptomatic VTE events and recurrence can occur despite anticoagulation.

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20C83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.

Our findings suggest that patients recently treated for a B-lymphoid malignancy are at uniquely high risk for severe COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that recent therapy for a B-lymphoid malignancy is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity. These findings provide rationale to develop mitigation strategies targeted at the uniquely high-risk population of patients with recently treated B-lymphoid malignancies.

However, few programs and policies focus on improving adolescent nutrition in Indonesia. To address this gap, we implemented a gender-responsive package of interventions: (1) breakfast and weekly iron-folic acid supplementation (WIFS), (2) a school-based nutrition education program, and (3) a social behavior change communication strategy. We surveyed 514 adolescents at baseline (2019) and endline (2020) in Klaten and Lombok Barat districts in Indonesia. The survey included a knowledge assessment on nutrition, as well as indicators of attitudes and behaviors on diet, physical activity, and WIFS. We employed multivariable linear and logistic regression to test for preCpost intervention differences. Overall knowledge was significantly higher post-intervention ([Formula: see text]: 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 3.9). Diet diversity was high at both timepoints, however, at post-intervention there was significantly higher odds of consuming vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) and lower odds of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.5). Post-intervention, there was higher odds of reporting 60 min of daily physical activity (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.7, 3.2) and WIFS among girls (OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 1.5, 30.9).

For various reasons, many patients chose to remain at home and delay any interaction at medical facilities to protect themselves or others from the virus. Patients managing chronic diseases faced unprecedented challenges during this period and the long-term effects on these patient populations remain unclear. Oncology patients, specifically those diagnosed with head and neck cancers, require prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment for better outcomes. While the overall impact of how the pandemic has affected oncology patients is unknown, this retrospective study examined how the staging of head and neck tumors at our institution has been impacted since the beginning of the pandemic. Materials/Methods Available patient data (from August 2019 through June 2021) was collected from medical records and compared to determine statistical significance. Patients were categorized into a Pre-pandemic group, a Pandemic group, and a Vaccine-approved group based on date of consultation and patient and treatment characteristics were analyzed to look for patterns. The Pre-pandemic period was defined as the period from August 2019 to March 2020, the Pandemic period was defined as the period from March 2020 to December 2020, and the Vaccine approved period was defined as the period from January 2021 to June 2021. Results Fisher's exact tests were used to compare TNM staging distributions between the three groups using the eight edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. In the Pre-pandemic group, out of 67 patients, 33 patients (55.0%) were diagnosed with a T stage of 0-2 and 27 patients (45.0%) were diagnosed with a T stage of 3-4. In the Pandemic and Vaccine approved groups, out of 139 patients, 50 patients (39.1%) were diagnosed with a T stage of 0-2 and 78 patients (60.9%) were diagnosed with a T stage of 3-4; these differences were statistically significant (P-value = 0.0426). The Pre-pandemic group had 25 patients (41.7%) diagnosed with a Group stage of 0-2 and 35 patients (58.3%) diagnosed with a Group stage of 3-4. The Pandemic and Vaccine approved groups had 36 patients (28.1%) diagnosed with a Group stage of 0-2 and 92 patients (71.9%) diagnosed with a Group stage of 3-4; these results trended to statistical significance (P-value = 0.0688). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that there have been a higher number of patients with head and neck cancer diagnosed with a T stage of 3 or 4 at our institution since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing and will need further evaluation to determine the overall effects on oncology patients.

In 2020 the above action plan announced initiatives along the entire life cycle of the product, with the aim to make sustainable products the norm in the EU. Therefore, it is anticipated that the above action will result in an increase in Europe's economic competitiveness, sustainability, resource efficiency and resource security. Within this context, the suitability of ferroalumina as a raw material in the blast furnace is investigated. Ferroalumina is the product of the high-pressure filter press dewatering process of the Greek red mud generated during the production of alumina by means of the Bayer cycle. Ferroalumina is a low-cost raw material and its possible charging in the blast furnace and/or steelmaking aggregates is a step towards industrial symbiosis, where the wastes, namely by-products, of an industry or an industrial process, become the raw materials for another. In the present work the effect of ferroalumina addition as a raw material was examined by smelting ferroalumina, blast furnace-slag, lime and scrap at 1550C in a graphite crucible and a constant slag basicity. The increase of the alumina content in the slag improves the desulfurization capacity. Moreover, the silicon exchange between slag and metal was examined. The results indicate that the alkalis' capacity of the slag increases with the addition of ferroalumina. The analysis of the finally obtained slag suggests that it could be suitable for utilization in slag-cement production.","output":"On the industrial symbiosis of alumina and iron/steel production: Suitability of ferroalumina as raw material in iron and steel making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I draw on Heideggers phenomenology of moods (Stimmungen) to interpret loneliness as a diffused and atmospheric feeling-state that often undergirds the lives of older adults, shaping the ways in which they are attuned to and make sense of the world.

There has been a substantial reduction in neurosurgical operations during the period of lockdown. The lockdown might be the most effective measure to curtail viral transmission. Once we return to the normalization of the lifestyle, there will be a backlog of unoperated pending cases along with the possibility of further spread of the coronavirus. Methods: We reviewed the available literature and protocols for neurosurgical practice in different geographic locations. We drafted a consensus statement based on the literature and protocols suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and various professional societies to prevent the spread of SARS-COV2 while streamlining the neurosurgical practice. Results: The consensus statement suggests the patient triage, workflow, resource distribution, and operational efficacy for care providers at different stages of management. The priority is set at personal protection while ensuring patients' safety, timely management, and capacity building. We performed a detailed subsection analysis for the management of trauma and set up for COVID-free hospitals for simultaneous management of routine neurosurgical indications. In this time of medicolegal upheaval, special consent from the patients should be taken in view of the chances of delay in management and the added risk of corona infection. The consensus statements are applicable to neurosurgical setups of all capacities. Conclusion: Along with the glaring problem of infection, there is another threat of neurosurgery emergency building up. This wave may overwhelm the already stretched systems to the hilt.

This prospective study included 64,040 participants (46.8% men) in the population-based HUNT2 Survey (1995C1997) linked with hospital records in incident BSI. During median follow-up of 15.2 years, 1840 (2.9%) participants (51.3% men) experienced a BSI and 396 (0.6%) died (56.6% men). Men had 41% higher risk of first-time BSI (95% confidence interval (CI), 28C54%) than women. Together, health behaviours, education, cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities mediated 34% of the excess risk of BSI observed in men.

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. Methods: We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Findings: Under scenario A, we estimated 5,196,000 (UI 1,753,000 - 10,220,000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966,000 (UI 467,800 - 1,702,000) hospitalizations and 111,000 (UI 53,400 - 200,000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (i.e. 550,000) and change the epidemic peak from 66,000 on June 9th to 9,400 on March 1st. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (i.e. 74,500), and deaths by 93% (i.e. 7,800).

METHODS Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging lesion volumes were determined with the RAPID software program. HIR was defined as the proportion of TMax >6 s lesion volume with a Tmax >10 s delay and was dichotomized based on its median value (0.4) into low versus high subgroups as well as quartiles. Final infarct volumes were assessed at day 5. Initial infarct growth velocity was calculated as the baseline diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume divided by the delay from symptom onset to baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Total Infarct growth was determined by the difference between final infarct and baseline DWI volumes. Collateral flow was assessed on conventional angiography and dichotomized into good and poor flow. Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 2 at 90 days. RESULTS Ninety-nine patients were included; baseline DWI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and final infarct volumes increased with HIR quartiles (P<0.01). A high HIR predicted poor collaterals with an area under the curve of 0.73. Initial infarct growth velocity and total infarct growth were greater among patients with a high HIR (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, DWI volume, and reperfusion, a low HIR was associated with good functional outcome: odds ratio=4.4 (95% CI, 1.3-14.3); P=0.014.

This study investigates the in vitro and in vivo effects of P2X7R on Th17 cell differentiation during type II collagen (CII) induced experimental arthritis model. In CII-treated dendritic cells (DCs) and DC/CD4(+) T coculture system, pretreatment with pharmacological antagonists of P2X7R (Suramin and A-438079) caused strong inhibition of production of Th17-promoting cytokines (IL-1, TGF-1, IL-23p19 and IL-6). Exposure to CII induced the elevation of mRNAs encoding retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor  and t, which were abolished by pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists. Furthermore, blocking P2X7R signaling abolished the CII-mediated increase in IL-17A. Blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated pathological changes in ankle joint of the collagen-induced arthritis mice.

METHODS: Eligible studies published up to 27 February 2021 were included and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effect size along with its 95% confidence intervals. The quality of body evidence was evaluated using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving a total of 2826 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included in the systematic review. We discovered a moderate-to-high quality of evidence that ICI was not associated with a higher mortality risk, while the other outcomes yielded a very low-to-low-evidence quality. Although our findings indicated that ICI did not result in a higher risk of severity and hospitalization, further evidence is required to confirm our findings. In addition, we discovered that prior exposure to chemoimmunotherapy may be linked with a higher risk of COVID-19 severity (OR 8.19 [95% CI: 2.67C25.08]; I(2) = 0%), albeit with small sample size.

A dearth of role models who can exemplify that it is acceptable to need support compounds barriers to help-seeking once students struggle. We conducted a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of physicians sharing their living experiences with medical students. METHODS: Second-year medical students participated, through synchronized videoconferencing, in an intervention consisting of 3 physicians who shared personal histories of vulnerability (e.g. failure on high-stakes exams; immigration and acculturation stress; and personal psychopathology, including treatment and recovery), followed by facilitated, small-group discussions. For the quantitative component, students completed the Opening Minds to Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) before and after the intervention. For the qualitative component, we conducted focus groups to explore the study intervention. We analyzed anonymized transcripts using thematic analysis aided by NVivo software. RESULTS: We invited all students in the class (n = 61, 46% women) to participate in the research component. Among the 53 participants (87% of the class), OMS-HC scores improved after the intervention (P = .002), driven by the Attitudes (P = .003) and Disclosure (P < .001) subscales.

Researchers have devoted their efforts to in-depth research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bring the epidemic under control as rapidly as possible. Among the many areas of burgeoning SARS-CoV-2 related research, various analytical technologies have been applied to the advancement of virus detection, and development of vaccines and innovative therapies. Separation technologies with the merits of simple operation, high separation efficiency, and high selectivity, have become widely used and are key to progress in life science, medicine, pharmaceutical discovery and development, and other fields. Separation technologies have played an irreplaceable role in the isolation, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this novel coronavirus. In this review, an overview of the relevant literature is presented from ISI Web of Science spanning Jan. 1st, 2020-Dec. 31, 2020, using \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" or \\"COVID-19\\" as keywords. The top 20 research directions are summarized, based on papers published in high impact international journals (e. g. Nature, Science, and Cell). Incorporating the impact of published papers, this review summarizes the primary separation technologies applied in these coronavirus studies, and discusses contributions of the following six technologies: affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography, magnetic bead separation technology, centrifugal technology, micro/nano-separation technology, and electrophoresis. First, affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are discussed, which are the most frequently used protein purification techniques in Nature, Science, and Cell. The SARS-CoV-2 related proteins purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are summarized, and their applications in coronavirus transmission, infection mechanisms, and drug screening are introduced. Subsequently, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is introduced, which is mainly employed for assessing the purity of candidate drugs. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) incorporates the strengths of HPLC and MS, offering both high separation efficiency and structural analysis capabilities with extended applications. LC-MS/MS has been applied to characterization of the binding of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins to potential inhibitors, and to metabolic analyses of candidate drugs. In SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, magnetic bead separation technology plays a crucial role in the separation of novel coronaviruses. In combination with other analytical techniques, magnetic bead separation technology can be applied to cytological analyses and immunological detection by functionalization of bead surfaces. Centrifugal technology is undoubtedly the most basic separation technology. It has been employed in almost all SARS-CoV-2 related researches. By controlling centrifugation speed, centrifugal technology can rapidly isolate virus particles or cultured cells from complex samples. Micro-nano separation technologies, such as microfluidics, offer advantages including small size, low sample consumption, rapid diffusion, and large surface area. In general, microfluidic technologies are often used in combination with other technologies to realize highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins. Finally, the applications of electrophoresis are introduced, which commonly engages in the analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. In novel coronavirus studies, the application of electrophoresis has been relatively limited but has potential with further development to contribute significantly to future research. In conclusion, this review summarizes the contributions of six primary separation technologies to novel coronavirus studies, including epidemic detection and prevention, analyzes the main problems facing coronavirus detection efforts, and discusses the role of separation technologies in addressing these problems, with the aim of providing references for broader application of separation technologies.","output":"[Applications of separation technology in novel coronavirus research, epidemic prevention and detection]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (nBCA) is a fast-acting liquid adhesive that polymerizes when it comes in contact with blood anions.

Given the distal microcatheter position, we opted for nBCA as the liquid embolic of choice for tumor embolization. The time of polymerization for nBCA may be delayed using glacial acetic acid, which makes nBCA ideal when the microcatheter is in a distal position relative to the target location for embolization. The patient underwent successful embolization using nBCA and was taken for a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the meningioma the next day. The intraoperative blood loss was 100 mL and the postoperative MRI showed gross total resection.

An online questionnaire was therefore offered to the visitors of the Croatian Association for Epilepsy's website. The 22-items questionnaire was designed to acquire information from adults with epilepsy living in Croatia on demographic data, cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic, and communication problems between patients and their neurologists during the lockdown. Perceived anxiety and fears were expressed with the Likert scale (1-5) and the results of specific fears added to make the Total Fear Score. Results: Out of 186 respondents in total, only 2.8% did not comply with the lockdown measures, and all of those respondents stated that they did not feel any anxiety related to COVID-19. A canceled neurologist examination during the lockdown was significantly associated with pandemic-related anxiety (2.9a?a?1.28 vs. 2.3a?a?1.19, Ua?=a?3039, pa?=a?0.001) and fears (Total Fear Score 31.4a?a?9.70 vs. 28.4a?a?9.79, Ua?=a?3341, pa?=a?0.036), and 87.4% of respondents expressed the wish to communicate with their neurologist, either by phone/video call (53.0%) or email (34.4%). Conclusion: We think the results of our survey show that the responses from PwE point to a social responsibility appropriate for the existing situation. During future pandemics, telemedicine could have an important role in tackling the fears and anxieties caused by the cancelation of examinations, which corresponds to the wishes expressed by the great majority of our respondents.","output":"Responses of people with epilepsy to the COVID-19 pandemic in the time of national lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 is public health concern across the world. Data on the epidemiology among patients on hemodialysis in Latin America and low and middle-income countries is limited. Methods: Using electronic medical records from the second largest dialysis network in Guatemala, we performed a retrospective analysis of all adult patients on hemodialysis with the diagnosis of COVID-19 to estimate incidence of infection, and describe the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes. We stratified incidence rate by region. We reviewed data from May 1 to July 31, 2020, with outcome data ascertained up to August 28, 2020. Results: Of 3201 patients undergoing hemodialysis, 325 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence rate: 102 per 1,000 patients on hemodialysis, compared with 3 per 1,000 in the general population). Incidence was higher in the Central region (207 per 1,000) and lowest in the Southeast region with 33 per 1,000, and unlike in the general population, incidence was lower in Guatemalan city. Mean age of the COVID-19 diagnosed patients was 51.1 (SD 14.8) years, and 84 (25.8%) were female. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days [IQR 10-16]. 229 (69.8%) of the patients recovered, 90 patients died (27.7%), and 6 (1.8%) patients were still in the hospital at the time of last follow-up. Conclusion: In summary, incidence of diagnosed COVID-19 in Guatemalan patients on hemodialysis was much higher than reported in the general population, with outcomes similar to those described in high income countries.

Major structural biology efforts on these proteins have already provided essential insights into the mode of action of the virus, as well as avenues for structure-based drug design. However, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, or regions thereof, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and as such might exhibit ambiguous, dynamic behaviour that is not evident from static structure representations, nor from molecular dynamics simulations using these structures. We here present a website (http://sars2.bio2byte.be/) that provides protein sequence-based predictions of the backbone and side-chain dynamics and conformational propensities of these proteins, as well as derived early folding, disorder, -sheet aggregation and protein-protein interaction propensities. These predictions attempt to capture the emergent properties of the proteins, so the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in the sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour such as the final folded state. In addition, we provide an indication of the biophysical variation that is observed in homologous proteins, which give an indication of the limits of the functionally relevant biophysical behaviour of these proteins.

Activation of striosome projections, which target \\"dendron bouquets\\" in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound.","output":"Functional Dissection of Basal Ganglia Inhibitory Inputs onto Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estamos vivendo, desde meados de mar?o de 2020, no Brasil, uma situao excepcional, gerada pela pandemia do coronavrus, cientificamente codificada em suas siglas como doen?a, classificada como substantivo feminino, a Covid-19 A prpria definio de pandemia implica uma quest?o mundial, que atinge de alguma maneira a todas e todos: Oriente e Ocidente;Norte e Sul;pobres e ricos;mulheres e homens, cis e trans, homossexuais e heterossexuais;pessoas indgenas, negras, brancas, orientais Entretanto, como Boaventura de Souza Santos (2020) e tantas autoras e autores tm argumentado, essa ideia de uma igualdade frente ao vrus  uma fico, j que a doen?a n?o atinge a todas da mesma forma e com a mesma intensidade Se algumas/ uns de ns podem estar em isolamento nos espa?os domsticos, trabalhando com seus computadores e internet, outras pessoas n?o tm essa possibilidade Segundo este autor, a pandemia e o confinamento como preveno para a mesma promovem e revelam as cis?es perversas das sociedades, que tornam alguns grupos sociais mais suscetveis em raz?o de suas condies socioecon?micas e da falta de polticas pblicas adequadas, visibilizando os que est?o ao sul da quarentena: mulheres, trabalhadoras e trabalhadores precrios ou informais, moradoras e moradores de rua, de periferias pobres e de favelas, as/os internadas/os em campos de refugiados e pris?es, idosas/os, deficientes fsicos (SANTOS, 2020, p 15-21) Esses grupos vulnerveis formam a maioria das pessoas no planeta, aquela maioria que n?o est protegida pela redoma dos planos de sade, das casas com internet rpida, dos empregos em instituies e empresas que permitem home office e continuam pagando salrios, das pessoas que podem comprar alimentos e refeies por delivery","output":"Pandemic in neoliberal necroeconomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. Main results: We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19. Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","output":"Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness currently ravaging the world in pandemic proportions Its route of spread and a high degree of infectivity make it easily transmissible within health care settings Health workers, who are at particular risk of workplace-related infection, should be familiar with and abide by international best practices for infection prevention and control at work to protect themselves and their patients This is particularly important so that they can continue to provide muchneeded care We present a review of international best practices and guidelines to prevent COVID-19 infection in the clinical space in the Nigerian context Our focus is on strategies for administrative control, patient management, and environmental cleaning and waste management","output":"A systemic approach to the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in clinical settings in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a considerable psychological stressor that has a significant impact on every facet of peoples life.

In circumstances such as COVID-19, researchers could deploy previous resources to identify the most prevalent psychological effects of Coronavirus diseases. We aim to systematically review and quantitatively assess the psychological problems during Coronavirus epidemics to identify the most prevalent psychological problems. Method: A systematic review of the literature will be conducted on psychological problems during previous and the new Coronavirus epidemics. Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO/ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar will be systematically searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant articles published from January 1, 2002 to June 20, 2020. Two authors independently identify papers that reported the prevalence rates of the psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. The outcomes will include the most prevalent psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks. To ensure we have gathered all the evidence, we will conduct another search on the specific psychological problems revealed in the previous search. Study selection will follow the Cochrane library guideline. Afterward, data synthesis will be performed via the meta-analysis of the prevalence rates using the random effect model.

Hydroxychloroquine (HQN) is an experimental treatment for COVID-19. Effects of coadministration of HQN with RDV have not been studied and are relevant given the long half-life (~22 days) of HQN. We report the impact of concomitant HQN and RDV use on clinical outcomes and safety in patients with moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation >94% on room air, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV once daily plus standard of care (SoC), or SoC only. We compared patients on concomitant HQN (HQN(pos)) vs not (HQN(neg)). Clinical recovery was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards. Covariate adjustment included age, sex, race, region, symptom duration, oxygen support status and obesity. Recovery and adverse events (AEs) were assessed through death, discharge, or d14. RESULTS: Of 584 patients, 199 (34%) received HQN (5d RDV: n=57 [30%]; 10d RDV, n=49 [25%]; SoC: n=93 [47%]). Through median follow-up of 13d (range 1-41d), HQN(pos) patients on 5d or 10d RDV had a lower recovery rate (adjusted HR [95% CI] 0.78 [0.59, 1.03], p=0.09) with longer median time to recovery (8 vs 6 days) compared to HQN(neg). HQN(pos) compared to HQN(neg) patients in 5d RDV showed a trend of reduced recovery rate (HR: 0.69 [0.45,1.04], p=0.080); such an effect was not observed in 10d RDV or SoC (Table 1). More HQN(pos) than HQN(neg) patients had AEs in RDV (5/10d) or SoC arms evaluated separately, and all arms combined. This difference was significant for AEs and SAEs for all arms combined after covariate adjustment (Table 2). Table 1. [Image: see text] Table 2. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In moderate COVID-19 patients, concomitant HQN may delay recovery on RDV and showed no impact on recovery with SoC alone.

Methods: This study anonymously examined 2,734 psychiatric patients worldwide for worsening of their preexisting psychiatric conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. An independent clinical investigation of 318 psychiatric patients from United States was used for verification. Results: Valid responses mainly from 12 featured countries indicated self-reported worsening of psychiatric conditions in two-thirds of the patients assessed that was through their significantly higher scores on scales for general psychological disturbance, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression. Female gender, feeling no control of the situation, reporting dissatisfaction with the response of the state during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced interaction with family and friends increased the worsening of preexisting psychiatric conditions, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends, and using social media like usual were associated with less worsening. An independent clinical investigation from the United States confirmed worsening of psychiatric conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic based on identification of new symptoms that necessitated clinical interventions such as dose adjustment or starting new medications in more than half of the patients.

The authors performed a retrospective comparative analysis of two patient cohorts during the pilot at a large hospital system from 2015 to 2017. In screened patients (n = 85), images and examination were reviewed remotely by a neurosurgeon who made recommendations regarding transfer to a level 1 trauma center. In the unscreened group (n = 39), all patients were transferred. Baseline patient characteristics, outcomes, and costs were reviewed. Patient demographics were similar between cohorts. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was more common in screened patients (29.4% vs 12.8%, P = 0.02). The presence of midline shift >5 mm was comparable between groups. Among screened patients, 5 were transferred (5.8%) and one required evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma. In unscreened patients, 7 required evacuation of subdural hematoma. None of the screened patients who were not transferred deteriorated. Screened patients had significantly reduced average total cost compared to unscreened patients ($2,003 vs. $4,482, P = 0.03) despite similar lengths of stay (2.6 vs. 2.7 days, P = 0.85). In non-surgical patients, costs were less in the screened group ($2,025 vs. $2,939), although statistically insignificant (P = 0.38). In this pilot study, remote review of images and examination by a neurosurgeon was feasible to avoid unnecessary transfer of patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage and GCS 14C15.

The aim of this study is to delineate the prognostic importance of presence of concomitant cardiac injury on admission in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: For this multi-center retrospective study, data of consecutive patients who were treated for COVID-19 between 20 March and 20 April 2020 were collected. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and outcomes data were obtained from electronic medical records. In-hospital clinical outcome was compared between patients with and without cardiac injury. RESULTS: A total of 607 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the study; the median age was 62.5  14.3 years, and 334 (55%) were male. Cardiac injury was detected in 150 (24.7%) of patients included in the study. Mortality rate was higher in patients with cardiac injury (42% vs. 8%; P < 0.01). The frequency of patients who required ICU (72% vs. 19%), who developed acute kidney injury (14% vs. 1%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (71%vs. 18%) were also higher in patients with cardiac injury. In multivariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease (CAD), elevated CRP levels, and presence of cardiac injury [odds ratio (OR) 10.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42-46.27; P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of mortality. In subgroup analysis, including patients free of history of CAD, presence of cardiac injury on admission also predicted mortality (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.17-5.45; P = 0.018).

Outdoor workers are being exposed to increasing wildfire-related particulate matter and smoke. Recognizing this emerging risk, Washington adopted an emergency rule and is presently engaged in creating a permanent rule to protect outdoor workers from wildfire smoke exposure. While there are growing bodies of literature on the exposure to and health effects of wildfire smoke in the general public and wildland firefighters, there is a gap in knowledge about wildfire smoke exposure among outdoor workers generally and construction workers specificallya large category of outdoor workers in Washington totaling 200,000 people. Several data sources were linked in this studyincluding state-collected employment data and national ambient air quality datato gain insight into the risk of PM(2.5) exposure among construction workers and evaluate the impacts of different air quality thresholds that would have triggered a new Washington emergency wildfire smoke rule aimed at protecting workers from high PM(2.5) exposure. Results indicate the number of poor air quality days has increased in August and September in recent years. Over the last decade, these months with the greatest potential for particulate matter exposure coincided with an annual peak in construction employment that was typically 9.4C42.7% larger across Washington counties (one county was 75.8%). Lastly, the encouraged threshold of the Washington emergency rule (20.5 g m(?3)) would have resulted in 5.5 times more days subject to the wildfire rule on average across all Washington counties compared to its required threshold (55.5 g m(?3)), and in 2020, the rule could have created demand for 1.35 million N-95 filtering facepiece respirators among construction workers. These results have important implications for both employers and policy makers as rules are developed.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A UK-wide longitudinal qualitative study comprising online focus groups with email follow-up. METHOD: 50 participants were recruited from a previous qualitative study of the lived experience of long COVID-19 (n=23) and online support groups for people with persistent neurocognitive symptoms following COVID-19 (n=27). In remotely held focus groups, participants were invited to describe their neurocognitive symptoms and comment on others accounts. Individuals were followed up by email 4C6 months later. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded in NVIVO. They were analysed by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in general practice, clinical neuroscience, the sociology of chronic illness and service delivery, and checked by people with lived experience of brain fog. RESULTS: Of the 50 participants, 42 were female and 32 white British. Most had never been hospitalised for COVID-19. Qualitative analysis revealed the following themes: mixed views on the appropriateness of the term brain fog; rich descriptions of the experience of neurocognitive symptoms (especially executive function, attention, memory and language), accounts of how the illness fluctuatedand progressed over time; the profound psychosocial impact of the condition on relationships, personal and professional identity; self-perceptions of guilt, shame and stigma; strategies used for self-management; challenges accessing and navigating the healthcare system; and participants search for physical mechanisms to explain their symptoms. CONCLUSION: These qualitative findings complement research into the epidemiology and mechanisms of neurocognitive symptoms after COVID-19.

Air pollution has been shown to adversely impact lung development and has effects that extend beyond respiratory health. The goal of this study was to evaluate the indoor environment in public schools in the context of an ongoing urban renovation program to investigate the impact of school building renovation and replacement on indoor air quality. Indoor air quality (CO(2), PM(2.5), CO, and temperature) was assessed for two weeks during fall, winter, and spring seasons in 29 urban public schools between December 2015 and March 2020. Seven schools had pre- and post-renovation data available. Linear mixed models were used to examine changes in air quality outcomes by renovation status in the seven schools with pre- and post-renovation data. Prior to renovation, indoor CO measurements were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, and indoor PM(2.5) measurements rarely exceeded them. Within the seven schools with pre- and post-renovation data, over 30% of indoor CO(2) measurements and over 50% of indoor temperatures exceeded recommended guidelines from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers. Following renovation, 10% of indoor CO(2) measurements and 28% of indoor temperatures fell outside of the recommended ranges. Linear mixed models showed significant improvement in CO(2), indoor PM(2.5), and CO following school renovation. Even among schools that generally met recommendations on key guidelines, school renovation improved the indoor air quality. Our findings suggest that school renovation may benefit communities of children, particularly those in low-income areas with aging school infrastructure, through improvements in the indoor environment.","output":"Indoor Air Quality Prior to and Following School Building Renovation in a Mid-Atlantic School District"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-COV-2 becomes a global pandemic, many researchers have a concern about the long COVID-19 complications.

Wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective decontamination of feed mill surfaces; however, this is not practical on a commercial feed production scale. Another potential mitigation strategy would be using chemically treated rice hulls flushed through the feed manufacturing equipment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) or formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush batches as potential chemical mitigation strategies for PEDV during feed manufacturing. Feed without evidence of PEDV RNA contamination was inoculated with PEDV. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, this feed had a cycle threshold (Ct) = 30.2 and was confirmed infective in bioassay. After manufacturing the PEDV-positive feed, untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA- (a 1:1:1 blend of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) treated rice hulls, or 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls were flushed through laboratory scale mixers. For the untreated rice hulls, 3 of 6 samples had detectable PEDV RNA, whereas 1 of 6 formaldehyde-treated rice hull flush samples and 2 of 6 of the 2% MCFA rice hull flush samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, PEDV RNA was not detected in any of the 10% MCFA rice hull flush samples. Then, rice hulls treated with 10% MCFA were mixed and discharged through a production scale mixer and bucket elevator following PEDV-positive feed. No rice hull flush or feed samples from the mixer following chemically treated rice hull flush had detectible PEDV RNA. However, one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible PEDV RNA. Dust collected following mixing of PEDV contaminated feed had detectable PEDV RNA (Ct = 29.4) and was infectious. However, dust collected immediately after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batch had a reduced quantity of PEDV RNA (Ct = 33.7) and did not cause infection. Overall, the use of rice hull flushes effectively reduced the quantity of detectible RNA present after mixing a batch of PEDV-positive feed. Chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde or 10% MCFA provided additional reduction in detectible RNA. Finally, dust collected after manufacturing PEDV-inoculated feed has the potential to serve as a vector for PEDV transmission.","output":"Evaluation of the effects of flushing feed manufacturing equipment with chemically treated rice hulls on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus cross-contamination during feed manufacturing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries around the world have mobilised health, social, and economic resources to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since its discovery in December 2019.

Rheumatic diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases, the prevalence and impact of which in COVID-19 patients are poorly known. We performed a pooled analysis of published data intending to summarize clinical presentation and patient outcomes in those with established rheumatic disease diagnosis and concurrent COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies reporting data about rheumatic disease patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and published until July 22, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled incidence and rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality among these patients, and interstudy heterogeneity was identified using I2 statistics with greater than 75% value indicating substantial interstudy variation. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included, giving a total sample size of 49,099 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 49,099 COVID-19 patients, a total of 1382 were also diagnosed with a rheumatic disease in the past. The random-effects pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among rheumatic disease patients was found to be 0.9%. The rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were 70.7%, 11.6%, and 10.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not dramatically high in rheumatic disease patients, concurrent COVID-19 does seem to play a role in determining disease severity and outcomes to some extent.

Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). SensitivitySpecificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products).

Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was  30C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.","output":"Implementing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Fibrin glue was used for anastomosis of lacrimal sac and nasal mucosal flaps and was compared with the conventional suture technique in external dacryocystorhinostomy. METHODS: A prospective interventional randomized control study in which 50 consecutive patients of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) were equally allocated into two groups. The case group underwent glued technique of external dacryocystorhinostomy (Ext DCR) in which fibrin glue was used for the apposition of the anterior lacrimal sac and nasal mucosal flaps. In the control group, conventional technique of Ext DCR was used to suture the flaps. Functional success was assessed by improvement in epiphora and fluorescein dye disappearance test (FDDT), whereas anatomical success was assessed by lacrimal irrigation and endoscopic view of the osteotomy site. RESULTS: The anatomical success in both the groups was 92%, whereas the functional success was 92% in the case group and 88% in the control group. The difference in the success rates between the two groups was statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: Glued technique of Ext DCR is a simple and easy alternative to suturing of the flaps. Though the final outcome was comparable in both the groups, glue can be especially useful in uncooperative cases, in cases of excessive bleeding, or in situations where the flaps are very thin or have become friable.","output":"A glued technique of external dacryocystorhinostomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic cause a high burden of psychological distress in people worldwide. Interventions to enable people to better cope with such distress should be based on the best available evidence. We therefore performed a scoping review to systematically identify and summarize the available literature of interventions that target the distress of people in the face of highly contagious disease outbreaks. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science (January 2000 to May 7, 2020), and reference lists were systematically searched and screened by two independent reviewers. Quantitative and qualitative studies investigating the effects of psychological interventions before, during, and after outbreaks of highly contagious emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, or COVID-19 were included. Study effects were grouped (e.g. for healthcare professionals, community members, people at risk) and intervention contents at the individual and organizational level summarized. We assessed the level of evidence using a modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. RESULTS: Of 4030 records found, 19 studies were included (two RCTs). Most interventions were delivered during-exposure and face-to-face, focused on healthcare workers and crisis personnel, and combined psychoeducation with training of coping strategies. Based on two high-quality studies, beneficial effects were reported for resilience factors (e.g. positive cognitive appraisal) and professional attitudes of healthcare workers, with mixed findings for mental health (e.g. depression). Across all studies, there was positive qualitative feedback from participants and facilitators. We identified seven ongoing studies mostly using online- and mobile-based deliveries. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of interventions to enable people to better cope with the distress of highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks. Besides the need for more high-quality studies, the summarized evidence may inform decision makers to plan interventions during the current pandemic and to develop pandemic preparedness plans.","output":"Mental health and psychosocial support strategies in highly contagious emerging disease outbreaks of substantial public concern: A systematic scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The objective of this project was to develop new transition resources to support young people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their families during a time that can be detrimental to health and well-being, and equip them with the skills needed to have a successful and supported transition. Methods: The Cystic Fibrosis Trust consulted with over 30 young people with CF and their parents to hear about their experiences of transition.We found that, overall, young people were excited about the opportunity for independence,while parents had reservations about passing responsibility onto their children. Parents and young people, the Trusts Youth Advisory Group and Clinical Advisory Group, and a young key worker in CF paediatrics gave feedback on a proposal for the resources, and reviewed the resources through development and production. All feedback was shared with a design agency, who created designs for the resources. Due to restrictions around Covid-19, instead of using photography, the agency created illustrations and animations, using the tagline Wewant you to feel listened to and empowered, whatever shape it takes! to represent the changes families go through during transition. The final resources include a booklet for young people and four activity sheets, a booklet for parents and carers, and an interactive hub on the Trusts website. Results: The resources were published and promoted in December 2020. Since their release, the resources have been ordered 76 times, and downloaded over 245 times. Feedback on the resources has been positive, and parents have shared their experiences of the challenges this time brought up for their families. Conclusion: Transition is a challenging time for young people with CF and their families.

The online landscape and patterns of information consumption, however, have notably changed over the past decade necessitating an updated examination of health-related internet use (HRIU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Using survey data from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) iterations, the objectives of this study were to report prevalence, trends, and user profiles in HRIU in terms of emailing doctors, buying medicine online, and support group participation. Descriptive analyses and weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Cancer survivors who reported not using the internet were more likely to be older, belong to ethnic minorities, be less educated, and reside in rural areas as compared with those who reported using the internet. Except for participation in online support groups, all other types of HRIU increased in prevalence across the years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the increased penetration of the internet and the altered online health communication landscape, we found increased prevalence of HRIU among cancer survivors. However, the digital divide persists in terms of internet access. These findings can inform initiatives to bridge the gap among survivors of varying profiles in using the internet for their health needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is increased reliance on online platforms to obtain and communicate health-related information. The risk with this approach is potential oversight of ensuring equity in terms of internet access and technology literacy among survivors.","output":"Persistent digital divide in health-related internet use among cancer survivors: findings from the Health Information National Trends Survey, 2003-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive number of attempts on the predictions of the number of cases and the other future trends of this pandemic have been made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable way, the medium and long term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models, which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors, cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models. The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection. Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19 data.","output":"Curse of Small Sample Size in Forecasting of the Active Cases in COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a Current Issue because, at the time of writing, COVID-19 has affected many countries and territories worldwide and Iran ranked early on as one of the most seriously affected countries.

One principled idea is to mine implicit relevance feedback from user behavior recorded in search engine logs. All previous works on mining implicit relevance feedback target at relevance of web documents rather than passages. Due to several unique characteristics of QA tasks, the existing user behavior models for web documents cannot be applied to infer passage relevance. In this paper, we make the first study to explore the correlation between user behavior and passage relevance, and propose a novel approach for mining training data for Web QA. We conduct extensive experiments on four test datasets and the results show our approach significantly improves the accuracy of passage ranking without extra human labeled data. In practice, this work has proved effective to substantially reduce the human labeling cost for the QA service in a global commercial search engine, especially for languages with low resources.

Unwanted side effects from oral or inhaled cannabinoids remain, however, a major barrier to widespread use. Peripherally acting cannabinoids (eg, topically applied) may circumvent these side effects while providing localized pain management. OBJECTIVE Our purpose was to systematically review the literature on the effectiveness of peripherally acting cannabinoids for pain management. EVIDENCE REVIEW We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PubMed databases. Included studies examined the effect of topical/peripherally administered cannabinoids on pain ratings in humans, as well as pain-related outcomes in animals (eg, paw withdrawal). Due to a lack of trials, human studies were summarized in a narrative synthesis. Separate meta-analyses were performed for animal studies using radiant tail flick or paw withdrawal outcomes. FINDINGS Our search yielded 1182 studies following removal of duplicates, with 46 studies (6 human, 40 animal) included. Human studies (one randomized controlled trial and five case studies/series) reported no adverse events to topical cannabinoids and preliminary evidence of decreased pain ratings. Animal studies reporting tail flick (5) (2.81, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.69, p<0.001) and mechanical withdrawal (11) (2.74, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.67, p<0.001) reported prolonged responses (analgesia) in peripheral cannabinoid groups compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS Preclinical animal studies provided low-quality evidence for peripherally administered cannabinoids to provide regional, antinociceptive effects.

However, the emerging fungal infection caused by these fungi, known as mucormycosis, has prompted many researchers to study the pathogenic potential of Mucorales. The main reasons for this current attraction to study mucormycosis are its high lethality, the lack of effective antifungal drugs, and its recent increased incidence. The most contemporary example of the emergence character of mucormycosis is the epidemics declared in several Asian countries as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fortunately, this pressure to understand mucormycosis and develop new treatment strategies has encouraged the blossoming of new genetic techniques and methodologies. This review describes the history of genetic manipulation in Mucorales, highlighting the development of methods and how they allowed the main genetic studies in these fungi.

This meant that there were no fans in attendance, games played on neutral courts and no traveling for teams, which in theory removes home-court advantage from the games. This setting has attracted much discussion as analysts and fans debated the possible effects it may have on the outcome of games. Home-court advantage has historically played an influential role in NBA playoff series outcomes. The 2020 playoff provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of the bubble and home-court advantage by comparing the 2020 season with the seasons in the past. While many factors contribute to the outcome of games, points scored is the deciding factor of who wins games, so scoring is the primary focus of this study. The specific measures of interest are team scoring totals and team shooting percentage on two-pointers, three-pointers, and free throws. Comparing these measures for home teams and away teams in 2020 vs. 2017-2019 shows that the 2020 playoffs favored away teams more than usual, particularly with two point shooting and total scoring.","output":"The Effects of the NBA COVID Bubble on the NBA Playoffs: A Case Study for Home-Court Advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To better understand the biology of COVID-19, we have explored the behavior of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), an angiogenic, vasodilating, and immune modulating peptide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. METHODS: Levels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens. RESULTS: CGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response.

The thematic analysis revealed how some nurses have boycotted corporate choices in favor of child's and family's well-being, while others have consolidated the idea that NICUs must remain closed. Moreover, nurses report that they standardized their practice rather than individualize care. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 limitations created many inconveniences and negatively impacted the quality of the care provided, as the safety of the discharge of these fragile patients. NURSING IMPLICATIONS: It is important to evaluate how this situation impacts long-term patient outcomes, but also how some organizational decisions influence the well-being of professionals, who facing difficult choices, during a health emergency.

India launched the Special newborn care unit (SNCU) Quality of Care Index (SQCI) for measuring quality indicators in SNCU. The USAID Vriddhi project provided support to the use of SQCI in 19 SNCU across aspirational districts of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. The objective was to provide holistic support to quality care processes by generating analyzed quarterly reports for action with the goal toward sustainability by capacitating SNCU personnel and program officers to use SQCI, over a 1period from April 2019 to June 2020. The composite index has seven indicators and converts them into indices, each having a range from 0.1 to 1, to measure performance of SNCU.7 of the 18 SNCU improved their composite scores from the first to the last quarter. Rational use of antibiotics showed improvement in 12 SNCU. Survival in newborns >2500 g and <2500, low birth weight admission and optimal bed utilization had the most variations between and within facilities. Based on quarterly data analysis, all facilities introduced KMC, 10 facilities improved equipment and drug supply, 9 facilities launched in-house capacity building to improve asphyxia management. The SQCI implementation helped to show a process of using SQCI data for identifying bottlenecks and addressing quality concerns. The project has transitioned to complete responsibility of SQCI usage by the district and facility teams. Use of an existing mechanism of quality monitoring without any major external support makes the SQCI usable and doable.","output":"Addressing Quality of Care in Pediatric Units using a Digital Tool: Implementation Experience from 18 SNCU of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Early childhood caries (ECC) remains the most common, preventable infectious disease among children in the United States. Screening is recommended after the eruption of the first tooth, but it is unclear how the age at first dental examination is associated with eventual restorative treatment needs. The authors of this study sought to determine how provider type and age at first dental examination are associated longitudinally with caries experience among children in the United States. METHODS Deidentified claims data were included for 706,636 privately insured children aged 0 through 6 years as part of the nationwide IBM Watson Health Market Scan (2012-2017). The authors used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to describe the association between the age of first visit and restorative treatment needs. RESULTS A total of 21% of this population required restorative treatment, and the average age at first dental examination was 3.6 years. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed increased hazard for restorative treatment with age at first dental visit at 3 years (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.97 to 2.13) and 4 years (hazard ratio, 3.99; 95% CI, 3.84 to 4.16). CONCLUSION The high proportion of children requiring restorative treatment and late age at first dental screening show needed investments in educating general dentists, medical students, and pediatricians about oral health guidelines for pediatric patients. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Communicating the importance of children establishing a dental home by age 1 year to parents and health care professionals may help reduce disease burden in children younger than 6 years.","output":"Association between first oral examination characteristics and dental treatment needs in privately insured children: A claims data analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a huge public health issue. Hence, we devised a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mRT-LAMP) coupled with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) assay (mRT-LAMP-LFB) for diagnosing COVID-19. Using two LAMP primer sets, the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified in a single-tube reaction, and detected with the diagnosis results easily interpreted by LFB. In presence of FITC (fluorescein)-/digoxin- and biotin-labeled primers, mRT-LAMP produced numerous FITC-/digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons, which were determined by LFB through immunoreactions (FITC/digoxin on the duplex and anti-FITC/digoxin on the test line of LFB) and biotin/treptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and strptavidin on the polymerase nanoparticle). The accumulation of nanoparticles leaded a characteristic crimson band, enabling multiplex analysis of ORF1ab and N gene without instrumentation. The limit of detection (LoD) of COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB was 12 copies (for each detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33 oropharynx swab samples collected from COVID-19 patients), and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96 oropharynx swab samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients). The total diagnostic test can be completed within 1 h from sample collection to result interpretation. In sum, the COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB assay is a promising tool for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections in frontline public health field and clinical laboratories, especially from resource-poor regions.","output":"Multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces the SPE Theme on the Political Economy of COVID-19.","output":"The political economy of COVID-19: Canadian and comparative perspectives  an introduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea in a sample of adult women.

There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","output":"The transmissibility of novel Coronavirus in the early stages of the 2019-20 outbreak in Wuhan: Exploring initial point-source exposure sizes and durations using scenario analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As death returned to make its mark on the world with the COVID-19 pandemic and, consequently, resurfaced in the social imaginary, we have found ourselves once again full-throatedly asking questions about what it means to die well. These issues lie at the heart of W;t, an American play penned in the early 1990s by Margaret Edson, which could be situated alongside other fictional and true stories that provide social scripts for dying (Knox). The play might also be viewed as a modern reference to the medieval tradition of ars bene moriendi and the morality plays linked with that tradition in a symbiotic, synergistic manner. The essay attempts to demonstrate that the meaning underlying Edsons play (and its television adaptation of 2001) derives primarily from its grappling with the subject of humans agency in the face of the inevitable. In its close reading of the play, the essay moves between the text, first published in print in 1999, and the screen, to best tap into the interpretive potential of comparing the drama and its film adaptation. ? 2021 Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu im.

This study aimed to develop an efficient deep\\\\learning artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help clinicians triage COVID\\\\19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21, 2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78 clinical variables. A deep\\\\learning algorithm and a risk stratification score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing. Prediction performance were compared with those using COVID\\\\19 severity score, CURB\\\\65 score and pneumonia severity index (PSI). RESULTS: Of the 181 COVID\\\\19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five top predictors of mortality were D\\\\dimer, O(2) Index, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C\\\\reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 ([95% CI:0.87\\\\1.0]) and 0.954 ([95% CI:0.80\\\\0.99]) for the testing dataset.

METHODS: Recruitment occurred between June and August 2020 in New South Wales, Australia. Demographic information, symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), generalised anxiety (GAD-7), and COVID-19-related anxieties around infections, help-seeking behaviours, and work and social functioning (WSAS) were collected. RESULTS: About one third (n=73, 33%) had cared for a patient with overt or covert COVID-19 in the previous month. However, the extent of COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms was largely unrelated to caring for COVID-19 patients. Instead, the presence of other COVID-19 concerns and gender predicted variations in COVID-19 concerns for one's own safety and the safety of loved ones. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 anxiety symptoms were largely unrelated to caring for COVID-19 patients, while COVID-19-related anxiety around the safety of family and friends added to impaired functioning in addition to the established impact of depression and general anxiety.

Extracellular stimuli are sensed, amplified, and transduced through a dynamic cellular network of messengers converting the first signal into a proper response: production of specific mediators, cell activation, survival, or death. Several overlapping pathways are coordinated to ensure specific and timely induction of inflammation to neutralize potential harms to the tissue. Ideally, the inflammatory response must be controlled and self-limited. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that culminates with termination of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Comparably to the onset of inflammation, resolution responses are triggered by coordinated intracellular signaling pathways that transduce the message to the nucleus. However, the key messengers and pathways involved in signaling transduction for resolution are still poorly understood in comparison to the inflammatory network. cAMP has long been recognized as an inducer of anti-inflammatory responses and cAMP-dependent pathways have been extensively exploited pharmacologically to treat inflammatory diseases. Recently, cAMP has been pointed out as coordinator of key steps of resolution of inflammation. Here, we summarize the evidence for the role of cAMP at inducing important features of resolution of inflammation.","output":"Blame the signaling: role of cAMP for the resolution of inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International supply chains generate substantial amounts of CO2 emissions.

Furthermore, there is no standard method for obtaining whole-genome sequences in non-related patients. After polyA RNA isolation and sequencing in eight patients with acute gastroenteritis, we evaluated two de Bruijn graph assemblers (SPAdes and MEGAHIT), combined with four different and common pre-assembly strategies, and compared those yielding whole genome Norovirus contigs. RESULTS: Reference-genome guided strategies with both host and target virus did not present any advantages compared to the assembly of non-filtered data in the case of SPAdes, and in the case of MEGAHIT, only host genome filtering presented improvements. MEGAHIT performed better than SPAdes in most samples, reaching complete genome sequences in most of them for all the strategies employed. Read binning with CD-HIT improved assembly when paired with different analysis strategies, and more notably in the case of SPAdes. CONCLUSIONS: Not all metagenome assemblies are equal and the choice in the workflow depends on the species studied and the prior steps to analysis. We may need different approaches even for samples treated equally due to the presence of high intra host variability. We tested and compared different workflows for the accurate assembly of Norovirus genomes and established their assembly capacities for this purpose.

To better understand the physiological role of SLC38A9, we first described the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the slc38a9 gene in zebrafish. A quarter of slc38a9-/- mutant embryos developed pericardial edema and died prematurely, while the remaining mutants were viable and grew normally.

The change of glycolysis-related metabolites in viable slc38a9-/- mutant fish was ameliorated. Moreover, loss of slc38a9 resulted in a significant reduction in hypoxia-inducible gene expression and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1) protein levels.

Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale. These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption. Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine challenges: What have we learned so far and what remains to be done?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Droplets and contacts serve as the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The characteristic of the disease is rather heterogeneous, ranging from no symptoms to critical illness. The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date. Inspired by previous studies on the relevance of infectious diseases, viral and host factors related to clinical outcomes have been identified. The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage. In addition, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy and anti-infective therapy with antibiotics are recommended in the hyperactivation stage.","output":"Cellular Immune Response to COVID-19 and Potential Immune Modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Widespread fear surrounding COVID-19, coupled with physical and social distancing orders, has caused severe adverse mental health outcomes. Little is known, however, about how the COVID-19 crisis has impacted LGBTQ+ youth, who disproportionately experienced a high rate of adverse mental health outcomes before the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to address this knowledge gap by harnessing natural language processing methodologies to investigate the evolution of conversation topics in the most popular subreddit for LGBTQ+ youth. METHODS: We generated a data set of all r/LGBTeens subreddit posts (n=39,389) between January 1, 2020 and February 1, 2021 and analyzed meaningful trends in anxiety, anger, and sadness in the posts. Because the distribution of anxiety before widespread social distancing orders was meaningfully different from the distribution after (P<.001), we employed latent Dirichlet allocation to examine topics that provoked this shift in anxiety. RESULTS: We did not find any differences in LGBTQ+ youth anger and sadness before and after government-mandated social distancing; however, anxiety increased significantly (P<.001). Further analysis revealed a list of 10 anxiety-provoking topics discussed during the pandemic: attraction to a friend, coming out, coming out to family, discrimination, education, exploring sexuality, gender pronouns, love and relationship advice, starting a new relationship, and struggling with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+ teens increased their reliance on anonymous discussion forums when discussing anxiety-provoking topics. LGBTQ+ teens likely perceived anonymous forums as safe spaces for discussing lifestyle stressors during COVID-19 disruptions (eg, school closures). The list of prevalent anxiety-provoking topics in LGBTQ+ teens anonymous discussions can inform future mental health interventions in LGBTQ+ youth.","output":"Natural Language Processing Insight into LGBTQ+ Youth Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Content Analysis of Anxiety-Provoking Topics and Trends in Emotion in LGBTeens Microcommunity Subreddit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The exploration and identification of safe and effective vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has captured the worlds attention and remains an ongoing issue in order to protect against emerging variants of concern (VoCs) while generating long lasting immunity.

In efforts to continually improve immunity, a lymphatic drug delivery device (MuVaxx) was engineered and tested to modulate immune cells at the injection site (epidermis and dermis) and draining lymph node (LN) to elicit adaptive immunity. Using MuVaxx, immune responses were elicited and maintained at a 10-fold dose reduction compared to traditional intramuscular (IM) administration as measured by anti-spike antibodies, cytokine producing CD8 T cells, and neutralizing antibodies against the Washington (Wild Type, WT) and South African (beta) variants. Remarkably, a 4-fold elevated T cell response was observed in MuVaxx administered vaccination as compared to that of IM administered vaccination.

Results: Social media platform users (n = 205) were surveyed using a two-part questionnaire. The 1 st part elicited the socio-demographic characteristics of the subject. In the 2 nd part, information about their exercise and physical activity, general health, and economic palliatives as offered by the government, non-governmental organizations, and philanthropists were elicited. The frequency of exercise was significantly more (p < 0.05) during the lockdown than before the lockdown. The duration and intensity of the exercise per week were comparable. There was also a negative relationship between the Body Mass Index, frequency, and duration of exercise before and during the lockdown. The subjects also perceived their health as worse during (3.70  1.05) the lockdown than before (3.95  0.97) lockdown (Z = -3.69, p = 0.00). Conclusion: Overall, for these cohorts of social media platform users, lockdown did not adversely affect their exercise routine.

METHODS Men aged 50-70 who failed medical treatment of BPO with AUR failing to wean off urethral catheter were recruited to undergo Aquablation. Individuals were assessed pre-operatively and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. The primary outcome was defined by the success rate of weaning off catheter. Secondary outcomes were measured by a change in prostate size, symptom scores and urodynamic parameters. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent Aquablation between June 2019 and September 2020. Mean duration of the urethral catheter in-situ was 5.9  4.9 weeks and mean prostate size of the cohort pre-operatively was 60.8  15.8 cc. A second pass Aqaublation treatment was performed in 14 patients. Five patients failed to wean off the catheter on the first attempt after surgery, requiring another attempt 1 week later which were all successful. At 3 months after the operation, a significant reduction in prostate volume was observed (60.8  15.8 cc vs 24.9  10.3 cc, p < 0.001). No change in international index of erectile function (IIEF) was found (baseline: 16.1  5.8; 3-month: 14.9  6.4; p = 0.953). Mean bladder outlet obstruction index was 14.2  23.0 at 6 months upon urodynamic assessment with 75% of patients had a resolution of detrusor overactivity. Reduction in prostate length was found to be more significant than a reduction in width and height after Aquablation (R = 0.693, p = 0.039). CONCLUSION From the early data of a single centre, Aquablation was shown to provide a consistent improvement in symptoms, uroflowmetry and urodynamic parameters in patient with a urethral catheter.

Pooling individual participant data (IPD), including unanalyzed data from trials terminated early, enables further investigation of the efficacy and safety of HCQ/CQ. OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy of HCQ/CQ in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, both overall and in prespecified subgroups. DATA SOURCES: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched multiple times in May-June 2020. Principal investigators of US-based RCTs evaluating HCQ/CQ in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were invited to collaborate in this IPD meta-analysis. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs in which: (1) HCQ/CQ was a treatment arm; (2) patient informed consent and/or individual study IRB approval allowed for data sharing; (3) principal investigators/their institutions signed a data use agreement for the present study; and (4) the outcomes defined in this study were recorded or could be extrapolated. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Wherever possible, harmonized de-identified data were collected via a common template spreadsheet sent to each principal investigator, then shared via a secure online data sharing platform to create a pooled data set. When this was not possible, individual study data were harmonized and merged manually. Data were analyzed by fitting a prespecified Bayesian ordinal regression model and standardizing the resulting predictions. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): 7-point ordinal scale, measured between day 28 and 35 post-enrollment. RESULTS: Eight of 19 trials met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate. Patient-level data were available from 770 participants (412 HCQ/CQ vs 358 control). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. We found no evidence of a difference in ordinal scores between days 28 and 35 post-enrollment in the pooled patient population (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% credible interval, 0.76C1.24; higher favors HCQ/CQ), and no convincing evidence of meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Adverse event and serious adverse event rates were numerically higher with HCQ/CQ vs control (0.39 vs 0.29 and 0.13 vs 0.09 per patient, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this IPD meta-analysis reinforce those of individual RCTs that HCQ/CQ is not efficacious for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: An Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: This study provides a profile of work-related Covid-19 cases reported by physicians to the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority (NLIA) Methods: Reported cases of work-related SARS-COV-2 viral infection by a physician to the NLIAs Registry for Work-Related Diseases (RAS) between February 2020 and June 2021 were included. Descriptive statistics for age, gender, industrial sector, and occupation were calculated. Further, the incidence rates (cases per 100 000 workers) were computed for age, gender and occupation. Results: Physicians reported a total of 182 work-related Covid-19 cases during the study period. Sixty-four percent of the cases were females (n = 117) and 36 % (n = 65) were males. Eighty-six per cent of the cases were reported from the healthcare sector (n = 157). The remaining cases (n = 25) were distributed among other sectors.

To facilitate the design of biosensors for infectious organisms in commercial aircraft, we characterized bacterial diversity in aircraft air. Samples from 61 aircraft high\\\\efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were analyzed with a custom microarray of 16S rRNA gene sequences (PhyloChip), representing bacterial lineages. A total of 606 subfamilies from 41 phyla were detected. The most abundant bacterial subfamilies included bacteria associated with humans, especially skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and with water and soil habitats. Operational taxonomic units that contain important human pathogens as well as their close, more benign relatives were detected. When compared to 43 samples of urban outdoor air, aircraft samples differed in composition, with higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria lineages in aircraft samples, and higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria lineages in outdoor air samples. In addition, aircraft and outdoor air samples differed in the incidence of taxa containing human pathogens. Overall, these results demonstrate that HEPA filter samples can be used to deeply characterize bacterial diversity in aircraft air and suggest that the presence of close relatives of certain pathogens must be taken into account in probe design for aircraft biosensors. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: A biosensor that could be deployed in commercial aircraft would be required to function at an extremely low false alarm rate, making an understanding of microbial background important. This study reveals a diverse bacterial background present on aircraft, including bacteria closely related to pathogens of public health concern. Furthermore, this aircraft background is different from outdoor air, suggesting different probes may be needed to detect airborne contaminants to achieve minimal false alarm rates.

We here focus on the S2' motif which, during virus entry, requires cleavage by a cell surface protease to release the fusion peptide. Though belonging to an immunogenic region, the SARS-CoV-2 S2' motif (811-KPSKR-815) has shown hardly any variation, with its three basic (K/R) residues being >99.99% conserved thus far. By creating a series of mutant S-pseudotyped viruses, we show that K814, which precedes the scissile R815 residue, is dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation by TMPRSS2 but not TMPRSS13. The latter protease lost its activity towards SARS-CoV-2 S when the S2' motif was swapped with that of the low pathogenic 229E coronavirus (685-RVAGR-689) and also the reverse effect was seen. This swap had no impact on TMPRSS2 activation. Also in the MERS-CoV spike, introducing a dibasic scissile motif was fully accepted by TMPRSS13 but less so by TMPRSS2. Our findings are the first to demonstrate which S2' residues are important for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation by these two airway proteases, with TMPRSS13 exhibiting higher preference for K/R rich motifs than TMPRSS2.

However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. METHODS: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages 'Pangolin' tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. RESULTS: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. Additionally, three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries.

Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural protein of the virion, promotes the virus-triggered activation of NF-B signaling. After binding to viral RNA, N protein robustly undergoes liquidCliquid phase separation (LLPS), which recruits TAK1 and IKK complex, the key kinases of NF-B signaling, to enhance NF-B activation. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol, the inhibitor of LLPS, can attenuate the phase separation of N protein and restrict its regulatory functions in NF-B activation. These results suggest that LLPS of N protein provides a platform to induce NF-B hyper-activation, which could be a potential therapeutic target against COVID-19 severe pneumonia.","output":"RNA-induced liquid phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein facilitates NF-B hyper-activation and inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social restrictions reduced the rates of respiratory infections in 2020, but studies on the rates of urinary tract infections (UTIs) during lockdown have had conflicting results.

Methods: We included 178 confirmed adult inpatients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Union Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). Patients were classified into common types, and all were cured and discharged after hospitalization. We recorded the time of the first clinical symptoms of the patients and performed blood coagulation tests at the time of admission and after admission. In total, eight factors (TT, FIB, INR, APTT, PT, , ATIII, and FDP) were analyzed. Patients were classified into four groups according to the time from the first symptom onset to hospital admission for comparative analysis. The patients who were admitted within 2 weeks of disease onset were analyzed for the dynamic changes in their blood coagulation tests. Further division into two groups, one group comprising patients admitted to the hospital within 2 weeks after the onset of disease and the other comprising patients admitted to the hospital 2 weeks after disease onset, was performed to form two groups based on whether the patient ages were over or under 55 years. Chi-square tests and T tests were used to explore the dynamic changes in coagulation function and the influence of age on the results of coagulation function tests. Results: A total of 178 inpatients, 34 of whom underwent dynamic detection, were included in this analysis. We divided these patients into four groups according to the interval between the onset of COVID-19 pneumonia and the time to admission in the hospital: the 1C7 days (group 1), 8C14 days (group 2), 15C21 days (group 3), and >21-days (group 4). Eight factors all increased within 2 weeks after onset and gradually decreased to normal 2 weeks before the patient was admitted. The changes in coagulation function of patients admitted to the hospital were similar. After being admitted to the hospital, the most significant decreases among the eight factors were between week 2 and 3. There were distinct differences among the eight factors between people older than 55 years and those younger than 55 years.

The purpose of this case report is to describe a novel approach to implementing early mobility interventions for a patient who was pregnant and receiving ECMO while continuing necessary infectious disease precautions because of diagnosed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 27-year old woman who was pregnant was admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 and rapidly developed acute respiratory failure requiring 9 days of ECMO support. After a physical therapist consultation, the patient was standing at the bedside by hospital day 5 and ambulating by hospital day 9. RESULTS: The patient safely participated in physical therapy during ICU admission and was discharged to home with outpatient physical therapy follow-up after 14 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Early mobility is feasible during ECMO with COVID-19, and active participation in physical therapy, including in-room ambulation, may facilitate discharge to home. Innovative strategies to facilitate routine activity in a patient who is critically ill with COVID-19 require an established and highly trained team with a focus on maintaining function. IMPACT: Early mobility while intubated, on ECMO, and infected with COVID-19 is feasible while adhering to infectious disease precautions when it is performed by an experienced interdisciplinary team.","output":"Maintaining Mobility in a Patient Who Is Pregnant and Has COVID-19 Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Having studied several examples, historic and contemporary, of luxury fashion brands that have isolated specific elements in the cultural landscape and introduced them into innovative design that changed the course of fashion history, it is time to review the steps one can follow in applying the Transmedia Fashion Production framework to enrich the creative work in a luxury fashion brand.

Data about the presence of smell loss, the onset of smell loss and other COVID-19 symptoms such as ageusia and nasal congestion or rhinorrhea were recorded. All patients at the initial consultation and 34 healthy controls underwent the Q-SIT, which is a quick disposable three-item smell identification test, by a trained physician. We compared three groups: healthy controls, COVID+ patients with reported smell loss (COVID w/ SL) and COVID+ patients without smell loss (COVID+ w/o SL). The mean age of patients was 41.4 years (SD  10.4), and 54.4% were women. Smell loss was reported by 40.4% of COVID-19 patients.

This study examined the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by measuring the expression of antiviral genestumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1)in G6PD-knockdown cells upon human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the promoter activities of TNF- and MX1 were downregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells, and that the IB degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-B were decreased. The HSCARG protein, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) sensor and negative regulator of NF-B, was upregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells with decreased NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. Treatment of G6PD-knockdown cells with siRNA against HSCARG enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-B and the expression of TNF- and MX1, but suppressed the expression of viral genes; however, the overexpression of HSCARG inhibited the antiviral response. Exogenous G6PD or IDH1 expression inhibited the expression of HSCARG, resulting in increased expression of TNF- and MX1 and reduced viral gene expression upon virus infection. Our findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of the G6PD-knockdown cells to viral infection was due to impaired NF-B signaling and antiviral response mediated by HSCARG.","output":"Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Enhances Antiviral Response through Downregulation of NADPH Sensor HSCARG and Upregulation of NF-B Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization is yet to realise the global aim of achieving future-free and eliminating the transmission of respiratory diseases such as H1N1, SARS and Ebola since the recent reemergence of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The viral trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein uses an archetypal arginine-rich motif (ARM) to recruit the host positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb) complex onto the viral trans-activation response (TAR) RNA, leading to activation of HIV transcription. Efforts to block this interaction have stimulated production of biologics designed to disrupt this essential RNA-protein interface. Here, we present four co-crystal structures of lab-evolved TAR-binding proteins (TBPs) in complex with HIV-1 TAR. Our results reveal that high-affinity binding requires a distinct sequence and spacing of arginines within a specific 2-3 hairpin loop that arose during selection. Although loops with as many as five arginines were analyzed, only three arginines could bind simultaneously with major-groove guanines. Amino acids that promote backbone interactions within the 2-3 loop were also observed to be important for high-affinity interactions. Based on structural and affinity analyses, we designed two cyclic peptide mimics of the TAR-binding 2-3 loop sequences present in two high-affinity TBPs (K(D) values of 4.2  0.3 and 3.0  0.3 nm). Our efforts yielded low-molecular weight compounds that bind TAR with low micromolar affinity (K(D) values ranging from 3.6 to 22 m). Significantly, one cyclic compound within this series blocked binding of the Tat-ARM peptide to TAR in solution assays, whereas its linear counterpart did not. Overall, this work provides insight into protein-mediated TAR recognition and lays the ground for the development of cyclic peptide inhibitors of a vital HIV-1 RNA-protein interaction.","output":"Co-crystal structures of HIV TAR RNA bound to lab-evolved proteins show key roles for arginine relevant to the design of cyclic peptide TAR inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Esophageal achalasia is a rare entity in children. However, young age is a factor of failure of conservative treatment, emphasizing the role of surgery. In our institution laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy is the chosen procedure for surgical treatment. AIM To assess the outcome of surgery for achalasia treatment in children operated on in a single institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive patient records from the years 1997 to 2014 was performed. There were 11 patients. Their mean age was 13 years, ranging from 6 to 17. Duration of symptoms was 2 to 36 months, mean 16. All 11 patients were operated on with a laparoscopic approach. Pneumatic dilatation was used both pre- and postoperatively but in no case was sufficient on its own. Collected data included patient demographics, preoperative symptoms and their duration, diagnostic findings and therapeutic means. Surgical procedures, complications and long-term follow-up were analyzed. The follow-up lasted from 1 to 10 years and finished when the patient reached 18 years of age. RESULTS Twelve laparoscopic cardiomyotomies were performed with concomitant fundoplications, 10 Toupet and 2 Dor and one redo procedure. There were no deaths. Two perforations were repaired promptly. The success rate was 82%, though with subsequent dilatations. One failure was due to serious progression of the disease. CONCLUSIONS In our opinion, laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice for treating achalasia in children. Endoscopic balloon dilatation may be used as a complementary treatment, especially as a primary redo procedure.","output":"Pediatric achalasia.

NPIs are considered to be critical in order to at least delay the peak number of infected individuals and to prevent the health care system becoming overwhelmed by the number of patients to treat in hospitals or in intensive care units (ICUs). However, there is also increasing concern that the NPIs in place would increase mortality because of other diseases, increase the frequency of suicide and increase the risk of an economic recession with unforeseeable implications. It is therefore instrumental to evaluate the necessity of NPIs and to monitor the progress of containment of the virus spreading. We used a data-driven estimation of the evolution of the reproduction number for viral spreading in Germany as well as in all its federal states. Based on an extended infection-epidemic model, parameterized with data from the Robert Koch-Institute and, alternatively, with parameters stemming from a fit to the initial phase of CoV spreading in different regions of Italy, we consistently found that the reproduction number was turned down to a range near 1 in all federal states. We used the latest reproduction number as a starting point for the simulation of epidemic progression and varied the reproduction number, mimicking either release or strengthening of NPIs. Germany is currently, April 3rd, 2020, at the border line of a reproduction number between the scenarios of major immunisation of the population or eradication of the virus. We strongly recommend to keep all NPIs in place and suggest to even strengthen the measures in order to accelerate reaching the state of full control, thus, also limiting collateral damage of the NPIs in time.","output":"Estimate of the development of the epidemic reproduction number Rt from Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 case data and implications for political measures based on prognostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from a tertiary public hospital in Singapore revealed that multisusceptible strains had gradually started to replace the endemic multiresistant strain (ST239-MRSA-III) since 2002.

This study aims to assess diffusion patterns of outdoor SFPs at sports clubs in the Netherlands. METHODS Using a retrospective, registry-based design, an inventory was made of football, field hockey, tennis and korfball clubs that became smoke free between 2016 and 2020. We determined the type of sports, number of members and proportion of youth members. The degree of urbanisation and density of smoke-free sports clubs were measured at the municipality level. The association between sports clubs' characteristics, degree of urbanisation and SFP adoption was analysed using multilevel regression analysis. Horizontal diffusion was tested by analysing the association between the density and annual incidence of smoke-free sports clubs. RESULTS Since 2016, the number of sports clubs with an outdoor SFP increased from 0.3% to 26.4%. Field hockey and korfball clubs and clubs with many (youth) members were more likely to be smoke-free. SFPs spread from the most urbanised to less urbanised municipalities, which could mostly be attributed to sports clubs' characteristics. A higher density of smoke-free sports clubs within municipalities was associated with an increased incidence of new SFPs in the following year. CONCLUSION Outdoor SFPs at sports clubs in the Netherlands diffused across horizontal and hierarchical lines. National strategies for smoke-free sports should monitor clubs that are more likely to stay behind, such as football and tennis clubs, smaller clubs and clubs in less urbanised areas.","output":"Diffusion of smoke-free policies at outdoor sports clubs in the Netherlands."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early August, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Israel disbursed one-time, universal grants to its citizens, of $220 per adult and $150 per child.

Based on the structural analysis, we propose SPACA6 is a founding member of a superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins, herein dubbed the IST superfamily. The IST superfamily is defined structurally by its distorted four-helix bundle and a pair of disulfide-bonded CXXC motifs. A structure-based search of the AlphaFold human proteome identified more protein members to this superfamily; remarkably, many of these proteins are linked to gamete fusion.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected via an internet-based survey in the spring of 2020 from an online sample of noninstitutionalized adults in the United States (N = 2,045). More than half of the sample self-identified as being in an intimate relationship at the time of the study (58.2%, n = 1,183) and were used in the analysis. A four-item tool was used to assess IPV perpetration and victimization during the earliest stage of the pandemic. Respondents self-reported demographic data and recent health histories, including COVID-19 tests results, related symptoms, and degree of personal social distancing. We hypothesized that COVID-19 related factors would increase risks of IPV. Descriptive, correlational, and generalized linear modeling analysis techniques were employed. RESULTS: COVID-19 impacted respondents had an increased risk of IPV victimization and perpetration. Among those who reported having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but were denied access to testing, the odds of being a victim of psychological IPV was three times more likely than those who did not have symptoms. Respondents who reported testing positive to COVID-19 were two to three times more likely to experience or perpetrate psychological and physical IPV against an intimate partner. People who lost their job due to the pandemic were three to four times more likely to perpetrate IPV compared to those who remained employed. CONCLUSIONS: Especially during this COVID-19 pandemic period, our results emphasize the need for an ongoing public-health response to IPV. Continued surveillance via effective screening, intervention development, and implementation is needed.","output":"Intimate Partner Violence Victimization and Perpetration Among U.S. Adults During the Earliest Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tigernut or chufa (Cyperus esculentus L. var. sativus) is gaining popularity in the United States as a high energy tuber crop known for sweet and chewy taste, 40C45% gluten-free digestible carbohydrate, high dietary fiber content, healthful fatty acid profile (73% monounsaturated, 18% saturated, 9% polyunsaturatedsimilar to olive oil), high oleic acid, and high P, K, and vitamins C. E. Tigernut tubers were obtained from specialty crop markets in central NJ and purchased online from commercial distributors as propagules for transplants for hoop house and field production studies. Nine tigernut selections were also evaluated under NJ hoop house culture conditions for growth habit and in the field for adaptation and productivity We concluded that tigernut production is feasible in NJ based on the results of these experiments. The growth patterns of three selections (GH, MV and SK) were studied and characterized. Foliage growth was similar in the three selections. Plant height ranged from an average of 90 cm in GH to 110 cm in MV and SK; side shoot production capacity ranged from 13 shoots per propagule in GH to 20 or more in MV and SK over 14 weeks. Over 99% of tubers in MV and SK were located within the upper 5 cm of the growth media (Pro-Mix BX brand) but tubers of GH were observed at greater soil depths (~20 cm). Tubers varied from spherical (round) in shape in GH and SK to oblong (elongated) in MV. In the field the best growth and tuber yields from NG3 and T-USA selections were obtained under black or white-over-black plastic mulch in conventionally managed plots. Tubers showed high levels of Fe (168C218 ppm) and Zn (39C50 ppm) implying that they should be a good source of these essential elements in human diet.

Coronavirus replication occurs through a unique mechanism employing Leader sequence in the transcripts when initiating transcription from the genome. Therefore, we cloned the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV(BJ01), which is identical to that identified from SARS-CoV(HKU-39849), and constructed specific siRNA targeting the Leader sequence. Using EGFP and RFP reporter genes fused with the cloned SARS-CoV Leader sequence, we demonstrated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence decreased the mRNA abundance and protein expression levels of the reporter genes in 293T cells. By stably expressing the siRNA in Vero E6 cells, we provided data that the siRNA could effectively and specifically decrease the mRNA abundance of SARS-CoV genes as analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blot. Our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells by silencing gene expression. We further demonstrated, via transient transfection experiments, that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence had a much stronger inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication than the siRNAs targeting the Spike gene or the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides did.

Abstract Dialysis patients are a risk group for SARS-CoV2 infection and possibly further complications, but we have little information. The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID19 (almost 1000 patients in 100000 h). In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit. We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV2 PCR testing. Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% <95% O2 saturation. Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died. We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport. In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-Cov2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases. Conclusions: We detected a high prevalence of COVID19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic. Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%. In terms of staff, 20% have required sick leave in relation to COVID19.","output":"Alta prevalencia de covid19 asintomtico en hemodilisis.

In this work, we aimed at testing whether clinical care changes imposed by the quarantine, together with certain demographic and disease-specific features, might have determined a self-perceived worsening of health status in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: A brief web-based questionnaire investigating self-perceived anxiety, depression, and motor worsening, as well as clinical care changes over COVID-19 emergency, was administered to ALS patients currently followed at San Martino Hospital. Ordinal and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify significant predictors of health status. RESULTS: Fifty-seven ALS patients completed the questionnaire. A total of 35.08% of cases reported anxiety symptoms, 36.84% depressive symptoms, and 35.08% reported worsening of motor symptoms. Significant predictors of anxiety symptoms severity included female gender, greater motor impairment, more aggressive disease course, and rehabilitation therapy suspension. The only significant predictor of depressive symptoms severity was a more aggressive disease course. Significant predictors of motor worsening were shorter disease duration and exams/visits cancelation. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 emergency and its management exerted a significant impact on self-perceived health status in patients with ALS, particularly in those cases in the earliest disease phases and with a more aggressive disease course.

Less common symptoms include: dyspnea, cough, arrhythmias, jaundice, peripheral edema, rashes, albinism and diarrhea. The picture of the disease seen in laboratory tests consists of: duopenia, hypofibrinogenemia (<150 mg/dL) high D-dimers level, and hyperferritinemia. Other abnormalities include hypertriglyceridemia, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia. Diagnostics include: laboratory tests, histopathological examination, lumbar puncture, radiological imaging, functional test and genetic checking. It is important to rule out factors mimicking HLH. Some of the old, well-known criteria are of less relevance nowadays. The aim of the therapy is immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory and anti-cytokine treatment, using the HLH-2004 protocol. In secondary HLH, elimination of the causative agent is critical. In primary HLH, or relapse of secondary forms, allogeneic transplantation is the only curative treatment.

One of the most severe manifestations of invasive candidiasis is candidaemia, whose epidemiology has evolved to more resistant non-albicans Candida species, such as C. auris. It is crucial to establish infection control policies in order to control an outbreak due to nosocomial pathogens, including the implementation of screening colonisation studies. We describe here our experience in managing a C. auris outbreak lasting more than two and a half years which, despite our efforts in establishing control measures and surveillance, is still ongoing. A total of 287 colonised patients and 47 blood stream infections (candidaemia) have been detected to date. The epidemiology of those patients with candidaemia and the susceptibility of C. auris isolates are also reported. Thirty-five patients with candidaemia (74.5%) were also previously colonised. Forty-three patients (91.5%) were hospitalised (61.7%) or had been hospitalised (29.8%) in the ICU before developing candidaemia. Antifungal therapy for candidaemia consisted of echinocandins in monotherapy or in combination with amphotericin B or isavuconazole. The most common underlying disease was abdominal surgery (29.8%). The thirty-day mortality rate was 23.4% and two cases of endophtalmitis due to C. auris were found. All isolates were resistant to fluconazole and susceptible to echinocandins and amphotericin B. One isolate became resistant to echinocandins two months after the first isolate.

As a result, age-stratified modeling for COVID-19 dynamics is the key to study how to reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19. By taking advantage of network theory, we develop an age-stratified epidemic model for COVID-19 in complex contact networks. Specifically, we present an extension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compartmental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR (susceptible-exposedasymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, to capture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with general degree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e., adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality and hospitalizations.

In this study, we investigated the effects of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) on influenza virus (IV)-induced F-actin restructuring and ERM phosphorylation regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase 1 (ROCK), p38 MAPK, and PKC signaling pathways in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Methods Serum containing XDY (XDY-CS; 13.8 g/kg) was acquired using standard protocols for serum pharmacology. Primary PMVECs were obtained from male Wistar rats and cultured. After adsorption of IV A (multiplicity of infection, 0.01) for 1 h, medium with 20% XDY-CS was added to the PMVECs. The distributions of F-actin and phosphorylated ERM were determined by confocal microscopy, and F-actin expression was measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of ROCK1, phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target-subunit (p-MYPT), phosphorylated MAPK kinase, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated PKC (p-PKC), and phosphorylated ERM (p-ERM) were determined by western blotting. Results F-actin reorganization in IV-infected PMVECs was reversed by XDY-CS treatment, which was accompanied by reduced p-ERM production. The p-ERM protein accumulated at plasma membrane of PMVECs infected with IV, which was also inhibited by XDY-CS treatment. In addition, XDY-CS treatment drastically reduced the levels of p-p38, ROCK1, p-MYPT, and p-PKC induced by IV infection in PMVECs. Conclusion These results show that XDY-CS inhibited influenza-induced F-actin reorganization in PMVECs by down-regulating p-ERM expression via inhibition of the Rho/ROCK, p38 MAPK, and PKC pathways. In conclusion, XDY could reduce the damage to endothelial cytoskeleton induced by IV infection, thus protecting the barriers of PMVECs.","output":"Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder reverses influenza virus-induced F-actin reorganization in PMVECs by inhibiting ERM phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal social interactions are the outcomes of evolved strategies that integrate the costs and benefits of being sociable. Using a novel mechanistic, evolutionary, individual-based simulation model, we examine how animals balance the risk of pathogen transmission against the benefits of social information about resource patches, and how this determines the emergent structure of socio-spatial networks. We study a scenario in which a fitness-reducing infectious pathogen is introduced into a population which has initially evolved movement strategies in its absence. Within only a few generations, pathogen introduction provokes a rapid evolutionary shift in animals social movement strategies, and the importance of social cues in movement decisions increases. Individuals undertake a dynamic social distancing approach, trading more movement (and less intake) for lower infection risk. Pathogen-adapted populations disperse more widely over the landscape, and thus have less clustered social networks than their pre-introduction, pathogen-naive ancestors. Running epidemiological simulations on these emergent social networks, we show that diseases do indeed spread more slowly through pathogen-adapted animal societies. Finally, the mix of post-introduction strategies is strongly influenced by a combination of landscape productivity, the usefulness of social information, and disease cost. Our model suggests that the introduction of an infectious pathogen into a population can trigger a rapid eco-evolutionary cascade, rapidly changing animals social movement strategies, which alters movement decisions and encounters between individuals. In turn, this changes emergent social structures, and our model informs how such change can make populations more resilient to future disease outbreaks. Overall, we offer both a modelling framework and initial predictions for the evolutionary and ecological consequences of wildlife pathogen spillover scenarios.","output":"Novel pathogen introduction rapidly alters evolved movement strategies, restructuring animal societies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Assessment of visual-coronary artery calcification on non-cardiac gated CT in COVID-19 patients could provide an objective approach to rapidly identify and triage clinically severe patients for early hospital admission to avert worse prognosis. PURPOSE: To ascertain the role of semi-quantitative scoring in visual-coronary artery calcification score (V-CACS) for predicting the clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval this study included 67 COVID-19 confirmed patients who underwent non-cardiac gated CT chest in an inpatient setting. Two blinded radiologist (Radiologist-1 &2) assessed the V-CACS, CT Chest severity score (CT-SS). The clinical data including the requirement for oxygen support, assisted ventilation, ICU admission and outcome was assessed, and patients were clinically subdivided depending on clinical severity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. ROC curves analysis is performed for the assessment of performance and Pearson correlation were performed to looks for the associations. RESULTS: V-CACS cut off value of 3 (82.67% sensitivity and 54.55% specificity; AUC 0.75) and CT-SS with a cut off value of 21.5 (95.7% sensitivity and 63.6% specificity; AUC 0.87) are independent predictors for clinical severity and also the need for ICU admission or assisted ventilation. The pooling of both CT-SS and V-CACS (82.67% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity; AUC 0.92) are more reliable in terms of predicting the primary outcome of COVID-19 patients. On regression analysis, V-CACS and CT-SS are individual independent predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 (Odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.99-2.98; p = 0.05 and Odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39; p = 0.001 respectively). The area under the curve (AUC) for pooled V-CACS and CT-SS was 0.96 (95% CI 0.84-0.98) which correctly predicted 82.1% cases.

The recent emergence of several genetically distinct descendants known as variants of concern (VOCs) is further challenging public health disease management, due to increased rates of virus transmission and potential constraints on vaccine effectiveness. We report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs imported into Australia belonging to the B.1.351 lineage, first described in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), and the B.1.1.7 lineage originally reported in the United Kingdom, and directly compare the replication kinetics of these two VOCs in Vero E6 cells. In this analysis, we also investigated a B.1.1.7 VOC (QLD1516/2021) carrying a 7-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame 7a (ORF7a) gene, likely truncating and rendering the ORF7a protein of this virus defective. We demonstrate that the replication of the B.1.351 VOC (QLD1520/2020) in Vero E6 cells can be detected earlier than the B.1.1.7 VOCs (QLD1516/2021 and QLD1517/2021), before peaking at 48 h post infection (p.i.), with significantly higher levels of virus progeny. Whilst replication of the ORF7a defective isolate QLD1516/2021 was delayed longer than the other viruses, slightly more viral progeny was produced by the mutant compared to the unmutated isolate QLD1517/2021 at 72 h p.i.

The number of infections was also matched with hospital records. OBSERVATION Out of 36 HCWs, all had received both doses of covishield vaccine. Males were 18 and females were 18, mean age was found to ne 32.17. People with co-morbidities were 13.9% including diabetes and hypertension.

There was no significant difference between hospitalized and non-hospitalized with regard to routine lab parameters, but there significant elevation of inflammatory marker -CRP being positive in 2 hospitalized cases, with p value being significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION This study identifies that breakthrough infections among vaccinated HCWs(health care workers) were common. Most breakthrough infections were mild or asymptomatic, although persistent symptoms did occur. The findings suggested that COVID-19 were more severe in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized and even though infections did occur none resulted in any severe form or mortality, it also indicates that vaccination prevents from severe form of the disease.

When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement. Continuous nebulizer needs to be placed at the inlet of humidifier.","output":"In vitro comparison between inspiration synchronized and continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer during trans-nasal aerosol delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: On December 31, 2019, a type of pneumonia with unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, China. It was named as coronavirus disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. Several studies showed that the outbreaks of infectious diseases affect the emergency department visits. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the epidemiological characteristics of patients visiting the emergency department during the coronavirus disease outbreak. Method: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the three tertiary emergency departments. To evaluate the general characteristics of patients visiting the emergency department, data on sex, age, date and time of visit, initial blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, level of consciousness, and disposition upon discharge were collected. Results: A total of 180,192 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 52,245 patients who visited the emergency department during the coronavirus disease outbreak (December 2019CApril 2020). This number was significantly reduced compared with the 64,405 and 63,542 patients who visited during the pre-coronavirus disease period. During the period of coronavirus disease outbreak, the proportion of alert patients began to decline from February to April. Also, the proportions of patients with Korean Triage and Acuity scores 4C5 and discharged patients decreased during the same period. The number of patients who were diagnosed with influenza because of identified seasonal influenza virus decreased to 1,507 (2.9%), compared with the 2,131 (3.4%) and 2,157 (3.3%) patients diagnosed with this condition during the pre-coronavirus disease period.

Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Mareks disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Mareks disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the two class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Mareks disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only four viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2, the dominantly-expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2 linked to several MDV peptides, and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to core binding peptide of ten amino acids, compared to the nine amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.","output":"Differential host response to a herpesvirus: Mareks disease virus peptides on chicken MHC class II molecules are derived from only a few genes and illustrate a new mode of peptide binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although outcomes for older adults undergoing elective surgery are generally comparable to younger patients, outcomes associated with emergency surgery are poor. These adverse outcomes are in part because of the physiologic changes associated with aging, increased odds of comorbidities in older adults, and a lower probability of presenting with classic \\"red flag\\" physical examination findings. Existing evidence-based perioperative best practice guidelines perform better for elective compared with emergency surgery; so, decision making for older adults undergoing emergency surgery can be challenging for surgeons and other clinicians and may rely on subjective experience. To aid surgical decision making, clinicians should assess premorbid functional status, evaluate for the presence of geriatric syndromes, and consider social determinants of health. Documentation of care preferences and a surrogate decision maker are critical. In discussing the risks and benefits of surgery, patient-centered narrative formats with inclusion of geriatric-specific outcomes are important. Use of risk calculators can be meaningful, although limitations exist. After surgery, daily evaluation for common postoperative complications should be considered, as well as early discharge planning and palliative care consultation, if appropriate. The role of the geriatrician in emergency surgery for older adults may vary based on the acuity of patient presentation, but perioperative consultation and comanagement are strongly recommended to optimize care delivery and patient outcomes.","output":"Applying Evidence-based Principles to Guide Emergency Surgery in Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent national data are lacking on the prevalence, safety, and prescribers of opioid prescriptions dispensed to children and young adults aged 0 to 21 years. METHODS: We identified opioid prescriptions dispensed to children and young adults in 2019 in the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database, which captures 92% of US pharmacies. We calculated the proportion of all US children and young adults with &#8805;1 dispensed opioid prescription in 2019. We calculated performance on 6 metrics of high-risk prescribing and the proportion of prescriptions written by each specialty. Of all prescriptions and those classified as high risk by &#8805;1 metric, we calculated the proportion written by high-volume prescribers with prescription counts at the &#8805;95th percentile. RESULTS: Analyses included 4 027 701 prescriptions. In 2019, 3.5% of US children and young adults had &#8805;1 dispensed opioid prescription. Of prescriptions for opioid-naive patients, 41.8% and 3.8% exceeded a 3-day and 7-day supply, respectively. Of prescriptions for young children, 8.4% and 7.7% were for codeine and tramadol. Of prescriptions for adolescents and young adults, 11.5% had daily dosages of &#8805;50 morphine milligram equivalents; 4.6% had benzodiazepine overlap. Overall, 45.6% of prescriptions were high risk by &#8805;1 metric. Dentists and surgeons wrote 61.4% of prescriptions. High-volume prescribers wrote 53.3% of prescriptions and 53.1% of high-risk prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of pediatric opioid prescriptions are high risk. To reduce high-risk prescribing, initiatives targeting high-volume prescribers may be warranted.

For over two months of stay-at-home orders, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures have had on mental health and well-being. We conducted a large web-based survey on 8177 students from a university institute in Milan, Northern Italy, one of the regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. As emerged from our analysis, poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments <60 m2 with poor views and scarce indoor quality is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95% CI: 1046-1637), 1.368 (95% CI: 1166-1605), and 2.253 (95% CI: 1918-2647) times the risk of moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 3713-4924).

Neonates with respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may pose a risk to healthcare workers. International guidelines differ on methods to minimize the risk due to limited data. OBJECTIVE We examined the expiratory airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation AGMPs using infant simulators. METHODS Expiratory airflow dispersion in term and preterm manikins was simulated (n = 288) using fine particle smoke at tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg. Using ImageJ, we quantified dispersion during common airway procedures including endotracheal tube (ETT) and T-piece ventilation. RESULTS Maximal expiratory dispersion distances for the unsupported airway and disconnected uncuffed ETT scenarios were 30.2 and 22.7 cm (term); 22.1 and 17.2 cm (preterm), respectively. Applying T-piece positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) via an ETT (ETTPEEP ) generated no expiratory dispersion but increased tube leak during term simulation, while ventilation breaths (ETTVENT ) caused significant expiratory dispersion and leak. There was no measurable dispersion during face mask ventilation. For term uncuffed ETT ventilation, the particle filter eliminated expiratory dispersion but increased leak. No expiratory dispersion and negligible leak were observed when combining a cuffed ETT and filter. Angulated T-pieces generated the greatest median dispersion distances of 35.8 cm (ETTPEEP ) and 23.3 cm (ETTVENT ). CONCLUSIONS Airflow dispersion during neonatal AGMPs is greater than previously postulated and potentially could contaminate healthcare providers during resuscitation of infants infected with contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. It is possible to mitigate this risk using particle filters and cuffed ETTs. Applicability in the clinical setting requires further evaluation.","output":"Airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation procedures: A simulation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, dental care providers, including special care dentistry (SCD) services, had to face an extraordinary change of their standard operating procedures (SOP), with deferred domiciliary dental care, withholding conscious dental sedation services and disrupted routine care [ ]","output":"Getting Special Care Dentistry Ready for a Foreseeable Future.

Since ELISpots performed with antigen-derived peptides offer a universal assay format, method performance characteristics were validated using widely available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) responsive to cytomegalovirus peptides. The limit of detection and confirmatory cut point were established using statistical methods; precision, specificity, and linearity were confirmed. Monkey PBMCs from an AAV5 gene therapy study were then analyzed, using peptide pools spanning the vector capsid and transgene product. AAV5-specific T cell responses were detected only in 2 of 18 monkeys at Day 28, but not at Day 13 and 56 after vector administration, with no correlation to liver enzyme elevations or transgene expression levels. No transgene product-specific T cell responses occurred. In conclusion, while viral peptide-specific IFN- ELISpots can be successfully validated for monkey PBMCs, monitoring peripheral T cell responses in non-clinical AAV5 gene therapy studies was of limited value to interpret safety or efficacy.","output":"Validation of an IFN-gamma ELISpot assay to measure cellular immune responses against viral antigens in non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To evaluate the survival rate of mini implants used to retain mandibular overdentures.

LSAS is a relatively safe industrial byproduct with similar polyanionic characteristics to that of heparin. Human plasma clotting assays, fibrin polymerization testing, and enzyme inhibition assays were exploited to investigate the anticoagulant activity of LSAS. In normal human plasma, LSAS selectively doubled the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at ~308 g/mL. Equally, LSAS doubled APTT at ~275 g/mL in antithrombin-deficient plasma. Yet, LSAS doubled APTT at a higher concentration of 429 g/mL using factor XI-deficient plasma. LSAS did not affect FXIIIa-mediated fibrin polymerization at 1000 g/mL. Enzyme assays revealed that LSAS inhibits factor XIa (FXIa) with an IC(50) value of ~8 g/mL. LSAS did not inhibit thrombin, factor IXa, factor Xa, factor XIIIa, chymotrypsin, or trypsin at the highest concentrations tested and demonstrated significant selectivity against factor XIIa and plasmin. In MichaelisCMenten kinetics, LSAS decreased the V(MAX) of FXIa hydrolysis of a tripeptide chromogenic substrate without significantly changing its K(M) indicating an allosteric inhibition mechanism. The inhibitor also disrupted the generation of FXIaCantithrombin complex, inhibited factor XIIa-mediated and thrombin-mediated activation of the zymogen factor XI to FXIa, and competed with heparin for binding to FXIa. Its action appears to be reversed by protamine sulfate. StructureCactivity relationship studies demonstrated the advantageous selectivity and allosteric behavior of LSAS over the acetylated and desulfonated derivatives of LSAS. LSAS is a sulfonated heparin mimetic that demonstrates significant anticoagulant activity in human plasma. Overall, it appears that LSAS is a potent, selective, and allosteric inhibitor of FXIa with significant anticoagulant activity in human plasma. Altogether, this study introduces LSAS as a promising lead for further development as an anticoagulant.","output":"Lignosulfonic Acid Sodium Is a Noncompetitive Inhibitor of Human Factor XIa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been exerting negative effects on several economies in 2020 Therefore, it is of paramount importance to examine the impact of this pandemic on the global banking stability and to assess any potential recovery signals This study is timely, in that we consider 1090 banks from 116 countries for quarterly periods across 2019C20 The results provide strong empirical evidence that, in the global banking sector, the Covid-19 outbreak has had detrimental impacts on financial performance across various indicators of financial performance (i e , accounting-based and market-based performance measures) and financial stability (i e , high-risk indicators including default risk, liquidity risk and asset risk) These results are consistently observed for various regions, countries (US, China and others), and different bank-level characterises, and across income-generation levels among countries We also find differential effects of the pandemic on alternative banking systems (i e , conventional and Islamic) Moreover, our trend analysis, based on bank average performance and financial stability over quarterly periods, identifies a signal of recovery for bank stability during the second quarter of 2020 The findings presented in this study offer important financial observations and policy implications to many stakeholders engaging with global banking","output":"Global Banking Stability in the Shadow of Covid-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study estimates cumulative infection rates from Covid-19 in Great Britain by local authority districts (LADs) and council areas (CAs) and investigates spatial patterns in infection rates We propose a model-based approach to calculate cumulative infection rates from data on observed and expected deaths from Covid-19 Our analysis of mortality data shows that 7% of people in Great Britain were infected by Covid-19 by the last third of June 2020 It is unlikely that the infection rate was lower than 4% or higher than 15% Secondly, England had higher infection rates than Scotland and especially Wales, although the differences between countries were not large Thirdly, we observed a substantial variation in virus infection rates in Great Britain by geographical units Estimated infection rates were highest in the capital city of London where between 11 and 12% of the population might have been infected and also in other major urban regions, while the lowest were in small towns and rural areas Finally, spatial regression analysis showed that the virus infection rates increased with the increasing population density of the area and the level of deprivation The results suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups in urban areas (including those with minority backgrounds) were most affected by the spread of coronavirus from March to June","output":"Infection rates from Covid-19 in Great Britain by geographical units: A model-based estimation from mortality data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the impact of stock liquidity on firm value in the time of COVID-19 pandemic Using data from A-share listed companies in China, we calculate the firm value of Cumulative Abnormal Returns through the event study method and stock liquidity by the Amihud illiquidity We find that significant negative relationships between stock liquidity and firm value exist in the first three days of the COVID-19 outbreak, while significant positive relationships in the following days We also find that these negative relationships are more significant in severely impacted regions, small companies, and non-state-owned enterprises","output":"Stock Liquidity and Firm Value in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The microbiome like any other components of the body undergoes numerous challenges during the life-span of a human being.

Background and aim: In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, took place in Wuhan and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Methods: This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. Results: We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 36.6%. 56.1% of patients presented with sever pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. 48.8% of patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Median length of stay was 12 days (interquartilic range 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase-LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent intensive care unit-ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and RRT requirement. Conclusions: Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers as well as individualized fluid management can play a key role in AKI prevention.","output":"FRACASO RENAL AGUDO EN PACIENTES HOSPITALIZADOS POR COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic arrangements are changing accordingly, with seniors moving in with their adult children or their siblings or unrelated caregivers.

University hospitals and patients will benefit from recent advancements in medicine in term of diagnostic and treatment. Importantly, research is bringing satisfaction, dynamism and opportunity for doctors to leave a legacy for the next generations of doctors in Sudan. During the pandemic of COVID-19, it is clear that more research is needed in Sudan. Importantly, diabetes, obesity and hypertension are known to have a high prevalence in Sudan and also risk factors for COVID-19. This is a challenging time for the health system in Sudan, and perhaps investing in research will help in keeping people well and open new venues for health service in Sudan. We very much hope that this article will increase understanding and enthusiasm about research in communicable, non-communicable diseases, medical education and social medicine. Therefore, we feel that every doctor in Sudan should engage in research activities so that current and future patients can benefit from the outcomes of these research activities. ?

Tourists travel is driven by several motivational factors, which lead them to plan or continue on a travel trip. However, since the emergence of COVID-19, travelling has become a major issue for the whole travel industry. The recent spread of Omicron makes most post-pandemic studies futile. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of motivation factors that affect tourists travel intention in the controlled pandemic context. The mediating role of perceived value and the moderating role of perceived travel risk were examined as well. The Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory was adopted as the theoretical foundation of the research framework. A quantitative online survey was used to collect data from 388 Malaysian and Taiwanese travelers. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse the data. The results show that escape, kinship, and people are direct and indirect motivation factors that influence tourists intention to travel via perceived value. Notably travel risk indicated no moderating effect. The results of this study provide useful insights into tourists post-pandemic behaviour that offer practical implications for Asian business. ? 2021, Asia Business Research Corporation.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is well defined, but efficacious treatment is lacking. There is a big gap in knowledge regarding COVID-19 patients receiving convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT), especially those also suffering from diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, among 3,059 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital of China, we documented the characteristics of 39 COVID-19 patients with DM receiving CPT, and compared their baseline information and clinical outcomes to COVID-19 patients with DM receiving conventional treatment. We also performed the propensity-matched comparison of COVID-19 patients with DM between conventional treatment and CPT. The CPT was efficacious and beneficial for COVID-19 patients with DM, including severe or critical ill patients, without obvious adverse effects. Our data demonstrated that CPT significantly improved the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM, especially the cure rate and duration of hospitalization compared with that in COVID-19 patients with DM receiving conventional treatment. This study not only provided a deeper understanding of characteristics in COVID-19 patients with DM receiving CPT, but also highlighted the efficacious of CPT for COVID-19 patients with DM.

Among these methods, adjusting the original nowcasts and forecasts by an amount similar to the nowcast and forecast errors made during the financial crisis and subsequent recovery seems to produce the best results for the US, notwithstanding the different source and characteristics of the financial crisis. In particular, the adjusted growth nowcasts for 2020Q1 get closer to the actual value, and the adjusted forecasts based on alternative indicators become much more similar, all unfortunately indicating a much slower recovery than without adjustment, and very persistent negative effects on trend growth.

The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, induced by aging stress, mediates mitophagy and cell death; however, the aging-related roles of ceramide metabolism in regulating T cell function remain unknown. Here, we show that activated T cells isolated from aging mice have elevated C14/C16 ceramide accumulation in mitochondria, generated by ceramide synthase 6, leading to mitophagy/mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, aging-dependent mitochondrial ceramide inhibits protein kinase A, leading to mitophagy in activated T cells. This aging/ceramide-dependent mitophagy attenuates the antitumor functions of T cells in vitro and in vivo. Also, inhibition of ceramide metabolism or PKA activation by genetic and pharmacologic means prevents mitophagy and restores the central memory phenotype in aging T cells. Thus, these studies help explain the mechanisms behind aging-related dysregulation of T cells antitumor activity, which can be restored by inhibiting ceramide-dependent mitophagy.","output":"Aging-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by ceramide signaling inhibits antitumor T cell response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 presents as symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease in susceptible patients. Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","output":"Invasive and noninvasive ventilation strategies for acute respiratory failure in children with coronavirus disease 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disaster preparedness is a major but necessary undertaking for every health care facility. The 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) provided an unforeseen opportunity to compare the response of two radiology departments, University Health System A (UHSA) and University Health System B (UHSAB). Preparing for this disaster was unique since though unexpected, was thought to be detected early enough to allow for sufficient preparation. Unlike many other disasters which are short-term, single events, this has been an on-going event. Changes at both health systems included workflow alterations for exposure reduction to faculty, trainees, and staff. UHSA was able to quickly divert workflow to previously deployed home workstations, while University of Utah Health Sciences Center required 2 to 3 weeks to procure and initialize enough remote workstations to significantly affect departmental operations. Other measures such as universal masking, temperature screening at facility entrances, virtual appointments, and physical barriers were used by both systems to limit patient-to-patient, patient-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and staff-staff physical interaction to help decrease exposure risk. The goal of these preparations is to allow each department to fulfill imaging needs in support of the organizational clinical mission with the flexibility to adapt to the unique and dynamic nature of this disaster.","output":"The Role of Imaging Informatics in Disaster Preparedness During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein family plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. In this work, a set of small molecules were identified as Cdc25 modulators by applying a mixed ligand-structure-based approach and taking advantage of the correlation between the chemosensitivity of selected structures and the protein expression pattern of the proposed target. In the first step of the in silico protocol, a set of molecules acting as Cdc25 inhibitors were identified through a new ligand-based protocol and the evaluation of a large database of molecular structures. Subsequently, induced-fit docking (IFD) studies allowed us to further reduce the number of compounds biologically screened. In vitro antiproliferative and enzymatic inhibition assays on the selected compounds led to the identification of new structurally heterogeneous inhibitors of Cdc25 proteins. Among them, J3955, the most active inhibitor, showed concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells, with GI(50) in the low micromolar range. When J3955 was tested in cell-cycle perturbation experiments, it caused mitotic failure by G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Finally, Western blotting analysis showed an increment of phosphorylated Cdk1 levels in cells exposed to J3955, indicating its specific influence in cellular pathways involving Cdc25 proteins.","output":"In Silico Identification of Small Molecules as New Cdc25 Inhibitors through the Correlation between Chemosensitivity and Protein Expression Pattern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shelter in place orders (SIPOs) require residents to remain home for all but essential activities.

ABTRACT Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if tobacco use in patients with Covid-19 is associated with a negative disease course and adverse outcome, and if smoking, current and past, is associated with a greater possibility of developing COVID-19. Material and Methods: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of previously published works were performed. The search strategy included all known descriptors for Covid-19 and tobacco and was conducted in different databases. Appropriate statistical models were used to address the effect size in meta-analysis, namely random effects and fixed effects model. Results: Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress.

On the one hand, there are the unspecific, non-adaptive immune reactions, which recognize and eliminate invading foreign pathogens. This so-called natural or innate immune system becomes primarily active after a virus has overcome the external physical protection barriers of the body (skin, mucous membranes). It consists of dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells). They have proteins that serve as receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and complement receptors, for specific structures of pathogens and for the soluble products of the innate immune system (acute-phase proteins, factors of the complement system, cytokines, chemokines and interferons). The effects and functions of cytokines, chemokines and interferons will be discussed separately in Chap. 8. The specific, adaptive immune response is the second line of defence, and is developed only during or after the establishment of an infection. It includes antibody-producing B cells C the humoral immune system C as well as T-helper (T(H)) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which collectively constitute the cellular defence system. The adaptive immune reactions can selectively recognize certain pathogen types or subtypes, and in the case of a reinfection, they are able to recognize the pathogens again and eliminate them. They are long-lasting and a subset of stimulated lymphocytes transform into memory cells during their development, which confers on the organism an efficient protective immunity against infections with the same pathogen. The systems of the specific and non-specific immune responses are in close contact with each other, particularly via cytokines, chemokines and interferons. An immune response is generally triggered by antigens. These may be the infectious pathogens, individual protein components or sugar structures. The immune system recognizes these as foreign, and thus can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous components. However, the antigens must be of a certain size to trigger different immune responses.

One strategy to compensate for information overload is cognitive offloading which refers to the externalization of cognitive processes such as reminder setting instead of memorizing. There appears to be remarkable variance in offloading behavior between participants which poses the question whether there is a common factor influencing offloading behavior across different tasks tackling short-term memory processes. To pursue this question, we studied individual differences in offloading behavior between two well-established offloading paradigms: the intention offloading task which tackles memory for intentions and the pattern copy task which tackles continuous short-term memory load. Our study also included an unrelated task measuring short-term memory capacity. Each participant completed all tasks twice on two consecutive days in order to obtain reliability scores. Despite high reliability scores, individual differences in offloading behavior were uncorrelated between the two offloading tasks. In both tasks, however, individual differences in offloading behavior were correlated with the individual differences in an unrelated short-term memory task. Our results therefore show that offloading behavior cannot simply be explained in terms of a single common factor driving offloading behavior across tasks. We discuss the implications of this finding for future research investigating the interrelations of offloading behavior across different tasks.","output":"Individual differences in cognitive offloading: a comparison of intention offloading, pattern copy, and short-term memory capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we take a step back to distill seven principles out of our experience in the spring of 2020, when our 12-person rapid-response team used skills of data science and beyond to help distribute Covid PPE.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article provides information on the physical principles, an review of the literature, and our first experiences in lung imaging on a modern 0.55 T MRI. CONCLUSION: Low-field MRI (< 1 T) may have technical and economic advantages over higher field strength MRI in lung imaging. The physical preconditions of low-field MRI are advantageous for imaging the lungs due to reduced susceptibility effects, increased transversal relaxation times, and lower specific absorption rates. The lower investment and operating costs may enable increased availability and sustainability. Combining modern sequences and computer-based image processing may expand beyond morphological imaging by providing spatially and temporally resolved functional examinations of the lung parenchyma without ionizing radiation. In critical scenarios, like screening and short-term follow-up examinations, and patients at risk, low-field MRI may bridge the gap.

Key factors influencing these positive results included the presence of an MDT, the access to a patient liaison and knowledge of support groups during the consult, digitized patient information sheets and a cohesive approach between endocrine and fertility teams. Clinician feedback was positive with all members agreeing that the pre and post clinic MDTs allowed effective pinpointing of often missed issues (e.g. hormone induction, social issues). Key milestones for the clinic included the reduction in waiting times by almost 80%, securing funding for costly hormone medication and assisted reproduction, improving sperm retrieval rates (from 11 C 29%) and a thrombo-embolism awareness programme. The overall patient and clinician feedback for the adult KSMDT clinic was uniformly positive, with the multispecialty approach allowing communication with and between all relevant specialities on the same day, avoiding the need to come for multiple separate appointments across different sites (especially relevant during the COVID-19 era). The feedback has also been useful in developing patient information tools such as digital resources and has led to the development of a supportive community group for newly diagnosed KS men. More research is underway to investigate the complex issues affecting KS men long term, after fertility management. Work supported by industry: no.

We previously demonstrated in preclinical models and in human clinical trials that our SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses in na?ve subjects. Here, the objective was to document the potency of various booster vaccine formulations in macaques previously vaccinated with mRNA or protein subunit vaccine candidates. We show that one booster dose of AS03-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM, D614 (parental) or B.1.351 (Beta), in monovalent or bivalent (D614 + B.1.351) formulations, significantly boosted pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and elicited high and stable cross-neutralizing antibodies covering the four known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and, unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-1, in primed macaques. Interestingly, the non-adjuvanted CoV2 preS dTM B.1.351 vaccine formulation also significantly boosted and broadened the neutralizing antibody responses. Our findings show that these vaccine candidates used as a booster have the potential to offer cross-protection against a broad spectrum of variants. This has important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and informs on the benefit of a booster with our vaccine candidates currently under evaluation in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials (NCT04762680 and NCT04904549).","output":"SARS-CoV-2 preS dTM vaccine booster candidates increase functional antibody responses and cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a heartbreaking situation across the globe It is affecting the human population both in terms of health issues and food safety concerns Most of the countries are struggling to save their economies during the lock-down conditions The fight against the COVID-19 is very tough;either one can save the economy or save his country's human population It seems COVID-19 have all the negative impact across the world However, there is also some positive impact of this pandemic, where we observe much reduced environmental pollution There has been significant improvement in the air quality at almost all the places where lock-down is implemented Air pollution directly affects our health and hence the quality of life In India, air quality has improved much beyond our expectations during the lock-down This paper studies the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution in major Indian cities In the air quality rating, the paper considers types of air pollutants like Particulate Matters and Gaseous Components as benchmarks Authors have also used available literature to study the ongoing pollution measurements, impact, and change over time The study analysed available air quality data of four metros, i e , Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, over the four months (National Lockdown) Two particulate matters (PM-2 5 and PM-10) pollution levels are compared with last year's values to identify the significant variations Moreover, Gaseous components are used to analyse their impact on the country's human health and food ecosystem The study analyses the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution, and the general recommendations are given Paper identifies that there is a very good or positive impact of closing polluting units and vehicular movements","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on particulate matter (PM) concentration and harmful gaseous components on Indian metros"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is minimal information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) in immunocompromised individuals.

A2cScheduler consists of two agents, one of which, dubbed the actor, is responsible for learning the scheduling policy automatically and the other one, the critic, reduces the estimation error. Unlike previous policy gradient approaches, A2cScheduler is designed to reduce the gradient estimation variance and to update parameters efficiently.

This study provides the first evidence of aerosol droplet formation from an ultrasonic scalar under simulated oral conditions. State-of-the-art optical flow tracking velocimetry and shadowgraphy measurements are employed to quantitatively measure the flow velocity, trajectories and size distribution of droplets produced during a dental scaling process. The droplet sizes are found to vary from 5 m to 300 m; these correspond to droplet nuclei that could carry viruses. The droplet velocities also vary between 1.3 m s-1 and 2.6 m s-1.

The first protein found to contain ALS-associated mutations was copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which is conformationally stable when it contains its metal ligands and has formed its native intramolecular disulfide. Mutations in SOD1 reduce protein folding stability via disruption of metal binding and/or disulfide formation, resulting in misfolding, aggregation, and ultimately cellular toxicity. A great deal of effort has focused on preventing the misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 as a potential therapy for ALS; however, the results have been mixed. Here, we utilize a small-molecule polytherapy of diacetylbis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (CuATSM) and ebselen to mimic the metal delivery and disulfide bond promoting activity of the cellular chaperone of SOD1, the copper chaperone for SOD1. Using microscopy with automated image analysis, we find that polytherapy using CuATSM and ebselen is highly effective and acts in synergy to reduce inclusion formation in a cell model of SOD1 aggregation for multiple ALS-associated mutants. Polytherapy reduces mutant SOD1-associated cell death, as measured by live-cell microscopy. Measuring dismutase activity via zymography and immunoblotting for disulfide formation showed that polytherapy promoted more effective maturation of transfected SOD1 variants beyond either compound alone. Our data suggest that a polytherapy of CuATSM and ebselen may merit more study as an effective method of treating SOD1-associated ALS.","output":"A copper chaperoneCmimetic polytherapy for SOD1-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Vaccines and drugs for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 require robust evidence generated from clinical trials before they can be used. Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups.

METHODS: Countries reported weekly or monthly all-cause mortality from January 2015 until the end of June or August 2020. Weekly or monthly COVID-19 deaths were reported for 2020. Excess mortality for 2020 was calculated by comparing weekly or monthly 2020 mortality (observed deaths) against a baseline mortality obtained from 2015C2019 data for the same week or month using two methods: (i) difference in observed mortality rates between 2020 and the 2015C2019 average and (ii) difference between observed and expected 2020 deaths. RESULTS: Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK (England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland) and the USA demonstrated excess all-cause mortality, whereas Australia, Denmark and Georgia experienced a decrease in all-cause mortality. Israel, Ukraine and Ireland demonstrated sex-specific changes in all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: All-cause mortality up to August 2020 was higher than in previous years in some, but not all, participating countries.

In South Korea, which had been called the Hepatitis Kingdom, KIM developed a vaccine material for hepatitis B. Through his research achievements, South Korea, emerged from a country ignorant of hepatitis to a country with a hepatitis B vaccine. It is not easy to achieve remarkable results in developing countries where scientific development is lagging. This environment, however, helped KIM achieve his research. This article explains that the two circumstances affected his achievement in his research. First, KIM got a chance to study in the U.S. when he was his starting as a researcher. In the 1960s, the scientific and medical education environment in Korea was still poor. KIM left for Harvard University with the support of CMB, where he was able to advance his studies. This experience was an opportunity to further enhance his research skills. Second, Korea's poor health and hygiene environment in the 1970s worked in favor of verifying the effectiveness of vaccine materials he developed. South Korea, where hepatitis B was prevalent, became a good research site to secure enough test subjects. KIM also used blood sellers to find out the effects of the vaccine material he developed. Blood sellers are people who earn their living by selling their own blood and were commonly found in Korea at that time. The situation in Korea in the 1970s with prevailing hepatitis and the presence of blood sellers played an important role in KIM's research. His research on vaccine development for hepatitis B was hard to imagine in the scientific research environment of South Korea at the time. However, it was also this context and environment of South Korea at the time that enabled his achievement of developing a hepatitis B vaccine.","output":"Finding the key to solving problems in the hepatitis kingdom: A Study on the Development of Hepatitis B Vaccine by Kim Chung Young in the 1960-70s"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies could be labeled with enzymes for use in histochemical staining procedures by enzyme-immunoassay (EIA). The use of EIA is an extension of previously used serological tests, using enzyme-labeled antibody or antigen to determine antibody content. Direct detection of antigen by EIA represents a more dramatic departure from previous methods based on culture. Also, the method has enabled detection of infectious agents that are difficult to cultivate, such as hepatitis A virus and rotavirus, or agents that cannot be cultivated, such as hepatitis B. The use of EIA tests for detection of microbial antigens provides an alternative to culture as a means for direct identification of a specific microbial agent. It also provides a means to detect microbial agents which have not been successfully propagated. The detection of circulating antigen or detection of antigen in other body fluids by EIA is more difficult than detection of antibody because of the sensitivity required, and because of interfering substances in specimens such as feces and respiratory secretions. For this reason, very few antigen detection assays have the sensitivity and specificity required to be used as a primary diagnostic test. The number of tests that have been developed, however, is impressive and because of the possibilities for rapid, specific diagnosis, the interest in antigen detection by EIA remains high.","output":"Enzyme-Linked Immunoassays for the Detection of Microbial Antigens and Their Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, a prophylactic drug is strongly needed to stop the spread of this disease.

Most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-19. OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). PARTICIPANTS: 5,834,543 individuals in care, among whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and May 4, 2020. EXPOSURES: Self-reported race/ethnicity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural residence. RESULTS: Among all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87). CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of Covid-19 not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care.

We propose that the crisis communication purposes of users can be detected to enhance data selection and prioritization for different crisis management tasks. A classification framework was built to identify three facets of a message: content type, audience type, and information source. The definitions of these categories are not dependent on a specific type of crises. So the classification framework can be potentially applied to different crisis scenarios. Machine learning models were created for the automatic classification of messages. Results showed the CNN-based model achieved the best accuracy (88.5%) for the classification of content type. The proposed Naive Bayes and logistic repression with predetermined features can best differentiate audience types and information source with an accuracy of 72.7% and 72.2%, respectively. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Multi-faceted classification for the identification of informative communications during crises: Case of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has required urgent scientific response to investigate the disease, its prevention and treatment and interactions with cardiovascular conditions. Consequently, a centralized workflow was needed to effectively recruit, screen and connect volunteers to COVID-19 research opportunities. Objective: To create a centralized registry to match eligible and interested volunteers 18 years with COVID-19 outpatient research studies at an academic health system. Methods: Key stakeholders, including researchers and participant advocates, collaborated to build the Hopkins Opportunity for Participant Engagement (HOPE) Registry in English and Spanish. REDCap, a secure web-based application, served as the Registry platform. Study teams recruiting for outpatient studies were invited to present their studies through the Registry. Study volunteers were recruited using multiple methods, including patient portal messages, email, social media, and online advertisement. The Registry included COVID testing results and participant survey of demographic and COVID-19 related questions. Branching logic was used to pre-screen and present participating studies for which the person was eligible. The individual then selected which studies, ifany, they were interested in. Study teams received an automatic notification and reached out directlyto individuals expressing interest in their study ( Figure ). Results: The HOPE Registry includes 7 studies and has enrolled 4186 people. Over half (55%)were &gt;55 years and the majority were female (64%). Racial/ethnic groups represented were Whites(80%), Black s (9%), Asians (4.7%), Hispanics (5%), and American Indian (0.3%). Participants were interested in: 29%, treatment study;37%, vaccine study;and 66%, donating plasma. Within 10weeks, 585 persons were matched with an actively recruiting study.

However, SG also has a number of disadvantages and associated risks. We sought to examine perioperative complications and outcomes of laparoscopic SG (LSG) in a single major Canadian bariatric surgery centre (Victoria, BC). METHODS Since June 2008, LSG has been performed at our centre and we reviewed the cases of all patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review in April 2010. RESULTS Thirty-four patients had LSG, and none was lost to follow-up. Indications for LSG over other bariatric procedures were patient preference (n=28), severe obesity with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 60 kg/m(2) (n=5) and severe upper abdominal adhesions (n=1). All but 1 of the cohort were women, and the average age was 48 (standard deviation [SD] 11) years. Preoperatively, the average BMI was 50.3 (SD 7.7) kg/m(2). Preoperative obesity-related comorbidity rates were 56% (n=19) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 50% (n=17) for hypertension, 32% (n=11) for dys lipidemia, 62% (n=21) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 62% (n=21) for knee and/or hip pain and 44% (n=15) for depression and/or anxiety. The mean duration of surgery was 74 (SD 21) minutes. There were 2 major perioperative complications: 1 staple line leak and 1 staple line hemorrhage. The median stay in hospital was 1 day. Postoperative upper gastrointestinal imaging studies were conducted in 11 patients; 1 was positive for staple line leak. Histopathology on the excised gastric segments revealed chronic helicobacter pylori gastritis in 2 patients and small gastrointestinal stromal tumours in 1 patient. The mean postoperative follow-up interval was 10 months. Weight loss averaged 27.4 (SD 9.0) kg. Overall weight loss was 3.3 (SD 1.8) kg/month. Resolution occurred in 74% of patients with T2DM, 53% with hypertension, 45% with dyslipidemia, 76% with OSA, 38% with joint pain and 20% with depression/anxiety. Overall satisfaction was rated as excellent by 68% of patients, good by 29% and poor by 3% of patients. CONCLUSION Preliminary analysis of our experience with LSG indicates that this is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of obesity.","output":"Early results of a Canadian laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continued emergence of novel viruses poses a significant threat to global health. Uncontrolled outbreaks can result in pandemics that have the potential to overburden our healthcare and economic systems. While vaccination is a conventional modality that can be employed to promote herd immunity, antiviral vaccines can only be applied prophylactically and do little to help patients who have already contracted viral infections. During the early stages of a disease outbreak when vaccines are unavailable, therapeutic antiviral drugs can be used as a stopgap solution. However, these treatments do not always work against emerging viral strains and can be accompanied by adverse effects that sometimes outweigh the benefits. Nanotechnology has the potential to overcome many of the challenges facing current antiviral therapies. For example, nanodelivery vehicles can be employed to drastically improve the pharmacokinetic profile of antiviral drugs while reducing their systemic toxicity. Other unique nanomaterials can be leveraged for their virucidal or virus-neutralizing properties. In this review, we discuss recent developments in antiviral nanotherapeutics and provide a perspective on the application of nanotechnology to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and future virus pandemics.","output":"Nanotechnology for virus treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatricians are resources for families to provide ongoing care, education, and guidance during emergencies.

Going online for months surely tests the ability of educators to deliver student centered and interactive learning in a challenging environment. Learner centeredness, in general, implies learning in which the learners responsibilities and activities are emphasized compared to that of the instructors. This does not mean that the educators role is weakened. Professors must be active in providing feedback about misconceptions and confusions to help students grow into experts. They should also clarify the relation between class projects with the course objectives and the real world, and help students with low competencies develop strategies for solving open-ended problems. Students want to think like an expert and apply their skills for solving real world problems. They also desire academic growth by modeling deep insight from their professors. The educators role for providing meaningful guidance has become more critical than ever especially for first or second year students who may need more scaffolding for their intellectual development. However, when online classes are carried out for a prolonged time, students self-regulation subsides, and the yearn for togetherness rises, making it difficult to maintain learner centeredness.

Tourism is crucial for the economies of Spain and China, and both countries have the longest high speed rail (HSR) networks in the world. What role has HSR infrastructure played in the development of tourism in both countries? Little research has been done to date, even in Europe, to estimate empirically how tourism indicators are affected by new HSR lines. In 2012 a multivariate panel analysis by Chen and Haynes was applied to 27 Chinese regions, and confirmed that emerging high speed rail services (during the period 1999C2010) had significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. No similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyse and validate this tool when applied to the Spanish context, and to develop a comparative analysis with the Chinese case study. The methodology is applied to 47 Spanish provinces during the period 1999C2015, and the results clearly reveal a positive but lower-value link (compared to China) between the increase in certain tourism outputs (foreign arrivals and revenues) and HSR network construction. However, further research is needed into the model's limitations, namely the availability of suitable tourism indicators in the official databases, the HSR explanatory variables considered, and the ability to detect circular cause-effects between HSR and tourism.","output":"High speed rail effects on tourism: Spanish empirical evidence derived from China's modelling experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate if obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19. To examine whether the risk for contracting COVID-19 is elevated among OSA patients. Design and setting: Registry based retrospective case-control study using Finnish nationwide health registries and the FinnGen Study cohort. Participants: Information regarding OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection was extracted from the FinnGen study (N=260,405) with a total of 305 patients who had a recorded PCR-validated COVID-19 infection including 26 (8.5%) individuals who were also OSA patients. Severe COVID-19 (N=83, 27.2%) was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. Among the hospitalized individuals there were 16 (19.3%) with OSA diagnosis. In addition, we also included in our analysis previously reported risk factors for both severe COVID-19 or risk factors and comorbidities for OSA from FinnGen. Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease.","output":"Sleep apnoea is a risk factor for severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bike sharing is one of the recent trends in urban areas as a solution for the mobility problem, where it is seen as a significant component of local transportation due to the need to ensure last-mile transportation. Bike sharing systems enable bicycles to be rented at a station for a ride and be dropped off at another station which provides flexibility to users. However, incorporating a bike sharing system into the transportation network of a city involves its own challenges including balancing the supply and demand within stations, and scheduling bikes' repositioning. The bike repositioning scheduling problem arises due to the variable demand for various types of bicycles that can be rented from and left to any station. In order to ensure sustainability in bike sharing operations, bikes should be redistributed to the stations considering the demand, during for example a day or night. In this context, with the ultimate motivation of proposing a bike sharing system to meet within-day demand dynamics in a metropolitan city, we address the Static Bike sharing Rebalancing Problem (SBRP) with multiple capacitated vehicles for redistribution of bicycles. On purpose, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program in which the objective is minimizing the total cost subject to a set of constraints including truck capacity, demand satisfaction, inventory balance, and flow preservation. We have obtained the results from solutions to the SBRP through a real case study discussing the tendency on bike sharing systems before and during Covid-19 pandemic, in which total distance traveled according to the repositioning schemes for different months in a year, repositioning, and the truck type requirements for different days in a week, and the unsatisfied demand concerning the actual demands are analyzed.

METHODS: French pilgrims were recruited between January 2012CDecember 2014 and information on demographics, medical history, compliance with preventive measures and health problems during travel were collected. RESULTS: A total of 382 pilgrims were included with 39.3% aged 65 years and 55.1% suffering from a chronic disease, most frequently hypertension and diabetes. The prevalence of cough was 80.9% and a high proportion presented with associated sore throat (91.0%), rhinitis (78.7%) and hoarseness (63.0%). Myalgia was reported in 48.3% of cases and subjective fever in 47.3%. The incubation time of respiratory symptoms was 7.7 days (range 0C25 days) and 51.9% of pilgrims presenting with a cough during their stay were still symptomatic on return. Among pilgrims with a cough, 69.4% took antibiotics. The prevalence of cough was significantly higher among females than men, but age, chronic conditions and preventive measures had no significant effect.

We aimed to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis on the reliability and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and deep throat sputum (DTS) compared to nasopharyngeal, combined naso/oropharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The inclusion criteria were studies that specifically assessed a sample of saliva or DTS with at least one other respiratory specimen in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on RT-PCR tests. The DerSimonian-Laird bivariate random-effects model analysis performed using STATA software with the \\"metaprop\\" package. RESULTS: From 1598 studies, we retrieved 33 records, of which 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found an overall sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86-100) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 92% (95% CI, 80-99) for double naso/oropharyngeal swabs, 87% (95% CI, 77-95) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 83% (95% CI, 77-89) for saliva, 82% (95% CI, 76-88) for DTS, and 44% (95% CI, 35-52) for oropharyngeal swabs among symptomatic patients, respectively. Regardless of the type of specimens, the viral load and sensitivity in the severe patients were higher than mild and in the symptomatic patients higher than asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides evidence for the diagnostic value of different respiratory specimens and supports saliva and DTS as promising diagnostic tools for first-line screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the methods of sampling, storing, and laboratory assay need to be optimized and validated before introducing as a definitive diagnosis tool. Saliva, DTS, and nasopharyngeal swab showed approximately similar results, and sensitivity was directly related to the disease severity.

We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in six countries. Methods Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the published reports from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United States . Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the six countries, for seven age-groups. Findings The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The differences were greater in the younger age groups. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 2.53, 2.92, 2.57, 1.83, 1.57, 1.58 and 1.48 for ages 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and 90+. There was remarkable consistency between countries in the magnitude of the M:F CFRs, in each age group. In meta-regression, age group explained almost all the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. Conclusions The sex differences in the CFRs are intriguing and are compatible with the male dominance in the incidence rates of many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the greater severity of the disease in males, particularly at younger ages, may be part of the disease mechanism and should be explored further.","output":"The male excess in case-fatality rates for COVID-19.

There has been an urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) infection in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short- term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 169 consecutive patients with laboratory- confirmed COVID- 19 with regard to their clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 years or older (88; 52.1%), 51.5% were male, and 78.3% had comorbidities. The majority of patients (106; 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%), and fatigue (33%). Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission. Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P <0.001). Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate).

The lineage B.1.1.7 (a.k.a the UK variant) was the major lineage imported into the state (24/73, 32.9%), followed by B.1.36 (20/73, 27.4%) and B.1 (14/73, 19.2%). We identified B.1.36 (45/103; 43.7%), B.1 (26/103; 25.2%), B.1.1.74 (5/103; 4.9%) and B.1.468 (4/103; 3.9%) as the major variants circulating in Bengaluru city. A distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak. Analysis of the complete genomes predicted multiple amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. In total, we identified nine amino acid changes (singly or in pairs) in the Receptor Binding Domain of the Spike protein. Of these, the amino acid replacement N440K was found in 37/65 (56.92%) sequences in the B.1.36 lineage. The E484K amino acid change which is present in both VOCs, B.1.351 and P.1/B.1.1.28, was found in a single circulating virus in the B.1.36 lineage. This study highlights the introduction of VOCs by travel and the local circulation of viruses with amino acid replacements in the Spike protein. These were spread across lineages, suggesting that multiple paths can lead to the emergence of VOCs, this, in turn, highlights the need to sequence and limit outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 locally. Our data support the use of concentrated and continued genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to direct public health measures, suggest revisions to vaccines, and serve as an early warning system to prepare for a surge in COVID-19 cases.","output":"Importation, circulation, and emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the South Indian State of Karnataka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To survey nurses' opinions about their work conditions at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. BACKGROUND: For the Spanish General Council of Nursing (the Consejo General de Enfermera de Espa?a), it was essential to have information on nursing workforce conditions and nurses' preparedness to wear protective measures at the pandemic's onset. The coronavirus outbreak was believed to have started in China and rapidly spread as a global pandemic requiring policies and actions for planning emergency healthcare delivery. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Data were collected during April 2020 and covered social demography, working conditions, training, availability of personal protective equipment, and nurses' health conditions, including the impact of COVID-19. FINDINGS: From all national territories in Spain, 11 560 registered nurses from different services completed the questionnaire. Findings indicated that the lack of personal protective equipment was a crucial issue, as well as service planning and organization, and 80.2% reported high or very high psychological impact of COVID-19. Alarmingly, 29.5% of the nurses reported COVID-19 symptoms. Of these 23.3% had been tested, and 30.2% were confirmed as being positive to the virus. The nurses deemed proper preparedness for emergencies and disasters as a significant concern. CONCLUSION: Nurses' responses showed evidence of health services deficiencies as a source of damage to their capacity to provide safe patient care and protect themselves and their families' health. The working conditions of the nurses are at critical levels and are unacceptable. The study results provide evidence regarding the necessity of suitable planning and actions being taken to enable safe patient care and safety for nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Our survey gathered nurses' views at the pandemic's onset. The evidence gathered is being used to advise policymakers and nursing organizations to take actions to control public health risks to populations. It is necessary that more investment in growing nursing workforce expertise and health infrastructure for pandemic and epidemic emergencies is provided.","output":"COVID-19 impact on nurses in Spain: a considered opinion survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs) are secondary lesions associated with entities like infection manifested by restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Our objectives are to evaluate the clinic-radiological spectrum of pediatric patients with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CC). METHODS Children (0-18 years) admitted between February 2017 and May 2020 with splenial lesions showing diffusion restriction on MRI, either isolated or within involvement of other parts of the brain, were included retrospectively. The primary lesions of the CC (e.g. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute ischemic infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme) were excluded. CLOCCs were divided into infection-associated, metabolic disorder-associated, and trauma-associated lesions, as well as CLOCCs involving other entities. Data were collected from the medical databases. RESULTS Forty-one patients were determined to have CLOCCs. Twenty-five (61%) were infection-associated, nine (22%) were trauma-associated, and three (7%) were metabolic disorder-associated cases, including 2 inherited disorders of metabolism. There were four (10%) patients with other entities, three with epilepsy, and one had an apparent life-threatening event. Six patients had a known etiology among the infection-associated group; one had multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19 and one had been infected by COVID-19 without any complications. All the infection-associated patients with isolated splenial lesions recovered totally, although six patients required intensive care hospitalization. Four trauma-associated patients had sequela lesions. CONCLUSIONS CLOCCs are associated with a spectrum of diseases, including the new coronavirus, COVID-19 infection. Infection-associated CLOCCs has the best prognosis, although severe cases may occur.

Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) was first detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Earlier this year, a variant labelled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. Recently the World Health Organization has raised concern for the variants B.1.617.2 mainly detected in India but now exported worldwide. It is paramount to rapidly develop specific molecular tests to uniquely identify new variants. Using a completely automated pipeline built around deep learning and evolutionary algorithms techniques, we designed primer sets specific to variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and respectively. Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets for each variant. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and are based on 2 mutations or more. In addition, we present an analysis of key mutations for SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, we tested the designed primers for B.1.1.7 using RT-PCR.

Marginal structural modeling was used to adjust for time-dependent confounders, and observations were weighted using the inverse probability of treatment weight. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to emulate a target trial design. Setting: 168 hospitals in 16 countries. Patients: adult ICU patients ( > 18 years) requiring MV for COVID-19 between March 01, 2020, and January 10, 2021. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 860 patients met eligibility criteria: 589 received steroids, 170 IL-6R antagonists, and 101 combination therapy, and the groups were balanced after adjustment. The median daily steroid dose was 7.5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent (IQR: 6 to 14 mg); 80.8% received low-dose and 19.2% high-dose steroids (> 15 mg/day of dexamethasone or equivalent). The median C-reactive protein level was > 75 mg/L in majority of our cohort. The use of IL6R antagonists alone or in combination was not associated with a significant difference in ventilator free days (VFD) compared to steroids alone (adjusted incidence rate ratio [95% CI]): IL6R antagonists (1.12 [0.88,1.4]), combination (0.83 [0.6,1.14]). Patients treated with low or high-dose steroids had non-significant differences in VFD compared to IL6R antagonists (beta= 0.62, 95% CI -1.54, 2.78 for low-dose steroid; beta= -1.19, 95% CI -3.85, 1.47 for high-dose steroid). The use of IL6R antagonists alone or in combination was not associated with a significant difference in 28 day mortality compared to steroids alone (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]): IL6R antagonists alone (0.68 [0.44,1.07]), combination (1.07 [0.67,1.7]). There was no difference in hospital mortality compared to steroids alone (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43,1.09 for IL6R antagonist, aOR 1.23, 95 % CI 0.72,2.11 for combination). The findings of sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary analysis. The rate of liver dysfunction was higher in the IL6R antagonist (p=0.038), while the rate of bacteremia did not differ among the three groups. Conclusions: We observed no difference in outcomes between mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients who received IL6R antagonists, steroids, or combination therapy and those who received IL6R antagonists or low or high dose steroids.

This developmental period presents a window of opportunity for strategic investment to improve trajectories of health, education and well-being among young people. More specifically, neurodevelopmental changes during pubertal maturation influence neural circuitry involved in processing emotions, risks, rewards and social relationships. Technology can be leveraged to create social emotional learning experiences for VYAs and provide opportunities for flexible, distance learning in low-income countries. The aim of this study protocol is to detail how insights from developmental science can be used to inform the intervention design, implementation and evaluation of a distance learning, social emotional learning intervention for VYAs. Methods: This study will be delivered to 500 VYAs in Temeke District, Dar es salaam. Study participants will watch culturally-relevant, animated videos on social emotional mindsets and skills and content will be paired with experiential learning activities over a period of 10 weeks. A nested smart-phone based study will practice learning social emotional skills and mindsets through engagement with multi-media material via the WhatsApp messenger application. Surveys and in-depth interviews will be administered to adolescents, their parents/caregivers and teachers before and after the intervention to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Discussion: This study is among the first to provide results on how to effectively design a distance-learning intervention to promote social emotional learning and identity development within a low-resource context. The findings will provide substantial evidence to inform new intervention approaches that are effective in low-resource contexts and strategies to reach scale among similar programs invested in leveraging technology to support adolescent health and development.

Longitudinal data from U.S. adults in a romantic relationship (N = 291) were collected via three waves of an online survey. Participants self-reported anxiety, depression, increased alcohol use, and dyadic coping since the pandemic. Relationship conflict variables included whether the participant reported that they and their partner \\"had disagreements related to the Coronavirus,\\" \\"had more disagreements than usual,\\" \\"had more verbal fights than usual,\\" and \\"had more physical fights than usual\\" in the past two weeks. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics as well as days spent in lockdown and employment change due to COVID-19. Results indicated that couples' disagreement and verbal fighting scores increased from Time 1 to Time 2, but disagreements related to COVID-19 and physical fighting did not. Couples with higher levels of dyadic coping reported fewer fights and disagreements on average. However, dyadic coping did not buffer participants from increases in relationship conflict. Increased alcohol use since the pandemic was positively associated with disagreements related to COVID-19, disagreement scores, and verbal fighting scores. More days spent in lockdown was associated with increases in disagreements related to COVID-19. The conditions created by COVID-19 may contribute to worsening relationship conflict, even among couples who start with high levels of dyadic coping. Depression and alcohol use may contribute to poorer relationship quality during the pandemic.

Studies revealed that pulsatile shear stress plays a vital role in microcirculatory function and integrity. The objective of this study was to investigate how pulsatility affects wall shear stress and endothelial glycocalyx components during ECMO. METHODS Using the i-Cor system, sixteen canine ECMO models were randomly allocated into the pulsatile or the non-pulsatile group (eight canines for each). Hemodynamic parameters, peak wall shear stress (PWSS), serum concentration of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate were measured at different time points during ECMO. Pulsatile shear stress experiments were also performed in endothelial cells exposed to different magnitudes of pulsatility (five plates for each condition), with cell viability, the expressions of syndecan-1, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) markers analyzed. RESULTS The pulsatile flow generated more surplus hemodynamic energy and preserved higher PWSS during ECMO. Serum concentrations of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate were both negatively correlated with PWSS, and significantly lower levels were observed in the pulsatile group. Besides, non-pulsatility triggered EndMT and endothelial cells exposed to low pulsatility had the lowest possibility of EndMT. CONCLUSION The maintenance of the PWSS by pulsatility during ECMO possesses beneficial effects on glycocalyx integrity. Moreover, pulsatility prevents EndMT in endothelial cells, and low pulsatility exhibits the best protective effects.

We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic control measures. METHODS: We propose a SUIHR model, which has built-in imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing to study the cross-border spreading and control of COVID-19. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we examine the effectiveness of border control policies, in combination with internal measures, to confine the virus and avoid reverting back to more restrictive life styles again. RESULTS: When the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes normal, without mandatory institutional quarantine, even very strict border control measures combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. For entities employing a confining domestic control policy, non-increasing net imported cases is sufficient to remain open. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely strict border control in entities, where domestic spreading is currently eliminated (e.g., China), is justifiable. However such harsh measure are not necessary for other places. Entities successfully confining the virus by internal measures can open up to similar entities without additional border controls so long as the imported risk stays non-increasing. Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.","output":"Sustainable border control policy in the COVID-19 pandemic: A math modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In response to COVID\\\\19, national ministries of health adapted HIV service delivery guidelines to ensure uninterrupted access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and limit the frequency of contact with health facilities. In this commentary, we summarize four ways in which differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV treatment has been accelerated during COVID\\\\19 in policy and implementation in sub\\\\Saharan Africa (SSA) C (i) expanding eligibility for DSD for HIV treatment, (ii) extending multi\\\\month dispensing (MMD) and reducing the frequency of clinical consultations, (iii) emphasizing community\\\\based models and (iv) integrating/aligning with TB preventative therapy (TPT), non\\\\communicable disease (NCD) treatments and family planning commodities. DISCUSSION: Across SSA in 2020, countries both adapted and emphasized policies supporting DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID\\\\19. Access to DSD for HIV treatment was expanded by reducing the time required on ART before eligibility and being more inclusive of specific populations including children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those on second\\\\ and third\\\\line regimens. Access to extended ART refills, or MMD, was accelerated across many countries. A renewed focus was given to out\\\\of\\\\facility community\\\\based models of ART distribution. In some settings, there was acknowledgement of the need to integrate or align other chronic medications with ART. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations to DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID\\\\19 have resulted in rapid policy change and in some cases, acceleration of implementation in SSA.

In this view, we have introduced a novel convolutional architecture with an integration of a hierarchical attention mechanism. The model comprises three parts: Feature extraction layer, which uses to extract the convoluted feature map; hierarchical attention layer, which is used to obtain weighted hierarchical feature map; classification layer, which uses weighted features for classification of healthy and seizure subjects.

The structure and function of nodes can vary significantly, with vital nodes playing a crucial role in information spread and other spreading phenomena. Identifying and taking action on vital nodes enables change to the network's structure and function more efficiently. Previous work either redefines metrics used to measure the nodes' importance or focuses on developing algorithms to efficiently find vital nodes. These approaches typically rely on global knowledge of the network and assume that the structure of the network does not change over time, both of which are difficult to achieve in the real world. In this paper, we propose a localized strategy that can find vital nodes without global knowledge of the network. Our joint nomination (JN) strategy selects a random set of nodes along with a set of nodes connected to those nodes, and together they nominate the vital node set. Experiments are conducted on 12 network datasets that include synthetic and real-world networks, and undirected and directed networks. Results show that average degree of the identified node set is about 3-8 times higher than that of the full node set, and higher-degree nodes take larger proportions in the degree distribution of the identified vital node set. Removal of vital nodes increases the average shortest path length by 20-70% over the original network, or about 8-15% longer than the other decentralized strategies. Immunization based on JN is more efficient than other strategies, consuming around 12-40% less immunization resources to raise the epidemic threshold to [Formula: see text]. Susceptible-infected-recovered simulations on networks with 30% vital nodes removed using JN delays the arrival time of infection peak significantly and reduce the total infection scale to 15%.

These cells have been described in both infections and cancer and are known for their immunosuppressive activity. In the case of COVID-19, long-term complications have been frequently observed (long-COVID). In this context, we aimed to investigate the immune response of COVID-19 convalescents after a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. We enrolled 13 convalescents who underwent a mild or asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, confirmed by a positive result of the PCR test, and 13 healthy donors without SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past. Whole blood was used for T-cell subpopulation and LDNs/PMN-MDSCs analysis. LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and normal density neutrophils (NDNs) were sorted out by FACS and used for T-cell proliferation assay with autologous T cells activated with anti-CD3 mAb. Serum samples were used for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG and GM-CSF concentration. Our results showed that in convalescents, even 3 months after infection, an elevated level of LDNs/PMN-MDSCs is still maintained in the blood, which correlates negatively with the level of CD8(+) and double-negative T cells. Moreover, LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and NDNs showed a tendency for affecting the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 neutralizing antibodies. Surprisingly, our data showed that in addition to LDNs/PMN-MDSCs, NDNs from convalescents also inhibit proliferation of autologous T cells. Additionally, in the convalescent sera, we detected significantly higher concentrations of GM-CSF, indicating the role of emergency granulopoiesis.

These events can prolong patient recovery and lengthen ICU stays. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is noninferior to chest x-ray (CXR) in identifying proper ETT depth. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of intubated patients across 4 multidisciplinary ICUs at an urban academic hospital who underwent daily POCUS assessment of ETT positioning by novice sonographers (medical students). ICU/ED physicians led 4 hour-long informal trainings to teach medical students POCUS technique. Subjects were excluded if they were COVID positive, in c-spine precautions, had recent neck surgery or planned to be extubated within 24 hours. Patient ETT position was measured using POCUS assessment (balloon cuff border ending between 3-7 tracheal rings) and compared to daily radiographic CXR landmarks (5 cm  2 cm above carina). Recommendations based on sonographic and radiographic landmarks were compared to assess sensitivity and specificity of POCUS to evaluate need for ETT repositioning. Statistical significance was assessed using the Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval. RESULTS: 20 patients were enrolled for a total of 62 ventilator-days. The cohort was majority female (55%), Black/African American (75%) and mean age 55  18 years. In 58 instances (93.5%), both sonographic and radiographic landmarks agreed on maintenance of ETT position. In 1 instance (1.6%), sonographers recommended ETT repositioning while radiographic landmarks did not. In 3 instances (4.8%), ETTs appeared in place by sonographic but not radiographic landmarks. The data yields a specificity of 98.31% CI [90.91,99.96] for proper ETT placement with a negative likelihood ratio of 1.02 CI [.98, 1.05] and NPV of 95.08% CI [94.92,95.24]. CONCLUSION: The high specificity and NPV values suggest that if ETT position appears within normal limits on POCUS (tip of ETT between 3-7 tracheal rings), ETT position is likely adequately positioned even when performed by novices. Further studies should investigate the use of POCUS as a monitoring alternative and as a reliable tool post-intubation to confirm ETT depth.","output":"Endotracheal tube surveillance: Can point-of-care ultrasound replace chest radiographs?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D, a fat-soluble prohormone, is endogenously synthesized in response to sunlight or taken from dietary supplements.

This research studies to what degree national laws and policies for adolescent contraception in Uganda and Kenya are consistent with WHO standards and human rights law. METHODS: This is a comparative content analysis of law and policy documents in force between 2010 and 2018 governing adolescent (age 10C19 years) contraception. Between and within country differences were analysed using WHOs guidelines Ensuring human rights in the provision of contraceptive information and services. RESULTS: Of the 93 laws and policies screened, 26 documents were included (13 policies in Uganda, 13 policies in Kenya). Ugandan policies include a median of 1 WHO recommendation for adolescent contraception per policy (range 0C4) that most frequently concerns contraception accessibility. Ugandan policies have 6/9 WHO recommendations (14/24 sub-recommendations) and miss entirely WHOs recommendations for adolescent contraception availability, quality, and accountability. On the other hand, most Kenyan policies consistently address multiple WHO recommendations (median 2 recommendations/policy, range 0C6), most frequently for contraception availability and accessibility for adolescents. Kenyan policies cover 8/9 WHO recommendations (16/24 sub-recommendations) except for accountability. CONCLUSIONS: The current policy landscapes for adolescent contraception in Uganda and Kenya include important references to human rights and evidence-based practice (in WHOs recommendations); however, there is still room for improvement.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is needed to detect new viral threats. Equally important is building local capacity to develop the tools required for rapid diagnosis of plant viruses. Most plant viruses are insect-vectored, hence, biological insights on virus transmission are vital in modelling disease spread. Research in Africa in these three areas is in its infancy and disjointed. Despite intense interest, uptake of HTS by African researchers is hampered by infrastructural gaps. The use of whole-genome information to develop field-deployable diagnostics on the continent is virtually inexistent. There is fledgling research into plant-virus-vector interactions to inform modelling of viral transmission. The gains so far have been modest but encouraging, and therefore must be consolidated.

Using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for US counties over a 20-day period, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths. The unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths. Counties with higher income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases. There is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports. Counties with high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths. The distribution of health risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes. The stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations.

As of 29 March 2020, the disease has spread to more 199 countries and territories worldwide. The 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is known as the probable causative agent of the illness. AREAS COVERED: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.","output":"Immune-epidemiological parameters of the novel coronavirus - a perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Having to work in unpredictable and critical conditions, emergency care services (EMS) personnel experience complicated situations at the scene of accidents which, inevitably, influence their clinical decisions. There is a lack of research into the challenges which these professionals encounter. Accordingly, the present study aims to explore the major challenges and barriers which affect clinical decision-making from the perspective of EMS personnel. METHODS: The present study is a qualitative work with a content analysis approach. Selected via purposeful sampling, the subjects were 25 members of the EMS personnel in Iran who met the inclusion criteria. The study lasted from December 2019 to July 2020. Sampling was maintained to the point of data saturation. Data were collected using semi-structured, in-depth, individual interviews. The collected data were analyzed via qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The results of data analysis were categorized into four themes and eight categories. The main themes were professional capabilities, occupational and environmental factors, inefficient organizational management, and ethical issues. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that clinical knowledge, experience, and skills contribute to emergency care personnels professional capabilities in making clinical decisions. Good teamwork skills and time management can prevent feelings of confusion when the number of the injured to be attended to is large. Effective clinical decision-making skills can not only help the personnel make the right decision, but enhances their resilience and enables them to adapt to hard and unpredictable conditions. Professional factors, organizational management, and ethical matters constitute the other major factors which influence the clinical decision-making of emergency care personnel at the scene of accidents and determine the quality of their clinical performance. Thus, it is essential that pre-hospital emergency care managers improve the quality of EMS personnels clinical decision-making skill.

METHODS Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the sleep patterns and disturbances (using a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and screen exposure time before and during the lockdown. RESULTS During the lockdown, 59.3% of children and 69.4% of adolescents with ADHD reported a change of bedtime with significant increase of ADHD patients that went to sleep at 11pm or later. Sleep duration, in contrast, resulted in two opposing processes with more children and adolescent sleeping either less than 6 hours/night or 10-11 hours/night. Among children and adolescents, respectively, 19.9% and 22% slept less than they did before lockdown, while 21.4% and 27.4% slept more hours. Bedtime delay and decreased sleep duration were associated with an increase in the screen time exposure. Moreover, ADHD patients reported an increase in sleep disturbances when compared to previous condition, including mainly difficulties falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and daytime sleepiness.

These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","output":"Effects of increasing aerobic capacity on improving psychological problems seen in patients with COVID-19: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated communities throughout the world. However, the negative impacts of another pandemic, affecting cities worldwide, arguably rival those of COVID. This destructive global health problem, which we have largely ignored, has been described as the hurry virus C the culture of speed that dominates modern lives and cities, causing us to constantly strive to go faster. This hurry virus has comprehensively infected our city transport systems from the early 20th century. Since then, as speed became a more important goal in city planning than liveability, sustainability and walkability, the consequences for health C human, environmental and economic C have been profoundly damaging. This paper argues that to respond effectively to the hurry virus in city transport, a policy of creating slow cities is required. This involves the simultaneous application of two synergistic strategies: slowing the speed of existing motor vehicle traffic; and encouraging greater use of the slower active modes. Examples of where such policies have been introduced are discussed. The core of the paper shows how C serendipitously C the world-wide response to the COVID-19 virus in cities has produced policies, strategies and tactics that also provide an antidote to the virus of hurry. For example, we discuss how cities have rapidly added new or widened bike lanes and sidewalks, and opened streets for people by restricting, slowing or banning motorised traffic. In addition to the intended anti-COVID outcome of providing safer, socially distanced space in neighbourhoods, such policies deliver co-benefits of local healthy living and movement in less-polluted, slower cities, as well as help combat global heating by reducing CO2 emissions. The paper outlines urban design and operational principles that would promote both pandemic-resistance as well as slower, more local and healthier lives. We show how, in future pandemics, robust plans for rapid, effective action will be required to shut down inter-district connections and implement social distancing to ride out any outbreaks without lasting damage to the city. We discuss one promising strategy that involves relatively self-sufficient and independent precincts, such as 20-minute neighbourhoods that are internally accessible by foot, bike or scooter, that enable people to meet most of their daily needs within an 800 metre (20-minute) return trip from home. If a virus outbreak occurs in one neighbourhood, it can be temporarily closed and isolated from other neighbourhoods, while allowing them to function. The key point is that these responses to combat the COVID virus will produce co-benefits which combat another virus, that of hurry. The 20-minute COVID-protected city will, by definition, be a hurry-protected, slow city C and what is more C it will be a key component of combatting the overarching existential threat of climate breakdown. We conclude that achieving such co-benefits in cities that remain (or return to being) fast would be far more challenging, if indeed possible at all. The pandemics of our time may allow us to reshape the behaviours, values and cultures both of urban residents and policy makers. The paper concludes that we have an unprecedented opportunity to reject the old normal and to re-imagine a new normal of cities that are slower, closer and healthier.","output":"Two viruses, one prescription: slow down"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical students need more exposure to and a greater understanding of their role in public health throughout their training, which may influence more of them to pursue careers in public health or change how they practice medicine in the future. A novel colorectal cancer education session was created for first year medical students to attempt to increase public health interest, improve colorectal cancer knowledge and discuss barriers to colorectal cancer screening. We constructed a novel integrated interactive peer led colorectal cancer educational session of panelists with a wide range of experiences in colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening. The session involved a didactic component, case presentation, and group exercises followed by assembly discussion. We surveyed first-year medical students over two consecutive years to assess their interest in public health, knowledge of colorectal cancer, and perceptions of barriers to colorectal cancer screening before and after the educational session. We also evaluated student satisfaction with the session. We compared the pre- and post-survey results to assess for changes in interest, knowledge and perceptions. 74.63% of students in 2018 and 67.7% in 2019 evaluated the session as excellent or good, with knowledge regarding colorectal cancer screening markedly increased after the educational session.

However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extended a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identified optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We found that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for <20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.","output":"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing considerations during states of emergency.","output":"Crisis Standards of Care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyze self-reported sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among individuals aged 2 to 22 years and possible associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Esprito Santo, Brazil.

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of AZB when used in combination with standard of care treatment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=81; nine sites) received AZB 12 mg intravenously once daily for 3 days then intramuscularly every other day until day 17. The primary endpoint included clinical status at day 15 versus baseline. Historical control data of 100 patients from a randomized, controlled, open-label trial conducted in China were included to serve as a direct control group. RESULTS: Notable clinical improvement, assessed by seven-point ordinal scale (OS) score and National Early Warning Score, was observed. Mean duration of hospitalization was 19.3 days. Indicators of pneumonia and lung function showed gradual recovery to normalization. No patients died but, by day 28, one patient still required respiratory support; this patient died on day 34. A higher proportion of patients receiving AZB required invasive or non-invasive ventilation (OS 5 or 6) at baseline compared with the historical control group.

The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein which may influence the pathogenesis of the concern SARS-CoV-2 through the development of antibody escape variants. We consider the effect of mutations in some of the epitope regions including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. P323L mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, the fluctuations in the dihedral angles in the epitope:paratope (IgG) interface increase which destabilize the interface. Such mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the host.","output":"Immune escape facilitation by mutations of epitope residues in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Structural vulnerabilities for people who use drugs (PWUD) were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, federal lawmakers in the United States (U.S.) invoked an exemption to the 2008 Ryan Haight Act requiring in-person evaluation to prescribe buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), which allowed for the initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine via telehealth. Despite the potential for telehealth to address some of the geographic disparities in OUD treatment access, recent research has suggested that significant barriers to buprenorphine also exist at the pharmacy level. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively assess how efforts to increase access to buprenorphine via telehealth are implemented by prescribers and pharmacists and experienced by patients. METHODS Participant observation and semi-structured interviews focused on telehealth for OUD treatment and buprenorphine prescribing and dispensing were conducted with patients (n = 19), prescribers and clinic staff (n = 24), and pharmacists (n = 10) in Pennsylvania and California between May 2020 - May 2021. FINDINGS While participants stated that telehealth for OUD treatment was a welcome option, pharmacy-level barriers to buprenorphine persisted. Geographical distance from patient to provider or pharmacist continued to serve as \\"red flags\\" for pharmacists, leading to pharmacy-level \\"red tape:\\" gatekeeping measures including geographic restrictions, telephone prescription \\"confirmations,\\" prescription cancellations and refusals. Patients' unmet expectations of buprenorphine access in some cases led to unanticipated risks including a return to injection drug use. CONCLUSION Challenges to increasing buprenorphine access persist in the U.S. even in settings where telehealth is implemented, and telehealth may inadvertently produce new barriers for some patients. Despite national support for policies aimed at increasing access to treatment for substance use disorders rather than punishment, policy shifts from punishment to treatment have not permeated evenly across all geographic areas and populations. Perceived threats of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enforcement, and self-defensive institutional practices in pharmacies, reinforce ideologies of drug law enforcement, leading to poor patient outcomes including lack of buprenorphine access.","output":"'Red Flags' and 'Red Tape': Telehealth and pharmacy-level barriers to buprenorphine in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate whether the De Ritis ratio can also be used in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as a follow-up parameter, such as NLR, which is used in the follow-up and treatment of many diseases. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients admitted to our hospital with suspected COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic data of the patients, their history characteristics, presenting symptoms, filiation status, duration of clinical stay, and length of stay in intensive care unit, intubation, dialysis, and plasmapheresis needs were examined. The patients were divided into two groups: PCR positive and PCR negative. The presenting, 5th day, and the clinical discharge values of AST, ALT, LDH, urea, creatine, eGFR, De Ritis ratio, procalcitonin, CRP, WBC, NLR, ferritin, lymphocyte, and D-dimer levels of the patients in both groups were studied. RESULTS: The DM and CAD presence in the histories of PCR-positive patients was found to be statistically signifi-cantly higher (p = 0.05, p = 0.03, respectively). Presenting symptoms of headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, and taste loss were significantly higher in the PCR-positive patients (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, p = 0.03, p = 0.02, respectively). In the PCR-positive patients, a statistically significant correlation was found between the presenting De Ritis ratios and the presenting NLR, 5th day NLR, and NLR at discharge (p = 0.007, p = 0.02, p = 0.015, respectively). In the PCR-positive group, the 1st and 5th day De Ritis ratios of females were statistically significantly higher than males (p = 0.000, p = 0.006, respectively). Albumin, procalcitonin, length of stay in intensive care unit were significantly higher in the PCR-positive patients, while the presenting D-dimer, presenting WBC, and presenting and 5th day lymphocyte values were significantly higher in the PCR-negative patients.

Although many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHODS: We report preregistered analyses from a longitudinal study that investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse US adults across five waves from March to August 2020 (n = 596) and cross-sectionally in August 2020 (n = 405). RESULTS: Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits, and sociodemographic predictors (sample A, ? = 0.25; sample B, ? = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance, but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in sample A. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are less agreeable are at higher risk for noncompliance with behavioral mandates, suggesting that health messaging can be meaningfully improved with approaches that address these individuals in particular.

Setting: People living in private households or communal establishments in England. Participants: 28,816,020 adults (47% male) aged 30-100 years in 2020 (mean age = 56), who were present at the 2011 Census and alive on 8 December 2020. Main outcome measures: Death involving COVID-19 during the second (8 December 2020 to 12 June 2021) and third wave (13 June 2021 to 1 December 2021) of the pandemic. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) separately for males to females to summarise the association between ethnic group and death involving COVID-19 in each wave, sequentially adjusting for age, residence type, geographical factors, sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic health, and vaccination status. Results: Age-adjusted HRs of death involving COVID-19 were higher for most ethnic minority groups than the White British group during both waves, particularly for groups with lowest vaccination rates (Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Black African and Black Caribbean). In both waves, HRs were attenuated after adjusting for geographical factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and pre-pandemic health. Further adjusting for vaccination status substantially reduced residual HRs for Black African, Black Caribbean, and Pakistani groups in the third wave. The only groups where fully-adjusted HRs remained elevated were the Bangladeshi group (men: 2.19, 95% CI 1.72 to 2.78; women: 2.12, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.86) and men from the Pakistani group (1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.46).

Upon vaccination, variable anti-Spike IgG responses have been found in different CVID cohorts. Immunization with two doses of mRNA vaccine did not generate Spike-specific classical memory B cells (MBCs) but atypical memory B cells (ATM) with low binding capacity to Spike protein. Spike-specific T-cells responses were also induced in CVID patients with a variable frequency, differently from specific T cells produced after multiple exposures to viral antigens following influenza virus immunization and infection.

Recently, the large diffusion of stapled hemorrhoidopexy has revealed a new unexpected pathological entity: the asymmetric mucosal prolapse. We aimed to assess the outcomes of the sectorial longitudinal augmented prolapsectomy (SLAP), a technique dedicated to asymmetric prolapse, in terms of HD symptoms, prolapse recurrence, and rectal stenosis. METHODS Patients affected by III-IV-degree symptomatic HD with asymmetric mucosal prolapse undergone SLAP of 1 or 2 hemorrhoidal columns (SLAP1 or SLAP2) were retrospectively assessed. The severity of hemorrhoid symptoms and fecal continence status were evaluated before and after surgery. Mean outcome was evaluation of medium-long-term outcomes as the occurrence of recurrence and anal or rectal stenosis. Secondary outcome was the evaluation of postoperative bleeding, reoperation rate, length of hospitalization, fecal urgency, and time to return to work. RESULTS We enrolled 433 patients (277 SLAP1 and 156 SLAP2). Hemorrhoidal symptoms recurrence was reported in 9 patients undergone SLAP1 and 4 patients undergone SLAP2, while prolapse recurrence occurred, respectively, in 4 and 2 patients. No major intraoperative complications occurred. An emergency reintervention for postoperative bleeding occurred in 13 cases undergone SLAP1 and in 5 patients treated with SLAP2. Fecal incontinence occurred in 8 and 4 cases of patients treated with SLAP1 and SLAP2.

ESKAPE bacteria which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae are considered the most important, because of their close relationship with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this work was to identify and characterize ESKAPE bacteria and to detect their possible clonal spread in medical devices, patients, and medical personnel of the ICU for COVID-19 patients of the Hospital Juarez de Mexico. METHODOLOGY Genetic identification of ESKAPE bacteria was performed by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Assembly of AdeABCRS operon and inhibition assays of pumps efflux in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were performed. Associated gene involved in biofilm formation (icaA) was performed in isolates belonging to the Staphylococcus genus. Finally, typing by ERIC-PCR and characterization of mobile genetic element SCCmec were done. RESULTS Heterogeneous distribution of ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE bacteria was detected in various medical devices, patients, and medical personnel. Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant ESKAPE members. The analysis of intergenic regions revealed an important clonal distribution of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+). Genotyping of SCCmec mobile genetic elements and the icaA gene showed that there is no clonal distribution of S. aureus.

Our aim was to determine the lifetime health and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients, healthcare systems, and society. Methods- A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of improved eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters were based on best available evidence. Results- Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion (median QALYs for eTICI 0/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI 2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase in the eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively. Conclusions- Improved reperfusion grants patients with stroke additional QALYs and leads to long-term cost savings.

The resilience capacity of the urban system plays an important role in disaster risk response and recovery. Strengthening urban disaster resilience is also fundamental to ensuring sustainable development. Various practices and research for enhancing urban disaster resilience have been carried out worldwide but are yet to be reviewed. Accordingly, this paper gives a scientometric review of urban disaster resilience research by using CiteSpace. The time span (January 2001CJanuary 2021) was selected and divided into three phases based on the number of publications. In addition, according to keyword statistics and clustering results, the collected articles are grouped into four hotspot topics: disaster risk reduction, specific disaster resilience research, resilience assessment, and combination research. The results show that most of the existing research is in the first two categories, and articles in the second and fourth categories both show a high growth rate and could be further research directions. The review indicates that urban disaster resilience is essential for a citys sustainable development. Moreover, the findings provide scholars a full picture of the existing urban disaster resilience research which can help them identify promising research directions. The findings can also help urban government officials and policymakers review current urban disaster management strategies and make further improvements.","output":"A Scientometric Review of Urban Disaster Resilience Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan of China. COVID-19 affects different people with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic with recovery without hospitalization up to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The innate and adaptive immunity appears responsible for the defense against the virus and recovery from the disease. The innate immune system, as the first line of defense, is essential for the detection of virus and subsequent activation of acquired immunity. The innate immune response is carried out by sentinel cells such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and by receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These receptors can recognize various components of the virus, which lead to intracellular signaling and subsequently the synthesis of various cytokines. These cytokines then recruit other immune cells, activate adaptive immune responses, and inhibit viral spreading. The most common receptors include Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and RIG-I like receptors. This review describes the current knowledge about the interplay between innate immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on the innate immune cells and the role of their receptors in viral RNA recognition, as well as their mechanisms for recognizing SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: The Role of the Main Components of the Innate Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the physical health, psychological wellbeing, and mental health of the whole population. Young people are among those most at risk of developing mental health symptoms or disorders related to the pandemic. Purpose: the present narrative review is aimed at providing an updated overview of the current literature concerning the psychological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection but also of the COVID-19 outbreak, environmental restriction, and social distancing on mental health outcomes among the youth population aged between 15 and 25 years. Methods: in December 2021, an electronic search on this topic was performed on PubMed. Relevant publications from January 2020 until December 2021 were included. Findings: 53 cross-sectional studies, 26 longitudinal studies, 4 ecological studies, 1 qualitative study, and 1 systematic review were included. We found many methodological limitations in the studies included, especially poor choice of study samples and short follow-ups. Little literature was in support of a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequences on youth mental health. On the contrary, many studies showed how extraordinary measures to limit the spread of the virus have impacted young people in terms of onset of new mental disorders and symptoms, suicidality, and access to emergency psychiatric services. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders show the greatest increase in incidence, especially in girls and young women. Conclusions: it seems important to pay attention to the mental health of young people in relation to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, studies with more robust methodologies and longer follow-ups are needed to establish precise indications for targeted interventions in this context.","output":"The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Youth Mental Health: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent increases in computational power and the development of specialized architecture led to the possibility to perform machine learning, especially inference, on the edge.

At present, no specific antiviral vaccine is available to combat this contagious virus. Traditional medicine has a long history of playing a significant role in managing several infectious diseases. In this context, scientists around the globe are also exploring various traditional medical interventions to prevent the covid-19 pandemic. In the present work, we summarize available scientific data advocating the use of traditional medicine for preventing COVID-19. A robust literature review was conducted using scientific platforms such as Science Direct, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Pubmed, Google Scholar, and online database like The Plant List (The Plant List 2013) version 1.1.

Currently, most evidence is generated through specific research projects, which typically require extra encounters with patients, are costly and entail long delays between the recognition of specific needs in healthcare and the generation of necessary evidence to address those needs. The Swiss Personalised Health Network (SPHN) aims to improve the use of data obtained during routine healthcare encounters by harmonizing data across Switzerland and facilitating accessibility for research. The project Harmonising the collection of health-related data and biospecimens in paediatric hospitals throughout Switzerland (SwissPedData) was an infrastructure development project funded by the SPHN, which aimed to identify and describe available data on child health in Switzerland and to agree on a standardised core dataset for electronic health records across all paediatric teaching hospitals. Here, we describe the results of a two-day symposium that aimed to summarise what had been achieved in the SwissPedData project, to put it in an international context, and to discuss the next steps for a sustainable future. The target audience included clinicians and researchers who produce and use health-related data on children in Switzerland. KEY HIGHLIGHTS: The symposium consisted of state-of-the-art lectures from national and international keynote speakers, workshops and plenary discussions. This manuscript summarises the talks and discussions in four sections: (I) a description of the Swiss Personalized Health Network and the results of the SwissPedData project; (II) examples of similar initiatives from other countries; (III) an overview of existing health-related datasets and projects in Switzerland; and (IV) a summary of the lessons learned and future prospective from workshops and plenary discussions. IMPLICATIONS: Streamlined processes linking initial collection of information during routine healthcare encounters, standardised recording of this information in electronic health records and fast accessibility for research are essential to accelerate research in child health and make it affordable. Ongoing projects prove that this is feasible in Switzerland and elsewhere. International collaboration is vital to success. The next steps include the implementation of the SwissPedData core dataset in the clinical information systems of Swiss hospitals, the use of this data to address priority research questions, and the acquisition of sustainable funding to support a slim central infrastructure and local support in each hospital. This will lay the foundation for a national paediatric learning health system in Switzerland.","output":"Clinical data for paediatric research: the Swiss approach: Proceedings of the National Symposium in Bern, Switzerland, Dec 5-6, 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu?; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is an orally administered antiviral for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections that is registered in more than 100 countries worldwide. More than 83 million patients have been exposed to the product since its introduction. Oseltamivir is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in the clinical management of pandemic and seasonal influenza of varying severity, and as the primary antiviral agent for treatment of avian H5N1 influenza infection in humans. This article is a nonsystematic review of the experience gained from the first 10 years of using oseltamivir for influenza infections since its launch in early 2000, emphasizing recent advances in our understanding of the product and its clinical utility in five main areas. The article reviews the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, including information on special populations such as children and elderly adults, and the co-administration of oseltamivir with other agents. This is followed by a summary of data on the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis in patients with all types of influenza, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza. The implications of changes in susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to oseltamivir and other antiviral agents are also described, as is the emergence of antiviral resistance during and after the 2009 pandemic. The fourth main section deals with the safety profile of oseltamivir in standard and special patient populations, and reviews spontaneously reported adverse event data from the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods and the topical issue of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Finally, the article considers the pharmacoeconomics of oseltamivir in comparison with vaccination and usual care regimens, and as a component of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.","output":"Oseltamivir in seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza: a comprehensive review of 10-years clinical experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To compare effects of norepinephrine and angiotensin II in experimental sepsis on hemodynamics, organ function, and mitochondrial respiration. DESIGN Randomized, controlled, study. SETTING University experimental laboratory. SUBJECTS Twenty-eight anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS Sixteen pigs were randomized to receive after 12 hours of fecal peritonitis fluid resuscitation and either norepinephrine (group NE; n = 8) or angiotensin II (group AT-II; n = 8) for 48 hours. A separate group (n = 8), treated with enalapril for 1 week before peritonitis and until study end, received fluids and norepinephrine (group E). The blood pressure dose-response to angiotensin II was evaluated in additional four nonseptic pigs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blood pressure target (75-85 mm Hg) was reached in both NE and AT-II, and cardiac output increased similarly (NE: from 64 mL/kg/min [60-79 mL/kg/min] to 139 mL/kg/min [126-157 mL/kg/min]; AT-II from 79 mL/kg/min [65-86 mL/kg/min] to 145 mL/kg/min [126-147 mL/kg/min]; median, interquartile range). Renal plasma flow, prevalence of acute kidney injury, inflammation and coagulation patterns, and mitochondrial respiration did not differ between NE and AT-II. In group E, blood pressure targets were not achieved (mean arterial pressure at study end: NE: 81 mm Hg [76-85 mm Hg]; AT-II: 80 mm Hg [77-84 mm Hg]; E: 53 mm Hg [49-66 mm Hg], p = 0.002, compared to NE), whereas skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate concentrations were increased. During resuscitation one animal died in groups AT-II and E. CONCLUSIONS Angiotensin II reversed sepsis-induced hypotension with systemic and regional hemodynamic effects similar to those of norepinephrine. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme before sepsis worsened the hypotension but enhanced skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate.

The prevalence of sleep problems, fatigue, use of medicines for symptoms did not differ between the three cohorts. The use of mental health services was more prevalent in the 2020 than in 2016 cohort, but there was already a statistical trend of higher use in the 2016 compared to the 2012 cohort. No differences in the incidence of any MHP, based on data of the previous year (2011, 2015, and 2019, respectively) were found.

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on flattening the curve. While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.","output":"Deploying Machine and Deep Learning Models for Efficient Data-Augmented Detection of COVID-19 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown limited benefits in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other cancers, mediated in part by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

We develop and optimize a CXCR4-targeted mRNA nanoparticle platform to effectively induce p53 expression in HCC models. Using p53-null orthotopic and ectopic models of murine HCC, we find that combining CXCR4-targeted p53 mRNA nanoparticles with anti-PD-1 therapy effectively induces global reprogramming of cellular and molecular components of the immune TME. This effect results in improved anti-tumor effects compared to anti-PD-1 therapy or therapeutic p53 expression alone. Thus, our findings demonstrate the reversal of immunosuppression in HCC by a p53 mRNA nanomedicine when combined with ICB and support the implementation of this strategy for cancer treatment.","output":"Combining p53 mRNA nanotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade reprograms the immune microenvironment for effective cancer therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the start of 2020 the rapid onset of the coronavirus pandemic forced higher education institutions across the world to pivot from face to face to remote teaching.

This 3-wave repeated survey aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of college students in China. METHODS: Using a repeated cross-sectional survey design, we conducted 3 online surveys of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic at 22 universities in Guandong, China. The 3 surveys were conducted during the outbreak period (T1: 3 February to 10 February 2020, N = 164,101), remission period (T2: 24 March to 3 April 2020, N = 148,384), and normalized prevention and control period (T3: 1 June to 15 June 2020, N = 159,187). Suicidal ideation was measured by the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A range of suicide-related factors was assessed, including sociodemographic characteristics, depression, anxiety, insomnia, pre-existing mental health problems, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 8.5%, 11.0% and 12.6% at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Male sex (aOR: 1.35C1.44, Ps < 0.001), poor self-perceived mental health (aOR: 2.25C2.81, Ps < 0.001), mental diseases (aOR: 1.52C2.09, P < 0.001), prior psychological counseling (aOR: 1.23C1.37, Ps < 0.01), negative perception of the risk of the COVID-19 epidemic (aOR: 1.14C1.36, Ps < 0.001), depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.51C303, Ps < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (aOR: 1.62C101.11, Ps < 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation.

Although some virus-encoded RNA helicases/chaperones have been predicted or identified, their RNA remodeling activities in vitro and functions in the viral life cycle remain largely elusive. Enteroviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which includes numerous important human pathogens. Herein, we report that the nonstructural protein 2C(ATPase) of enterovirus 71 (EV71), which is the major causative pathogen of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after poliovirus eradication, functions not only as an RNA helicase that 3-to-5 unwinds RNA helices in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, but also as an RNA chaperone that destabilizes helices bidirectionally and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. We also determined that the helicase activity is based on the EV71 2C(ATPase) middle domain, whereas the C-terminus is indispensable for its RNA chaperoning activity. By promoting RNA template recycling, 2C(ATPase) facilitated EV71 RNA synthesis in vitro; when 2C(ATPase) helicase activity was impaired, EV71 RNA replication and virion production were mostly abolished in cells, indicating that 2C(ATPase)-mediated RNA remodeling plays a critical role in the enteroviral life cycle. Furthermore, the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities of 2C(ATPase) are also conserved in coxsackie A virus 16 (CAV16), another important enterovirus. Altogether, our findings are the first to demonstrate the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities associated with enterovirus 2C(ATPase), and our study provides both in vitro and cellular evidence for their potential roles during viral RNA replication.

METHODS An analysis was undertaken of all patients who underwent CBT resection at Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and Greenslopes Private Hospital between 1982 and 2007. Primary tumor characteristics, surgical technique, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 49 consecutive CBT resections (2 recurrent tumors) were carried out in 39 patients (26 women [56%]) who were a mean age of 49 years (range, 17-75 years). A nontender neck mass was the presenting complaint in 85%, followed by screening in familial or contralateral tumors in 26%. Familial cases occurred in 11 patients (28%). There were no operative deaths. Complications occurred in 13 of the 49 operations (27%), predominantly temporary nerve palsies and were more likely to occur in tumors of large volume or in cases of removal of coexisting vagal tumors. Malignant disease was present in seven cases (15%). All patients have been followed-up postoperatively for a mean of 11 years (range, 2-26 years). Metachronous paragangliomas have been discovered in six patients, all with familial disease. CONCLUSIONS Early resection of carotid body tumors should be undertaken while still small to minimize the risk of neural injury, which increases with tumor size. In cases of bilateral CBT, we recommend that the smaller tumor be resected first, before the staged resection of the larger contralateral tumor. In familial or bilateral tumor cases, other synchronous and metachronous paragangliomas should be excluded.

One patient presented cough whereas the three others were asymptomatic. In the pandemic context, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was realized for each patients. RT-PCR were all positives and were associated with a substantially increased INR. Mr H. was admitted with an INR of 2.25 and it increased to 5.93 the day after RT-PCR positivity.

Design Pragmatic, descriptive, feasibility study from April 2nd to April 9th, 2020. Setting and participants: A total of 83 older residents (age 858) presenting mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and not previously tested for COVID-19, residing in five nursing homes in Northern Italy. Methods Chest ultrasound was performed at the bedside by a team of hospital specialists with certified expertise in thoracic ultrasonography, following a systematic approach exploring four different areas for each hemithorax, from the anterior and posterior side. Presence of ultrasonographic signs of interstitial pneumonia, including comet-tail artifacts (B-lines) with focal or diffuse distribution, subpleural consolidations and pleural line indentation was detected. The specialist team integrated ultrasound data with clinical and anamnestic information, and gave personalized therapeutic advice for each patient, including hospital referral when needed. Results The most frequent reasons for ultrasound evaluation were fever (63% of participants) and mild dyspnea (40%). Fifty-six patients (67%) had abnormal ultrasound findings. The most common patterns were presence of multiple subpleural consolidations (32 patients) and diffuse B-lines (24 patients), with bilateral involvement. A diagnosis of suspect COVID-19 pneumonia was made in 44 patients, and six of them required hospitalization. Twelve patients had ultrasound patterns suggesting other respiratory diseases, and two patients with normal ultrasound findings were diagnosed with COPD exacerbation.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to study whether adults with normal hearing and those with impaired hearing differ in their weekly use of smart devices, apps, and social media; reasons for using social media; and benefits from using social media. METHODS: We used data from a Dutch cohort, the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. Data were collected from September 2016 to April 2020 using a web-based questionnaire and speech-in-noise test. The results from this test were used to categorize normal hearing and hearing impairment. Outcomes were compared using (multiple) logistic regression models. RESULTS: Adults with impaired hearing (n=384) did not differ from normal hearing adults (n=341) in their use of a smartphone or tablet. They were less likely to make use of social media apps on a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.92; P=.02). Use of social media on all devices and use of other apps did not differ. Adults with hearing impairment were more likely to agree with using social media to stay in touch with family members (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16-2.07; P=.003) and friends (age-adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.81; P=.046). Furthermore, they were more likely to agree with using social media to perform their work (age-adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04-2.18; P=.03). There were no differences in the experienced benefits from social media. CONCLUSIONS: The potential for eHealth is confirmed because adults with hearing impairment are not less likely to use smart devices than their normal hearing peers. Adults with hearing impairment are less likely to use social media apps on a smart device but not less likely to use social media on all types of internet-connected devices. This warrants further research on the types of social media platforms that adults with hearing impairment use and on the type of device on which they prefer to use social media. Given that participants with hearing impairment are more likely than their normal hearing peers to use social media to perform their work, use of social media may be seen as an opportunity to enhance vocational rehabilitation services for persons with hearing impairment.","output":"A Comparison of the Use of Smart Devices, Apps, and Social Media Between Adults With and Without Hearing Impairment: Cross-sectional Web-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A curfew for elderly people was announced in Turkey to protect the geriatric population during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Although this may have the beneficial effect of preventing infection, psychological distress may also increase with prolongation of the pandemic. METHODS: Geriatric patients were interviewed by telephone due to the ongoing curfew. Demographical characteristics, comorbidities, personal risk perception of COVID\\\\19, common concerns related to COVID\\\\19, and experiences of delayed hospital admission due to the pandemic were recorded. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: Participants (n = 136; 82 females, 60.3%) had a mean age of 73.4  5.9 years. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (75%). Approximately 80% of the participants reported a decrease in physical activity during the curfew period. The HADS scores indicated rates of anxiety as 25.7% and depression as 16.9%. Anxiety was significantly more common in females than males (P = 0.002). Sleep problems (P = 0.000), fatigue (P = 0.000), and hopelessness (P = 0.000) were more common in participants with depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses showed an association between a delay in hospital admission and the presence of depression (P = 0.0029, R(2) = 0.146). Personal risk perception of COVID\\\\19 was statistically significantly higher among patients with anxiety (P = 0.0027, R(2) = 0.157). CONCLUSION: Decreased adaptation to external and internal factors among older individuals may facilitate unfavourable outcomes of the pandemic.

Since the pandemic outbreak, there is a growing interest in computational model-based diagnostic technologies to support the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 cases using medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) scans. It is discovered in initial studies that patients infected with COVID-19 show abnormalities in their CXR images that represent specific radiological patterns. Still, detection of these patterns is challenging and time-consuming even for skilled radiologists. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network- (CNN-) based deep learning fusion framework using the transfer learning concept where parameters (weights) from different models are combined into a single model to extract features from images which are then fed to a custom classifier for prediction. We use gradient-weighted class activation mapping to visualize the infected areas of CXR images. Furthermore, we provide feature representation through visualization to gain a deeper understanding of the class separability of the studied models with respect to COVID-19 detection. Cross-validation studies are used to assess the performance of the proposed models using open-access datasets containing healthy and both COVID-19 and other pneumonia infected CXR images. Evaluation results show that the best performing fusion model can attain a classification accuracy of 95.49% with a high level of sensitivity and specificity.","output":"Artificial Neural Network-Based Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Patient Detection Using X-Ray Chest Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has been a poignant reminder of the value of telehealth services to deliver care, especially as a means of reducing the risk of infectious disease transmission caused by close personal contact, decreasing unnecessary travel for medical consultations, and limiting the number of individuals in waiting rooms. The role of telehealth in ophthalmology has historically been limited to store-and-forwarding of images, much like what is used in radiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS Remote evaluation using two-way audio-video communications over the initial 10-week period of clinic shutdowns. Visual acuity (VA) measurement was attempted using a printed single surrounded HOTV or Snellen chart. The VA measurement of fellow eyes was compared to the prior in person clinical visit. External and strabismus examinations were also conducted. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients were evaluated with a mean age 12.5 years (range 5 months to 82 years). Twenty of 58 (34%) were younger than 5 years of age. Reasons for evaluation were strabismus in 26 patients (45%), refractive error in 25 (43%), and amblyopia in 10 patients (19%). Recognition visual acuity was obtained in 69% (40 of 58), including every patient older than 5 years of age. Nine children from 2 to 5 years of age (mean 3 years) were unable to perform HOTV VA testing. Of nine children unable to do complete VA testing, five had been premature and seven had developmental delay. There was a mean bias of -0.12 logMAR in favor of the prior in office test in the right eyes of 21 non-amblyopic patients. The 95% limits of agreement between the in-person visit and the subsequent telehealth video visit logMAR VA were +0.20 logMAR upper limit, -0.44 logMAR lower limit. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth video visits provided basic ophthalmic information in patients who are physically incapable to come to the office, leading to improved triage. Vision could be tested remotely in young children, but we found substantial variability in the measurement of clinically normal eyes. Improvements in the reliability of at-home visual acuity testing are needed.","output":"Remote Pediatric Ophthalmology and Adult Strabismus during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of our review is to discuss the role of CT angiography (CTA) in evaluating a variety of vascular complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was therefore to verify whether the ROX index is an accurate predictor of HFNC failure for COVID-19 patients treated outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the validity of the previously suggested threshold. DESIGN: Multicenter study. Retrospective observational analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: 3 centres specialized in non-invasive respiratory support (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Bolzano and Treviso, Italy). Patients treated outside the ICU were analysed MEASUREMENTS: The variables to calculate the ROX index were collected during the first day of therapy at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then recorded every 24 hours. HFNC failure was defined as escalation of respiratory support to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 35 (29%) patients failed HFNC and required intubation. ROC analysis identified the 12-hour ROX index as the best predictor of intubation with an AUC of 0.7916[CI 95% 0.6905-0.8927] and the best threshold to be 5.99[Specificity 96% Sensitivity 62%]. In the survival analysis, a ROX value <5.99 was associated with an increased risk of failure (pa?=a?0008a?log - rank test). The threshold of 4,9 identified by Roca as the best predictor in non-COVID patients, was not able to discriminate between success and failure (pa?=a?0.4a?log-rank test) in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: ROX index may be useful in guiding the clinicians in their decision to intubate patients, especially in patients with moderate ARF, treated therefore outside the ICU. Indeed, it also demonstrates a different threshold value than reported for non-COVID patients, possibly related to the different mechanisms of hypoxia.","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia and ROX index: Time to set a new threshold for patients admitted outside the ICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic viral diseases continue to inflict human mortality and morbidity worldwide. While efforts are on for containment of these diseases, many new viral diseases, especially those of zoonotic origin, were discovered in humans, often in newer geographical areas where diseases were not reported previously. It is now an established fact that with changes in society, demography, climatic patterns, global economy and trade, viral zoonoses have made a comeback. Many factors are responsible for the emergence of viral pathogens worldwide. These factors, known as drivers, are numerous and are complexly interlinked. Major drivers of the emergence include ecological perturbations caused by changes in agricultural practices, livestock husbandry, and developmental activities; global warming and changes in climatic patterns, various forces of globalization such as international travel, trade and commerce; human demographic changes augmented by rising population and urbanization, population mobility; human behavioural changes; microbial adaptation and evolution; changing technology and industrial practices; and deficiencies in public health infrastructure. Emergence of many new viral zoonoses, e.g. Nipah virus infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, highly pathogenic avian influenza, CrimeanCCongo hemorrhagic fever, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever, and others is testimony to role of complex set of drivers in predisposing emergence.

Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions.

This paper contributes to the literature by exploring empirically the link between fuel poverty and financial distress prior to and during the first wave the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis is based on the most recent longitudinal, nationally representative survey of the United Kingdom, Understanding Society (UKHLS, Wave 10, January 2018CFebruary 2020). After correcting for the effects of potential endogeneity in the variables of interest, our results identify a statistically robust relationship between fuel poverty indicators and self-reported measures of current financial distress, with stronger effects for subjective indicators. The fuel poverty indicators however exert only a limited influence on an individual's expectation of their future financial situation. Our analysis of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic also confirms that fuel poverty contributed to financial distress. Our main findings are robust to a suite of specification and sensitivity checks.

This study tested surgery's ability to improve measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and identified clinical, renal, and systemic vascular predictors of such improvement. METHODS Twenty-five nondiabetic subjects with severe obesity were studied before and 1 year after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, evaluating mGFR and renal plasma flow, basal renal resistive index (RI) and dynamic renal RI, renal visceral fat, and systemic vascular parameters, including flow-mediated dilation, aortic pulse wave velocity, and carotid intima media thickness and stiffness. RESULTS After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, BMI decreased by 31%. At follow-up, body surface area (BSA)-adjusted mGFR increased (from 86.9  15.2 to 109.0  18.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 , P < 0.001), whereas the absolute mGFR did not change. Renal plasma flow did not vary. RI decreased; flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness, and carotid stiffness improved. mGFR changes after surgery (mGFR/BSA) were associated with younger age and lower fasting glucose. Among vascular variables, an improved mGFR/BSA was associated with smaller brachial artery diameter, lower intima media thickness, and lower RI; this latter association remained after adjusting for covariates. No measure of adiposity was associated with mGFR. CONCLUSIONS In subjects with obesity and normal renal function, bariatric surgery improves mGFR/BSA (although absolute mGFR is unchanged) and renal and systemic vascular function.

Genetic and biological variation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been studied by subjecting 23 biological clones of the virus to 10 plaque-to-plaque transfers. In contrast to large population passages, plaque transfers led to a decrease in replicative capacity of HSV-1. Two out of a total of 23 clones did not survive to the last transfer in 143 TK(-) cells. DNA from three genomic regions (DNA polymerase, glycoprotein gD and thymidine kinase) from the initial and passaged clones was sequenced. Nucleotide substitutions were detected in the TK and gD genes, but not in the DNA polymerase gene. Assuming a uniform distribution of mutations along the genome, the average rate of fixation of mutations was about five mutations per viral genome and plaque transfer. This value is comparable to the range of values calculated for RNA viruses. Four plaque-transferred populations lost neurovirulence for mice, as compared with the corresponding initial clones. LD(50) values obtained with the populations subjected to serial bottlenecks were 4- to 67-fold higher than for their parental clones.

Patient treatment groups were similar in terms of age, gender, tumour location and grade, but unsurprisingly, larger tumours (median diameter 17mm (p<0.0001)) were found in the surgically treated group. Five patients underwent surgical resection with no evidence of tumour recurrence or disease-related death. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resection, with one local recurrence detected during follow-up. Thirty patients (28 with d-NETs &#8804;10mm) underwent 'watch and wait' with resection only if tumours increased in size.

Initially, an SGT gene, designated as OsSGT1, was isolated from O. saundersiae. OsSGT1-containing cell free extract was then used as the biocatalyst to react with 49 structurally diverse drug-like compounds. The recombinant OsSGT1 was shown to be active against both 3- and 17-hydroxyl steroids. Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify OsSGT1, we found the bacteria lacA gene in lac operon actually encoded an SGA, specifically catalyzing the acetylations of sugar moieties of steroid 17-glucosides. Finally, a novel enzymatic two-step synthesis of two ASGs, acetylated testosterone-17-O--glucosides (AT-17-Gs) and acetylated estradiol-17-O--glucosides (AE-17-Gs), from the abundantly available free steroids using OsSGT1 and EcSGA1 as the biocatalysts was developed. The two-step process is characterized by EcSGA1-catalyzed regioselective acylations of all hydroxyl groups on the sugar unit of unprotected steroidal glycosides (SGs) in the late stage, thereby significantly streamlining the synthetic route towards ASGs and thus forming four monoacylates. The improved cytotoxic activities of 3-acetylated testosterone17-O--glucoside towards seven human tumor cell lines were thus observable.","output":"The enzymatic biosynthesis of acylated steroidal glycosides and their cytotoxic activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical distancing and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence dietary behaviors. Using a parallel mixed method design, we examined the relationships between structural and perceived social relationships on dietary behaviors across the adult lifespan and by food security status. A representative sample of 360 adults (18C78 years old) living in the United States were recruited through Prolific Academic to complete an online cross-sectional survey. Participants provided data about demographics, food insecurity, structural and perceived social relationships, diet quality, and unhealthy snacking at the onset of the pandemic. Participants responded to open-ended questions about perceived changes in social connections and dietary behavior since COVID-19. Quantitative findings indicated food insecure emerging and older adults were at highest risk for low diet quality and frequent unhealthy snacking. Friend support was associated with higher diet quality. Qualitative findings suggested overall decreases in social connection and changes in dietary behavior, with food insecure adults describing decreases in diet quality. Participants who reported increases in emotional eating also reported decreases in social connection. Findings suggest the pandemic may exacerbate inequalities, particularly among food insecure emerging and older adults. Scaling up preventive interventions to increase social connection and reduce food insecurity during unprecedented challenges may promote healthier dietary behaviors now and in the long-term.","output":"A lifespan perspective of structural and perceived social relationships, food insecurity, and dietary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Artemether and lumefantrine display low aqueous solubility leading to poor release profile; hence the need for the use of lipid-based systems to improve their oral bioavailability so as to improve their therapeutic efficacy. Aim and objective: The objective of this work was to utilize potentials of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for improvement of the oral bioavailability of artemether and lumefantrine combination and to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of malaria. This study reports a method of formulation, characterization and evaluation of the therapeutic efficacies of caprol-based NLC delivery systems with artemether and lumefantrine. Method: The artemether-lumefantrine co-loaded NLCs were prepared using the lipid matrix (5% w/w) (containing beeswax and Phospholipon? 90H and Caprol-PGE 860), artemether (0.1%w/w) and lumefantrine (0.6%w/w), sorbitol (4%w/w), Tween? 80(2%w/w as surfactant) and distilled water (q.s to 100%) by high shear homogenization and evaluated for physicochemical performance. The in vivo antimalarial activities of the NLC were tested in chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium berghei (NK-65) using Peters 4-day suppressive protocol in mice and compared with controls. Histopathological studies were also carried out on major organs implicated in malaria. Results: The NLC showed fairly polydispersed nano-sized formulation (z-average:188.6 nm; polydispersity index, PDI=0.462) with no major interaction occurring between the components while the in vivo study showed a gradual but sustained drug release from the NLC compared with that seen with chloroquine sulphate and Coartem?. Results of histopathological investigations also revealed more organ damage with the untreated groups than groups treated with the formulations. Conclusion: This study has shown the potential of caprol-based NLCs for significant improvement in oral bioavailability and hence antimalarial activity of poorly soluble artemether and lumefantrine. Importantly, this would improve patient compliance due to decrease in dosing frequency as a sustained release formulation.","output":"Improved antimalarial activity of caprol-based nanostructured lipid carriers encapsulating artemether-lumefantrine for oral administration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background The Parkinson's disease (PD) patient population, with an already reduced life expectancy, is rendered particularly vulnerable by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Objectives We determined the risk factors that increase the risk of death in patients with Parkinson's disease who are infected by SARS-CoV-2 Methods Patients with a diagnosis of PD admitted to Montefiore Hospital (Bronx, New York) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified Retrospective review of electronic medical records confirmed the diagnosis;patients were classified by severity of PD PD severity, demographic, socioeconomic factors, and co-morbidities were correlated with mortality rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 Results We identified 162 patients meeting criteria;chart review confirmed a diagnosis of PD in 70 patients Of the 70 patients, 53 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 17 were negative PD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality rate (35 8%) compared to PD patients without the infection (5 9%, P =?0 028) PD patients older than 70?years of age, those with advanced Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and non-Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African- Americans) had a statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected Conclusions PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection when age was controlled However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and age greater than 70?years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality Also several socioeconomic factors contributed to mortality, for example, non-Hispanic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection fared worse, likely driven by poorer outcomes in the Black/African-American cohort","output":"Outcome of Hospitalized Parkinson's Disease Patients with and without COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk (1) mengungkap ciri ideologi eksklusi pemberitaan COVID-19 mengenai tindak kejahatan dalam media daring SINDOnews.com dan Fajar.co.id model Theo van Leeuwen;(2) mengungkap ciri ideologi inklusi pemberitaan COVID-19 mengenai tindak kejahatan dalam media daring SINDOnews.com dan Fajar.co.id model Theo van Leeuwen;(3) mengidentifikasi perbedaan strategi eksklusi dan inklusi media daring SINDOnews.com dan Fajar.co.id pada pemberitaan COVID-19 mengenai tindak kejahatan.

Its management is complex and deviations from guideline recommendations occur frequently. We developed a new interactive tablet app, named PediAppRREST, to support the management of PCA. The app received a good usability evaluation in a previous pilot trial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the PediAppRREST app in reducing deviations from guideline recommendations in PCA management. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, simulation-based, randomised controlled, three-parallel-arm study. Participants are residents in Paediatric, Emergency Medicine, and Anaesthesiology programmes in Italy. All 105 teams (315 participants) manage the same scenario of in-hospital PCA. Teams are randomised by the study statistician into one of three study arms for the management of the PCA scenario: (1) an intervention group using the PediAppRREST app or (2) a control group Paediatric Advanced Life Support (CtrlPALS+) using the PALS pocket reference card; or (3) a control group (CtrlPALS-) not allowed to use any PALS-related cognitive aid. The primary outcome of the study is the number of deviations (delays and errors) in PCA management from PALS guideline recommendations, according to a novel checklist, named c-DEV15plus. The c-DEV15plus scores will be compared between groups with a one-way analysis of variance model, followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons adjustment procedure in case of statistical significance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Padova, coordinating centre of the trial, deemed the project to be a negligible risk study and approved it through an expedited review process. The results of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, and at national and international scientific conferences. Based on the study results, the PediAppRREST app will be further refined and will be available for download by institutions/healthcare professionals.

However, considerable research suggests that a significant proportion of Americans intend to forego vaccination, putting pandemic recovery at risk. Republicans are one of the largest groups of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant individuals. Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy within this group is vital to ending the pandemic. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of messages from co-partisan sources in reducing vaccine hesitancy. In a large (N = 3000) and demographically representative survey, we find that exposing Middle-of-the-Road partisans to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan source cues reduces vaccine hesitancy. However, for those who identify as Strong or Weak partisans, we find no statistically significant differences in vaccination intentions when exposed to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan sources.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman presented with recent unsteadiness and paraesthesia in both hands. Fifteen days earlier, she complained of fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Her chest X-ray showed a lobar consolidation and PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; she was admitted due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia.In the first 48 hours of hospitalisation, she started to experience lumbar pain and weakness of the proximal lower extremities, progressing to bilateral facial nerve palsy, oropharyngeal weakness and severe proximal tetraparesis with cervical flexion 2/5 on the MRC scale. Full spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a brainstem and cervical leptomeningeal enhancement. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albumin-cytological dissociation. Microbiological studies on CSF, including SARS-CoV-2, were negative. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.

A still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.","output":"Pay Attention to Evolution: Time Series Forecasting with Deep Graph-Evolution Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publication of original research, clinical experiences, and critical reviews of literature are vital to the growth of the genetic counseling field, delivery of genetic counseling services, and professional development of genetic counselors.

We analysed histological changes induced by coronavirus MHV\\\\JHM infection in Lewis rats. Besides an acute disease (AE), chronic panencephalitis (CPE) and subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) were induced. These disease types were differentiated by the incubation period, the localization of lesions, the type of tissue damage and distribution of virus antigen. In AE and CPE, virus antigen was detected in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whereas in SDE neurons lacked virus antigen. Viral nucleocapsid protein (N) was present in the cytoplasm and the spike protein (S) was displayed on the surface of infected neural cells. However, expression of S protein relative to N protein was severely impaired in SDE lesions. Quantitative analysis of infiltrating inflammatory cells revealed that the number of macrophages and T cells were similar in lesions of AE, CPE and SDE. In contrast to that, SDE lesions contained a significantly higher number of IgG? B cells and plasma cells. In addition active demyelinating SDE lesions displayed an enhanced IgG content and deposits of complement C9.

This review is an attempt to collate the outcomes of such studies, thus highlighting the utility of AI in rapid screening of molecular markers along with chest X-rays and other COVID-19 symptoms to enable faster diagnosis and patient stratification. By doing so, we also found that molecular markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6 eosinophils, etc. showed significant differences between severe and non-severe cases of COVID-19 patients. CT findings in the lungs also showed different patterns like lung consolidation significantly higher in patients with poor recovery and lung lesions and fibrosis being higher in patients with good recovery. Thus, from these evidences we perceive that an initial rapid screening using integrated AI approach could be a way forward in efficient patient stratification.","output":"Host-dependent molecular factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection to gain clinical insights for developing effective targeted therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, manufacturing companies have faced difficulties in securing sufficient production capabilities at factories because of many regional risks, such as natural calamities and epidemics. A production line should be designed to be reconfigured to adapt to various risks for satisfying its demands. This paper proposes a flexible and reconfigurable production line composed of a combination of line workers and multipurpose equipment called robotic cells. A robotic cell performs work (similar to a worker) using a programmable arm robot. The required tasks are allocated to workers or robots. However, it is difficult to design the line configuration and task allocation, because the number of combinations is large. Additionally, the production efficiency fluctuates depending on the correlations between the workers attitude, skill level, and allocated tasks. This paper describes a production-line design method using a genetic algorithm.

However, studies are lacking related to Ethiopia and to Africa in general. AIMS: To study the mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. METHOD: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Jimma University Medical Center among 249 healthcare professionals. The data were collected using self-administered questionnaires between 22 and 28 March 2020. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Social support was evaluated using the three-item Oslo Social Support Scale. Data were analysed using logistic regression to examine mutually adjusted associations, expressed as adjusted odds ratios. The psychosocial status of the healthcare professionals was predicted using a classification tree model supported by the genetic search method. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress among healthcare professionals was 78.3%. The mean IES-R score was 34.2 (s.d. = 19.4). The ISI score indicated that the prevalence of insomnia was 50.2%. Higher psychological distress was associated with younger age, having insomnia, not having a daily update on COVID-19, and feeling stigmatised and rejected in the neighbourhood because of hospital work.

This study was setup to investigate the Omicron RBD's interaction with ACE2 (host receptor) and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb). In-silico mutagenesis was used to generate the Om-RBD in complex with ACE2 or mAb from the wildtype. HDOCK server was used to redock and score the mAbs in Om-RBD bound state relative to the wildtype. Stability of interaction between all complexes were investigated using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD). Analyses of trajectories showed that Om-RBD has evolved into an efficient ACE2 binder, via pi-pi (Om-RBD-Y501/ACE2-Y41) and salt-bridge (Om-RBD-K493/ACE2-Y41) interactions. Conversely, in binding mAb, it has become less efficient (Center of mass distance of RBD from mAb complex, wildtype  30 ?, Omicron  41 ?).

Although preventive measures such as social distancing, personal protective equipment and isolation would decrease the spread of the infection, a definitive treatment is still under way. Antivirals, immunisation, convalescent plasma (CP) and many more modalities are under trial, and there has been no definite answer to the management of COVID-19 infection. All patients so far have received the standard and symptomatic care. It is shown that the SARS-CoV 2 is a respiratory pathogen, and 80% of the infected patients would recover from the illness and it is the 20% of the infected patients require hospitalisation and even critical care. CP has been used to treat recent epidemic respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections with promising results. The CP of a recovered individual contains antibodies which neutralise the virus and decrease the viral replication in the patient. It is a classic adaptive immunotherapy and has been applied in the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases. CP is plasma taken from a person who has recovered from an infection, which contains neutralising antibodies against the said infection. Giving CP to susceptible individuals or infected patients is a form of passive antibody therapy and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, is expected to provide protection by viral neutralisation and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. The adaptive response is to a specific antigen-binding array of molecules that are foreign to the host. The human response to viruses uses both the innate and the adaptive arms in its attempt to rid the host of the invading pathogen. The humoral response is a component of the adaptive immune response that allows for antibodies to bind to foreign invading pathogens, marks the pathogens and their toxins for phagocytosis and recruits further phagocytic cells to the site via the activation of the complement system and eventually prevents the pathogen from infecting target cells. Studies from Wuhan from various institutions during the research on COVID-19 infections during December 2019 have also shown promising results. Till date, randomised controlled studies for the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking, and many countries have invited institutions to participate in clinical trials.

The survey consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related questions, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). After five months, a follow-up survey investigating the change of GHQ-12 was conducted. RESULTS A total of 712 PCPs completed the baseline survey (11.8% of those invited), 55.6% were female and 74.4% were aged between 30 and 49 years. High levels of psychological distress (GHQ-123) were observed in 29.2%, and were associated with: low preparedness, high work impact, working with infected residents, personal life impact and concerns, as well as older age and being married (p-values<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that psychological distress was associated with low preparedness (OR=0.91, 95%CI=0.87-0.96), high work impact (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.03-1.20), personal life impact (OR=1.12, 95%CI=1.07-1.17), and safety-related concerns (OR=1.09, 95%CI=1.02-1.16).

This enzymatic cascade is rapidly triggered in the presence of activating surfaces. Physiologically, it is tightly regulated on host cells to avoid uncontrolled activation and self-damage. In cases of abnormal complement dysregulation/overactivation, the endothelium is one of the primary targets. Complement has gained momentum as a research interest in the last decade because its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many human diseases. Thus, it appears to be a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention. However, detecting abnormal complement activation is challenging. In many pathological conditions, complement activation occurs locally in tissues. Standard routine exploration of the plasma concentration of the complement components shows values in the normal range. The available tests to demonstrate such dysregulation with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications are limited. There is a real need to develop tools to demonstrate the implications of complement in diseases and to explore the complex interplay between complement activation and regulation on human cells. The analysis of complement deposits on cultured endothelial cells incubated with pathologic human serum holds promise as a reference assay. This ex vivo assay most closely resembles the physiological context. It has been used to explore complement activation from sera of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, malignant hypertension, elevated liver enzymes low platelet syndrome, sickle cell disease, pre-eclampsia, and others. In some cases, it is used to adjust the therapeutic regimen with a complement-blocking drug. Nevertheless, an international standard is lacking, and the mechanism by which complement is activated in this assay is not fully understood.

We therefore used ultrasound biomicroscopy to assess left ventricular (LV) cardiac structure and function during development in Fgl2 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. The only deaths observed between embryonic day (E)8.5 (onset of heart beating) and postnatal day (P)28 (weaning) were within 3 days after birth, when 33% of Fgl2 KO pups died. Histopathology and Doppler assessments suggested that death was due to acute congestive cardiac failure without evidence of valvular or other obvious cardiac structural abnormalities. Heart rates in Fgl2 KO embryos were significantly reduced at E8.5 and E17.5, and irregular heart rhythms were significantly more common in Fgl2 KO (21/26) than WT (2/21) embryos at E13.5. Indexes of systolic and/or diastolic cardiac function were also abnormal in KO mice at E13.5 and E17.5, in postnatal mice studied at P1, and in KO mice surviving to P28. M-mode analysis showed no difference in LV diastolic chamber dimension, although posterior wall thickness was thinner at P7 and P28 in Fgl2 KO mice. We conclude that Fgl2 deficiency is not associated with obvious structural cardiac defects but is associated with a high incidence of neonatal death as well as contractile dysfunction and rhythm abnormalities during embryonic and postnatal development in mice.","output":"Fgl2 deficiency causes neonatal death and cardiac dysfunction during embryonic and postnatal development in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has recently become the recommended approach for stage I non-small cell lung cancer. However, these guidelines are not based on any large randomized control trial. Our study used propensity scores and a sensitivity analysis to compare VATS lobectomy with open thoracotomy. METHODS From 2005 to 2012, 24,811 patients (95.1%) were operated on by open thoracotomy and 1,278 (4.9%) by VATS. The end points were 30-day postoperative death, postoperative complications, hospital stay, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Two propensity scores analyses were performed: matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting, and one sensitivity analysis to unmask potential hidden bias. A subgroup analysis was performed to compare \\"high-risk\\" with \\"low-risk\\" patients. Results are reported by odds ratios or hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Postoperative death was not significantly reduced by VATS whatever the analysis. Concerning postoperative complications, VATS significantly decreased the occurrence of atelectasis and pneumopathy with both analysis methods, but there were no differences in the occurrence of other postoperative complications. VATS did not provide a benefit for high-risk patients. The VATS approach decreased the hospital length of stay from 2.4 days (95% confidence interval, -1.7 to -3 days) to -4.68 days (95% confidence interval, -8.5 to 0.9 days). Overall survival and disease-free survival were not influenced by the surgical approach. The sensitivity analysis showed potential biases. CONCLUSIONS The results must be interpreted carefully because of the differences observed according to the propensity scores method used. A multicenter randomized controlled trial is necessary to limit the biases.","output":"Propensity Score Analysis Comparing Videothoracoscopic Lobectomy With Thoracotomy: A French Nationwide Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune reconstitution (IR) after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) represents a central determinant of the clinical post-transplant course, since the majority of transplant-related outcome parameters such as graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD), infectious complications, and relapse are related to the velocity, quantity and quality of immune cell recovery. Younger age at transplant has been identified as the most important positive prognostic factor for favourable IR post-transplant and, indeed, accelerated immune cell recovery in children is most likely the pivotal contributing factor to lower incidences of GvHD and infectious complications in paediatric allogeneic HCT. Although our knowledge about the mechanisms of IR has significantly increased over the recent years, strategies to influence IR are just evolving. In this review, we will discuss different patterns of IR during various time points post-transplant and their impact on outcome. Besides IR patterns and cellular phenotypes, recovery of antigen-specific immune cells, for example virus-specific T cells, has recently gained increasing interest, as certain threshold levels of antigen-specific T cells seem to confer protection against severe viral disease courses. In contrast, the association between IR and a possible graft-vs. leukaemia effect is less well-understood.

In such a context, the study of performances of available tests is urgently needed, as their use has just been initiated for seroprevalence assessment. The aim of this study was to compare four chemiluminescence immunoassays and one immunochromatography test for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies for the evaluation of the degree of diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Salerno Province (Campania Region, Italy). A total of 3,185 specimens from citizens were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of a screening program. Four automated immunoassays (Abbott and Liaison SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG and Roche and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgM/IgG/IgA assays) and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA Technogenetics IgG-IgM COVID-19) were used. Seroprevalence in the entire cohort was 2.41, 2.10, 1.82, and 1.85% according to the Liaison IgG, Abbott IgG, Siemens, and Roche total Ig tests, respectively. When we explored the agreement among the rapid tests and the serologic assays, we reported good agreement for Abbott, Siemens, and Roche (Cohen's Kappa coefficient 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67, respectively), whereas we found moderate agreement for Liaison (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.58). Our study showed that Abbott and Liaison SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG, Roche and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgM/IgG/IgA assays, and LFIA Technogenetics IgG-IgM COVID-19 have good agreement in seroprevalence assessment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we will review our approach to rapidly converting an in-person diagnostic radiology elective to an entirely remote learning experience for medical students at our institution, including modification of course structure, software tools and materials utilized, and strategies for learner engagement and collaboration. RESULTS: Development of an online elective led to a 10-fold increase in student enrollment compared to the traditional course offering, providing a unique opportunity to reach a broad number of students, many of whom were in the early clinical stages of their medical school career. Lastly, we will review faculty feedback after participating in the remote course as well as lessons learned from the transition to distance learning and its implications for future work CONCLUSION: The current state of technology makes radiology particularly well-suited for distance learning, and with the proper tools and approaches, effective remote radiology instruction can be achieved.","output":"Innovation Born in Isolation: Rapid Transformation of an In-Person Medical Student Radiology Elective to a Remote Learning Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Department of Neurobiology & Behavior at Stony Brook University offers a large-enrollment gateway undergraduate physiology course, BIO 203 - Fundamentals of Biology: Cellular and Organ Physiology. BIO 203 is a required course in the biology and biochemistry majors and in the pre-health curriculum, and undergraduates typically register for BIO 203 in their sophomore year. Since Fall 2015, BIO 203 has been offered in two formats, traditional PowerPoint-based lectures presented twice per week (80 min / session) in a 570-seat auditorium with individual fixed seats and a flipped, active-learning format delivered once per week (113 min / session) in a 250-seat auditorium with shared desks and rotating chairs. Students in both sections had equal access to prerecorded lectures and online activities (content quizzes, journal activities and thought questions). The focus of the lecture section was content delivery while the flipped section emphasized active group learning facilitated by instructors and experienced undergraduate teaching assistants. Student learning was evaluated by performance on common high-stakes multiple choice exams. On average, students in the flipped section exhibited better performance on the common exams than students in the lecture section (Fall 2019 exam total, p &lt; 0.05 in two sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stony Brook University required large-enrollment courses to switch to online instruction starting in March 2020 and continuing through the Fall 2020 semester. The BIO 203 instructors implemented a synchronous online version of BIO 203 based on the active-learning curriculum developed for the flipped section. In Fall 2020, this synchronous online version of BIO 203 was offered simultaneously to two sections. Students in both sections had access to the same online resources (recorded lectures, content quizzes and activities) and were evaluated using low-stakes quizzes (administered during scheduled class time) and a common cumulative final exam (administered during a common final exam period). The primary difference between the two sections was the frequency and duration of the synchronous online meetings with instructors and teaching assistants. Section 01 (595 students) met twice a week for 80 min per session, whereas section 02 (257 students) met once a week for 130 min. A preliminary analysis of the scores on the common final exam indicates that students in section 01 (two meetings per week) performed better than students in section 02 (1 meeting per week) (p &lt; 0.05 in two sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test). These preliminary findings are consistent with the hypothesis that student learning is enhanced by frequent engagement in active learning.","output":"Implementing An Active Learning, Large-Enrollment Online Physiology Course During The COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The synchronization in financial markets has increased during the rise of global markets.

This is the first case in Europe, an unexpected one. This paper focuses on the issues that the arrival of CWD raises in Northern Europe, especially regarding the Indigenous Sami reindeer husbandry in Sweden. The study offers a diagnosis of the situation regarding the management of the disease and its risks. We present the importance of the involvement of the Sami people in the surveillance program in order to understand better the diseases and the reindeer populations, movement, and behavior. However, the implementation of new European health standards in the Sami reindeer herding could have tremendous consequences on the evolution of this ancestral activity and the relationship between herders and reindeer.AbstractChronic wasting disease (CWD) is the most transmissible of the prion diseases. In 2016, an unexpected case was found in Norway, the first in Europe. Since then, there have been 32 confirmed cases in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. This paper aims to examine the situation from a social and political perspective: considering the management of CWD in the Swedish part of Spmithe Sami ancestral land;identifying the place of the Sami people in the risk managementCbecause of the threats to Sami reindeer herding that CWD presents;and understanding how the disease can modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer husbandry, whether or not CWD is epizootic. Based on interviews with various stakeholders and by examining the social sciences literature, this paper shows that the health risk management is structured by a politico-scientific controversy about the recognition, or not, of atypical and classical CWD. The Sami herders are currently cooperating with the state authorities in the surveillance program to sample their herds. This involvement takes place in a situation where the balance of power between the Sami people and the state, or the European Union, is framed by its colonial context. This has consequences with respect to the definition of a common interest and to implementing sanitary measures. The particular features of reindeer herding are seen as a challenge to managing CWD risk, compared with European health standards. We argue that CWD will greatly modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer herding, whether there are positive cases or not in the Sami reindeer. By implementing new health guidelines, the authorities will create a cascading effect in Sami land and its use. The CWD situation in Fennoscandia is full of uncertainty but may cause a major shift in the organization and the governance of Spmi. In September 2020, the identification of a new CWD case in a wild reindeer in Norway started a new episode in the disease management in Fennoscandia. Our paper raises various questions linked to understanding this new step in this crisis which is not only epidemiological, but also socio-cultural and political.","output":"Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in Sami Reindeer Herding: The Socio-Political Dimension of an Epizootic in an Indigenous Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing a tough situation due to the catastrophic pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Mediation effects were tested using structural equation modelling with weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator. RESULTS: Workplace violence had both direct and indirect effects on turnover intention among Chinese health care workers. Specifically, perceived social support, mental health and perceived social support together with mental health partially mediated the relationship between workplace violence and turnover intention. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese health care workers experiencing violence during the COVID-19 outbreak were more likely to report turnover intention. Enhancing social support and reducing mental health problems would be beneficial in decreasing the detrimental effects of workplace violence on turnover intention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Ensuring health care workers' health and safety is vital in reducing turnover intention, which in turn ascertains continuity of health care delivery. Health care managers should develop targeted interventions to improve social support and prevent post-violence mental health problems.","output":"How workplace violence correlates turnover intention among Chinese health care workers in COVID-19 context: The mediating role of perceived social support and mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents for the first time the SWB-J index, a subjective well-being indicator for Japan based on Twitter data.

However, the economic value of a shortened LOS is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate incremental costs per day of hospitalization for a patient with influenza or viral pneumonia, as a proxy for COVID-19; ICU costs associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) were also determined. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of claims-based data was conducted using the IBM MarketScan(?) Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Care and the Medicare Fee-for-Service claims databases for hospitalizations due to influenza/viral pneumonia between January 2018 and June 2019. Cases were stratified as uncomplicated hospitalizations or with ICU. Ordinary least squares regression, excluding LOS or costs exceeding the 99th percentile (base case), was used to estimate incremental costs per day; a sensitivity analysis included all qualified hospitalizations. Additional sensitivity analyses used weighting methodology. RESULTS: Among 6055 and 118,419 hospitalizations in the commercially insured and Medicare databases, respectively, 5958 and 116,552 hospitalizations, respectively, represented the base case. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional inpatient day were $2158 and $3900 in the commercial population for uncomplicated hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU, respectively, and $475 and $668, respectively in the Medicare population. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional ICU day were $5254 and $608 for Commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Higher absolute costs were estimated in the sensitivity analysis on all qualified hospitalizations; the weighted sensitivity analyses generally showed that estimates were stable. Use of iMV increased costs by $35,482 and $13,101 in the commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incremental daily cost of a hospitalization is substantial for US patients with commercial insurance and for Medicare patients.

If untreated, this condition may evolve into liver impairment also co-occurred by extrahepatic involvements. Here, we aim to identify a new panel of biomarkers including IgG subclasses, Rheumatoid Factor (RF), and Free Light Chains (FLC) that may result useful and reliable for clinical evaluation of HBV-related cryoglobulinemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 44 HBV positive patients. Patients were stratified on the presence/absence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in two group: 22 with cryoglobulins (CGs) and 22 without CGs. Samples from 20 healthy blood donors (HD) were used as negative controls. Serum samples were tested for IgG subclasses, RF (IgM, IgG, and IgA type), and FLC. RESULTS: We detected a strikingly different serum IgG subclasses distribution between HD and HBV positive patients together with different RF isotypes; FLC were significantly increased in HBV-patients if compared with HD while no significant difference was shown between HBV with/without MC. CONCLUSION: The immune-inflammatory response triggered by HBV may be monitored by a peculiar profile of biomarkers.

A total of 7,099 adults and older adults consented to participate in a chatbot intervention on reducing social isolation and loneliness. The average net promoter score (NPS) was 8.67 out of 10. Qualitative feedback was provided by 766 (10.79%) participants which amounted to 898 total responses. Most themes were rated as positive (517), followed by neutral (311) and a minor portion as negative (70). The following five themes were found across the qualitative responses: positive outcome (277, 30.8%), user did not address question (262, 29.2%), bonding with the chatbot (240, 26.7%), negative technical aspects (70, 7.8%), and ambiguous outcome (49, 5.5%). Themes with a positive valence were found to be associated with a higher NPS. The word help and it's variations were found to be the most frequently used words, which is consistent with the thematic analysis.

METHOD In a cross-sectional study, 28 patients with refractory major depression, 32 patients with nonrefractory major depression, and 48 healthy comparison subjects underwent scanning using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence on a 3-T MR system. Thirteen regions of interest that have been identified in the literature as relevant to mood regulation were selected as seed areas. A reference time series was extracted for each seed and used for voxel-wise correlation analysis with the rest of the brain. Voxel-based comparisons of z-value maps among the three groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc t tests with age and duration of illness as covariates of no interest. RESULTS Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both patient groups showed significantly reduced connectivity in prefrontal-limbic-thalamic areas bilaterally. However, the nonrefractory group showed a more distributed decrease in connectivity than the refractory group, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula bilaterally; in contrast, the refractory group showed disrupted functional connectivity mainly in prefrontal areas and in thalamus areas bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS Refractory depression is associated with disrupted functional connectivity mainly in thalamo-cortical circuits, while nonrefractory depression is associated with more distributed decreased connectivity in the limbic-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit.

The motivation for this study is that MERS-CoV remains among the list of blueprint priority and potential pandemic diseases globally. Yet, there is a paucity of empirical literature examining trends and seasonality as the available evidence is generally descriptive and anecdotal. The study is a time series analysis using monthly global reported cases of MERS-CoV by the World Health Organisation between January 2015 and January 2018. We decomposed the series into seasonal, irregular and trend components and identified patterns, smoothened series, generated predictions and employed forecasting techniques based on linear regression. We assessed contributions of various risk factors in MERS-CoV cases over time. Successive months of the MERS-CoV cases suggest a significant decreasing trend (P = 0.026 for monthly series and P = 0.047 for Quarterly series). The MERS-CoV cases are forecast to wane by end 2018. Seasonality component of the cases oscillated below or above the baseline (the centred moving average), but no association with the series over time was noted. The results revealed contributions of risk factors such as camel contact, male, old age and being from Saudi Arabia and Middle East regions to the overall reported cases of MERS-CoV. The trend component and several risk factors for global MERS-CoV cases, including camel contact, male, age and geography/region significantly affected the series. Our statistical models appear to suggest significant predictive capacity and the findings may well inform healthcare practitioners and policymakers about the underlying dynamics that produced the globally reported MERS-CoV cases.","output":"Underlying trend, seasonality, prediction, forecasting and the contribution of risk factors: an analysis of globally reported cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted.728 PD patients from February 1, 2010 to May 31, 2019 were enrolled. All demographic and laboratory data were collected at baseline and 6 months after PD treatment. The study cohort was divided into four groups according to SUA level (mol/L) after 6 months of PD: Group1 (< 360), Group2 (360C420), Group3 (420C480), Group4 ( 480). The clinical characteristics of each group were analyzed. With Group2 as reference, logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between SUA levels and risk of CV events in patients undergoing PD. Use KaplanCMeier method to generate CV events risk graph. RESULTS: 728 patients were enrolled in this study, including 403 (55.4%) males and 325 (44.6%) females, with an average age of 48.66  13.98 years; of which 158 (21.7%) patients developed CV events.

One of the most densely populated countries, Bangladesh also threatens by alarming under-five childhood morbidity, which has aggravated in past years with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study attempts to understand the biological factors affecting the pre-existing respiratory tract infections in under 5 children of Bangladesh. Methods: The present study uses data from 8398 children aged below 5 years during the survey from the Demographic and Health Survey of Bangladesh (BDHS 2017-18). Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to understand the biological vulnerability factors of pre-existing acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) in under five Bangladeshi children and relate them with the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, to show effectively the effect of different risk factors on child morbidity status, we have summarized all the results into prediction graphs at various levels of one variable as the other variable changesResults: Children aged one year were 1.40 [95% CI: 1.16, 1.67] and 2.01 [95% CI: 1.70, 2.36] times more likely to experience single morbidity and comorbidity respectively compared to children aged four years. We observe that male children were 1.18 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.31] times more likely to experience comorbidity compared to their female counterparts. Prediction graphs confirm the multivariate analysis as the probability of comorbidity remains higher in the monsoon season among children, with little change in the summer and winter seasons. Further, Rajshahi administrative division followed by Barisal and Rangpur shows the highest probability of comorbid condition in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Biological factors emerged as the prominent contributor in child ARIs condition. More care is required as the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic had not only isolated the people from physical communication but also disrupted the health care facilities to care for the pre-existing morbidity condition among Bangladeshi children.

The paper presents the results of an analysis of the COVID-19-related mortality data for Spain, Italy, and Sweden, which show that within the 30- to 90-year age range, the logarithms of mortality rate depend on age linearly, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to the lines corresponding to the dependencies of the general mortality on age in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the countries and epidemic stages, the mortality doubling times within this age range are close to 7.5 years. The probabilities of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the causative agent of COVID-19, and of the development of the clinical symptoms of infection depend on age to a much lesser extent. Based on these observations, three main points are proposed for discussion: (1) Older people have become the main victims not only of SARS-CoV-2 itself but also of the measures undertaken to prevent its spread; (2) At the same time, older people are not the main force driving the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and (3) Older people can and should participate in the fight against the pandemic and in overcoming its consequences, but not through their selective isolation and other forms of discrimination. People over 65 years of age make up a considerable segment of the population and have at least as much right as other age groups to have their needs and interests be respected and observed, including the right to as high quality of life as is accessible even in extreme situations.

Shelter-in-place (SIP) orders, which aimed to reduce the spread and scope of the virus, likely also impacted this patient population. This study aims to assess the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdose before and after a SIP order. METHODS: A retrospective review of the incidence of opioid overdoses in an urban three-hospital system was conducted. Comparisons were made between the first 100 days of a city-wide SIP order during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 100 days during the COVID-19 pandemic preceding the SIP order (Pre-SIP). Differences in observed incidence and expected incidence during the SIP period were evaluated using a Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: Total patient visits decreased 22% from 46,078 during the Pre-SIP period to 35,971 during the SIP period. A total of 1551 opioid overdoses were evaluated during the SIP period, compared to 1665 opioid overdoses during the Pre-SIP period, consistent with a 6.8% decline. A Fisher's Exact Test demonstrated a p < 0.0001, with a corresponding Odds Ratio of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval (1.12;1.29). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated SIP order were associated with a statistically and clinically significant increase in the proportion of opioid overdoses in relation to the overall change in total ED visits.","output":"Impact of a shelter-in-place order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of opioid overdoses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lockdown has been enforced globally to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with uncontrolled asthma are at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, highlighting the priority of adequate asthma control during the pandemic. Staying indoors exposes asthmatics to indoor asthma triggers, including disinfectants used for limiting the virus spread, in addition to psychological stresses of the pandemic which represent crucial contributors to loss of asthma control. Elective medical care, curtailed by the lockdown procedures, compromises adequate asthma follow up. The current study evaluated the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the level of asthma control and mental health of bronchial asthma patients. The study included 264 bronchial asthma patients, aged 12 years and older, who responded to an online questionnaire including the asthma control test to evaluate asthma control in the preceding 4 weeks. Anxiety and depression scores and the impact of event scale were also provided. RESULTS: Seventy percent of asthmatics had uncontrolled asthma, and disinfectant use was associated with perceived increase in asthma symptoms in 77.7%. Anxiety and depression were associated with uncontrolled asthma in 50% of participants, suggesting a possible psychological impact on asthma patients. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, asthma patients participating in the study had significantly uncontrolled disease and associated anxiety and depression. Since regular follow-up of asthma patients is cornerstone to adequate asthma control, alternative methods of medical care for asthma patients during lockdown are warranted, and particular need for mental health support ought to be provided as a continuum to adequate asthma control.","output":"Level of asthma control and mental health of asthma patients during lockdown for COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Free tissue transfer to improve bulk and contour in facial deformities has been proven useful, yet refinements that turn an acceptable result into an excellent result are essential to reconstruction. The authors reviewed their experience and described these refinements. METHODS The charts of 371 free tissue transfer cases (1989 to 2010) performed by the senior author (J.W.S.) were reviewed. Free tissue transfer of a circumflex scapular variant flap or superficial inferior epigastric was performed to treat deformities arising from hemifacial atrophy (n = 126), hemifacial microsomia (n = 89), radiation therapy (n = 40), bilateral malformations including lupus and polymyositis (n = 50), other congenital anomalies (n = 25), facial palsy (n = 17), and burns and trauma (n = 24). RESULTS Revision surgery planning began at initial flap operation where the flap was stretched maximally and interdigitated with recipient tissue. More tissue was required in the malar region. Revision refinement was indicated in all cases (after 6 months). Flap revision involved liposuction, debulking, reelevation, and release of tethering, followed by tissue rearrangement by means of advancement, rotation, transposition, and/or turnover flaps of subcutaneous tissues from the previous free flap. The jawline frequently required more debulking. Periorbital reconstruction was combined with lower lid support with or without canthal repositioning. Conventional face-lift techniques with the flap as superficial musculoaponeurotic system augmented the result. Autologous fat injection to the alar rim, medial canthus, upper eyelid, and lip was a useful adjunct. Severe lip deficiencies were addressed with local flaps.

We examined the indirect impact of the pandemic on a population of critically ill children in the United States. Research Question Were there significantly fewer critically ill children admitted to PICUs during the 2nd quarter of 2020, and were there significant changes in the types of diseases admitted? Study Design and Methods Retrospective observational cohort study using the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS, LLC) database. Participants were 160,295 children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at 77 sites in the United States during quarters 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) of 2017-2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020 (COVID). Results The average number of admissions was similar between pre-COVID Q1 and COVID Q1, but decreased by 32% from pre-COVID Q2 to COVID Q2 (20,157 to 13,627 admissions/quarter). The largest decreases were in respiratory conditions, including asthma (1,327 subjects in pre-COVID Q2 [6.6% of patients] vs 241 subjects in COVID Q2 [1.8%]; p<0.001) and bronchiolitis (1,299 [6.5%] vs 121 [0.9%]; p<0.001). The percentage of trauma admissions increased, though the raw number of trauma admissions decreased. Admissions for diabetes mellitus and poisoning/ingestion also increased. In the multivariable model, illness severity-adjusted odds of ICU mortality for PICU patients during COVID Q2 increased compared to pre-COVID Q2 [OR 1.165; 95% CI 1.00, 1.357; p=0.049].

The availability of biplane imaging for ultrasound guided peripheral access has the potential to improve successful venous cannulation compared with standard plane imaging. DESIGN: Single-center quasi-randomized (alternate allocation) crossover trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU at the Massachusetts General Hospital. SUBJECTS: Twenty surgical ICU nurses with no prior experience using ultrasound for peripheral IV were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: All participants viewed instructional videos on single-plane and biplane imaging for peripheral IV insertion. The participants were then quasi-randomly assigned to use either single-plane or biplane imaging for peripheral IV insertion using a phantom model. The time to catheter completion, successful lumen cannulation, and attempts in which the needle was observed to go through the back wall of the vessel were recorded for each of the three attempts. The following day the participants repeated the peripheral IV insertion with the alternate imaging modality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Biplane imaging compared with single-plane imaging was associated with a significantly greater overall success rate (78.3%  22.4% vs 41.7%  26%; p < 0.001), higher first-pass success rate (80%  41% vs 45%  51%; p = 0.015), faster cannulation times (27.8  14.8 vs 36.6  15.8 s; p = 0.003), and reduced frequency of backwall perforations (0.4  0.7 vs 1.5  0.8; p < 0.001).

The US government has sponsored the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, for public health emergencies; however, federally supported programs, including the Public Health and Emergency Preparedness program and Cities Readiness Initiative, have historically emphasized antibiotic pill dispensing over mass vaccination. While mass vaccination and pill dispensing programs share similarities, they also have fundamental differences that require dedicated preparedness efforts to address. To date, only a limited number of public assessments of local mass vaccination operational capabilities have been conducted. To fill this gap, we interviewed 37 public health and preparedness officials representing 33 jurisdictions across the United States. We aimed to characterize their existing mass vaccination operational capacities and identify challenges and lessons learned in order to support the efforts of other jurisdictions to improve mass vaccination preparedness. We found that most jurisdictions were not capable of or had not planned for rapidly vaccinating their populations within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 weeks). Many also noted that their focus on pill dispensing was driven largely by federal funding requirements and that preparedness efforts for mass vaccination were often self-motivated. Barriers to implementing rapid mass vaccination operations included insufficient personnel qualified to administer vaccinations, increased patient load compared to pill-dispensing modalities, logistical challenges to maintaining cold chain, and operational challenges addressing high-risk populations, including children, pregnant women, and non-English-speaking populations. Considering the expected availability of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine for distribution and dispensing to the public, our findings highlight critical considerations for planning possible future mass vaccination events, including during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Current State of Mass Vaccination Preparedness and Operational Challenges in the United States, 2018-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports the results of a qualitative study regarding the main attitudes and concerns of Swiss psychiatrists related to the utility, usability and acceptability of EHR and how they address the pitfalls of sharing sensitive information with other parties.

In the first half of 2020 tropic antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxochloroquine (HCQ) were the focus of tremendous public attention. In the initial periods of the pandemic, many scientific results pointed out that CQ/HCQ could be very effective for patients with severe COVID. While CQ and HCQ have successfully been used against several diseases (such as malaria, autoimmune disease and rheumatic illnesses); long term use of these agents are associated with serious adverse effects (i.e. inducing acute kidney injury, among many others) due to their role in blocking autophagy-dependent self-degradation. Recent experimental and clinical trial data also confirmed that there is no sufficient evidence about the efficient usage of CQ/HCQ against COVID-19. By using systems biology techniques, here we show that the cellular effect of CQ/HCQ on autophagy during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or following SARS-CoV-2 infection results in upregulation of ER stress. By presenting a simple mathematical model, we claim that although CQ/HCQ might be able to ameliorate virus infection, the permanent inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ has serious negative effects on the cell. Since CQ/HCQ promotes apoptotic cell death, here we confirm that addition of CQ/HCQ cannot be really effective even in severe cases.

Subsequently, total diclofenac content and dissolved intraluminal drug concentrations as well as drug thermodynamic solubility were determined in gastrointestinal aspirates. In all volunteers, gastric supersaturation resulted in precipitation of diclofenac in the stomach. The extent of precipitation correlated well with gastric pH (r = - 0.78). pH dependency of precipitation was corroborated by the absence of precipitate in the stomach after coadministration of a meal and/or a PPI. Diclofenac was found to be fully dissolved in the duodenum in all test conditions. It can be concluded that substantial pH-dependent gastric precipitation of a weakly acidic BCS Class II drug administered as a solution occurs in humans. With regard to its implications for intestinal absorption, results suggest the instantaneous redissolution of gastric drug precipitate upon transfer to the duodenum.","output":"Gastrointestinal Behavior of Weakly Acidic BCS Class II Drugs in Man--Case Study of Diclofenac Potassium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atmospheric oxidation can produce electrophilic compounds, altering the health effects induced by fine particulate matter (PM2.5); however, little is known about these electrophilic compounds or their health effects.

Most were oxygen-containing compounds with 3-17 double bond equivalents (DBE), suggesting the dominance of oxidized aromatic structures. Over 64% of the species, mostly outdoor-originated, were associated with inflammatory cytokines in both exhaled breath condensate and serum. Primary components of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and high-DBE oxygenated PAHs, mainly from fossil fuel combustion, were positively associated with interleukin (IL)- 6, a cytokine related to oxidative homeostasis. Oxidized secondary species, particularly maleic and phthalic anhydrides, were negatively associated with IL-2/IL-8, which changed by - 3.8% to - 16.4% per one-fold increase in the abundance of the secondary source, indicating the immune disorders in response to the oxidized aerosols.

To provide theoretical basis for the formulation of comprehensive prevention and treatment strategy of cirrhosis in Wuwei. Methods: Herein, we extracted data of cirrhosis patients who were treated in 12 sentinel hospitals in Wuwei from their medical records. We used SAS and Joinpoint Regression Program for data analysis, SaTScan 9.4 software for clustering area detection, and ArcGIS 10.2 software for geographical distribution mapping. Results: Among 3308 patients with liver cirrhosis (average age, 55.34 years) included in this study, 15.9% were aged 50-54 years. The majority were men (2716, 65.8%), with a sex ratio of 1.92:1 and peasants by occupation (1369, 60.3%). The basic social medical insurance system covered the healthcare costs of 1271 patients (63%). A Joinpoint regression analysis done for 1995-2016 revealed an increase in the standardized cirrhosis rate [average annual percent change (AAPC) = 16.7% (95% CI, 10.2-23.5%)] with three joinpoints in 2010, 2013, and 2016. The annual percent change (APC) from 1995 to 2010 was 11.13% (95% CI: 6.5-16.0), and APC from 2010 to 2013 was 66.48% (95% CI:16.0-138.9); conversely, from 2013 to 2016, APC was 4.4% (95% CI, -7.5-17.8%). Hongshagang Town showed the highest average incidence. Each township showed a gradual increase in the incidence after 2010. The results revealed that in each township, liver cirrhosis incidence had some spatial aggregation and was nonrandom. Four liver cirrhosis clusters were noted in 75 townships in Wuwei. Data were gathered from 2011 to 2016. Conclusions: From 1995 to 2016, the incidence of cirrhosis in Wuwei still showed an increasing trend, but the growth rate slowed down since 2013.

Patients were divided into two groups according to the clinic each patient visited: the physician-pharmacist joint clinic (joint group, n=59) or physician-only clinic (usual group, n=54). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Morisky Medication Adherence Measure (MMAM) were used to collect data on pain intensity, interference, and medication adherence. Pain Management Index (PMI) was also calculated. BPI, MMAM, and PMI were assessed at baseline (patients' first visit, week 0) and week-4 follow-up. The Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess patients' Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at week 4. The primary outcomes were the improvement in pain intensity, adequacy of pain management, and medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the improvement in HRQoL. At week 4, compared to the usual group, the BPI pain intensity categories except the pain right now were significantly lower in the joint group: worst pain, 4 (3 - 7) versus 6 (4 - 8), P = 0.020; least pain, 1 (0 - 2) versus 2 (1 - 3), P = 0.010; average pain, 3 (2 - 4) versus 4 (2 - 5), P = 0.023; pain right now, 2 (1 - 3) versus 2 (0 - 4), P = 0.796.

Particularly conducting assessments remotely during COVID-19 has posed extraordinary challenges for higher education institutions owing to lack of preparation superimposed with the inherent problems of remote assessment. In the current study, the challenges of remote assessment during COVID-19 incident in higher education institutions were investigated taking Middle East College as a case study. For the study, questionnaires were prepared and data from 50 faculties were collected and analyzed. The study focused on the challenges of remote assessment in general and academic dishonesty in particular. The main challenges identified in remote assessment were academic dishonesty, infrastructure, coverage of learning outcomes, and commitment of students to submit assessments. To minimize academic dishonesty, preparing different questions to each student was found to be the best approach. Online presentation was also found to be good option to control academic integrity violations. Combining various assessment methods, for instance report submission with online presentation, helps to minimize academic dishonesty since the examiner would have a chance to confirm whether the submitted work is the work of the student.","output":"Challenges of remote assessment in higher education in the context of COVID-19: a case study of Middle East College"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome that causes an elevated risk of catastrophic declines in the health and function among older adults - we hypothesized that frailty may be related to the maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion. Methods The study sample was a group of 199 consecutive patients over 60 (average age 71.41  6.99; 40.2% women) with AF who were hospitalized in order to perform electrical cardioversion. The Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) was used to assess frailty before cardioversion. The six-month visit after the electrical cardioversion was a follow-up. The follow-up period for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion was 180  14 days. Results Patients in whom cardioversion was effective had a statistically significantly lower severity of frailty syndrome (3.44  1.83 vs 5.87  1.12; p=0.000) and its components: physical components (2.14  1.33 vs 3.62  1.05 p=0.000); emotional components (0.92  0.79 vs 1.29  0.86 p=0.037) and social components (0.37  0.56 vs 0.96  0.46; p=0.000) compared to those patients in which cardioversion was ineffective. In the logistic regression, frailty (OR: 0.65, 95% CI:0.5010-0.8330; p=0.000) was observed to be an independent predictor for maintaining sinus rhythm. Conclusion Frailty is a novel, independent factor that can be used to predict the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion and the maintenance of sinus rhythm in the elderly population. Modifying the level of recognition in the Tilburg Frailty Indicator to a 4 improved the prediction of the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion as well as the maintenance of sinus rhythm.","output":"Modified Frailty as a Novel Factor in Predicting the Maintenance of the Sinus Rhythm After Electrical Cardioversion of Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly Population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the use of digital technology in healthcare, telemedicine has not been readily adopted.

In order to contribute to these debates, this data memo, the final in our summer 2020 series on COVID, considers this question based on an analysis of social media discourse in two week-long periods in late May and early July. We findthat only a very small proportion of tweets in election-related trends concern both the election and COVID. In the May period, there was much evidence of conspiracy-style and misinformative content, largely attacking the Democrats, the seriousness of COVID and postal-voting. Tweets also showed that the stances of the Presidential nominees towards the coronavirus has emerged as a major point of political differentiation. In the July period, tweets about COIVD and the election were dominated by the influence of a new anti-Trump Political Action Committee's viral videos, with the hashtags associated with these videos found in 2.5% of all tweets in election-related trends across the period. However, this criticism was not mirrored in the wider dataset of election-related or political tweets in election-related trends. Criticism of Trump was frequent across all time periods and samples, but discourse focused far more on Trump especially in the July period in which tweets about Trump outnumbered tweets about Biden 2 to 1. We conclude that these patterns suggest the issue of COVID in the US has become so highly politicised that it is largely only one side of the political spectrum engaging with how COVID will impact the US election.

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. METHODS: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common.

Respite care and short breaks are an essential service, however, needs often go unmet after the transition to adult services, leading to a significant impact on the life expectancy and quality of life for this population. We aim to identify, appraise and synthesise relevant evidence to explore respite care and short breaks provision for this population, and to develop a conceptual framework for understanding service models. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A mixed-methods systematic review conducted in two stages: (1) knowledge map and (2) evidence review. We will comprehensively search multiple electronic databases; use the Citations, Lead authors, Unpublished materials, Google Scholar, Theories, Early examples, and Related projects (CLUSTER) approach, search relevant websites and circulate a 'call for evidence'. Using the setting, perspective, intervention/phenomenon of interest, comparison and evaluation framework, two reviewers will independently select evidence for inclusion into a knowledge map and subsequent evidence review, extract data relating to study and population characteristics, methods and outcomes; and assess the quality of evidence. A third reviewer will arbitrate where necessary.Evidence will be synthesised using the following approaches: quantitative (narratively/conducting meta-analyses where appropriate); qualitative (framework approach); policy and guidelines (documentary analysis informed approach). An overall, integrated synthesis will be created using a modified framework approach. We will use Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)/GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research to assess the strength and confidence of the synthesised evidence. Throughout, we will develop a conceptual framework to articulate how service models work in relation to context and setting. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this is a systematic review. We will present our work in academic journals, at appropriate conferences; we will disseminate findings across networks using a range of media.

AVPs are well-established occlusion devices for vascular anomalies in congenital heart disease (CHD). The AVP2 is sometimes preferred to the AVP4 due to its shorter length, flat-profiled retention disks, and the availability of larger diameters, but its profile requires a larger inner lumen for safe delivery. The latter may actually hamper access to target lesions. This is a retrospective analysis of all CHD patients treated with the AVP2 and AVP4 between 12/2012 and 12/2015. Target vessels were characterized, measured, and the device-to-vessel diameter ratio calculated. A modified pigtail technique for AVP2 delivery was frequently used: a floppy wire was simply reinforced by the curved tip of a pigtail catheter (instead of the long sheath's dilator) to guide the required delivery sheath towards the desired landing zone. 59 patients with a median age and bodyweight of 3.0 years (range 0.1-75) and 13.8 kg (range 2.5-80) underwent the implantation of 106 plug-devices (30 AVP2, 76 AVP4) in 91 target vessels. Indications for their use were ductus arteriosus (19%), aortopulmonary (43%) as well as venovenous collaterals (34%) and other miscellaneous lesions (4%). The pigtail-supported AVP2 delivery in six patients proved very convenient. No complications occurred. AVPs are excellent devices for embolizing shunt vessels in CHD patients. Here, we describe a simplified telescoping technique for AVP2 delivery to enter curvy target lesions gently and efficiently.","output":"Collateral closure in congenital heart defects with Amplatzer vascular plugs: single-center experience and a simplified delivery technique for exceptional cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infection, and the crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned in various aspects Good information exposure related to transmission, prevention, and risk factors of COVID-19 can be the best means to reduce the risk of disease exposure and mitigate further spread The countries that have well practiced this strategy (society information exposure) were controlling disease progression, but there is a low practice in sub-Saharan countries, including Ethiopia Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the information exposure level about COVID-19 and influencing factors among northwest community of Ethiopia METHODS AND MATERIALS: Community-based cross-sectional study design was employed among the community of Gondar city from April 20 to 27, 2020 A total of 623 study participants were involved in this interview, and a systematic sampling technique was applied to select the households Data were entered into EpiData version 4 6 and then exported to STATA version 14 for analysis A multivariable binary logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with good information exposure about COVID-19 The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated to show the strength of association A p-value &lt;0 05 was a cut-off point to declare statistical significance RESULTS: The overall rate of information exposure about COVID-19 was 44 9% Age 18-26 years [AOR=0 53;95% CI (0 28-0 99)] and 34-45 years [AOR=0 44;95% CI (0 24-0 80)], elementary school [AOR=2 48;95% CI (1 20-5 15)], secondary school [AOR=3 98;95% CI (1 99-7 99)], college and above [AOR=8 38;95% CI (4 10-17 26)], browsed or follow social media [AOR=2 21;95% CI (1 44-3 38)] and those having a discussion with their family members [AOR=2 37;95% CI (1 44-3 90)] and friends [AOR=2 15;95% CI (1 38-3 34)] were the factors significantly associated with good information exposure towards COVID-19 CONCLUSION: Communities total level of good information exposure from different information platforms about COVID-19 in this study area remains low Age, high level of education, browsing social media, and those having interpersonal (family and friends) discussion were the factors that significantly influence communities who have good information exposure related to COVID-19 Therefore, efforts on community mobilization through regional/national mass media and other information conveying platforms are recommended","output":"Community Level of COVID-19 Information Exposure and Influencing Factors in Northwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Massively open online courses (MOOCs) represent an incumbent technology that, in light of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, are receiving renewed attention, with innovative applications for lifelong learning.

We utilized total population data from 24,693 Danish households with 53,584 potential secondary cases to estimate household transmission of the Delta VOC in relation to vaccination status. We found that the vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility (VES) was 61% (95%-CI: 59-63) and that the vaccine effectiveness against transmissibility (VET) was 42% (95%-CI: 39-45). We also found that unvaccinated individuals with an infection exhibited a higher viral load (one third of a standard deviation) compared to fully vaccinated individuals with a breakthrough infection. Our results imply that vaccinations reduce susceptibility as well as transmissibility.

Many techniques using newer instruments have emerged but none has been standardized. We describe our technique and experience, using non-articulating instruments with conventional trocars. METHOD Patients who underwent SILC over 2 years (July 2009-July 2011) were included in the study group. All consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies done during the same period by the same surgeon were included in the control group. Demographic data, previous abdominal surgeries, bile spillage, conversion, and duration of surgery were analyzed. RESULTS Seventy patients underwent SILC while 115 patients had laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ninety-three percent of SILCs were done in women as compared to 68 % in the control group (p < 0.0001). More SILC patients were younger (65 % were 30-50 years old) as compared to control patients (40 % were 50-70 years old, p < 0.001). The mean duration of SILC was 68  2.15 min as compared to 66  6.27 min in controls (p < .0001). Of the initial 20 SILC, nine required insertion of additional instruments and one was converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The subsequent 50 cases of SILC had only one conversion (p = 0.001). In the first 20 SILC, one patient (out of three) with BMI above 35 kg/m(2) required conversion to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and one required insertion of an additional instrument. In the subsequent 50 cases, all the six patients with BMI above 35 (up to 40) were operated on successfully without any additional instrument insertion or conversion. CONCLUSIONS SILC has a learning curve. Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, and cholecystitis, age less than 75 years, and BMI <40 can undergo SILC. With experience, SILC using conventional laparoscopy instruments has comparable outcomes to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in properly selected patients and is economical.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) using non-articulating instruments and conventional trocars-single surgeon experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to ravage the world, it is important to understand how frontline clinicians manage ventilatory support and the various limiting factors. METHODS: An online survey composed of 32 questions was developed and validated by an international expert panel. RESULTS: Overall, 502 respondents from 40 countries across six continents completed the survey. The mean number (SD) of ICU beds was 64  84. The most popular initial diagnostic tools used for treatment initiation were arterial blood gas (48%) and clinical presentation (37.5%), while the national COVID-19 guidelines were the most used (61.2%). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (53.8%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (47%), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (92%) were mostly used for mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases, respectively. However, only 38.8%, 56.6% and 82.9% of the respondents had standard protocols for HFNC, NIV, and IMV, respectively. The most frequently used modes of IMV and NIV were volume control (VC) (36.1%) and continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support (CPAP/PS) (40.6%). About 54% of the respondents did not adhere to the recommended, regular ventilator check interval. The majority of the respondents (85.7%) used proning with IMV, with 48.4% using it for 12C16 hours, and 46.2% had tried awake proning in combination with HFNC or NIV. Increased staff workload (45.02%), lack of trained staff (44.22%) and shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) (42.63%) were the main barriers to COVID-19 management. CONCLUSION: Our results show that general clinical practices involving ventilatory support were highly heterogeneous, with limited use of standard protocols and most frontline clinicians depending on isolated and varied management guidelines. We found increased staff workload, lack of trained staff and shortage of PPE to be the main limiting factors affecting global COVID-19 ventilatory support management.","output":"Global Current Practices of Ventilatory Support Management in COVID-19 Patients: An International Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinovirus (HRV) is a highly prevalent pathogen and a major cause of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). HRV express less seasonality than other viral ARTIs, which typically appear as seasonal epidemics lasting for 1C2 months. The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal patterns of HRV types over four consecutive years in one geographic region. HRV identified in respiratory samples from 114 patients over a four-year period were analysed by VP4/VP2 sequencing. HRV-A was found in 64, HRV-B in 11 and HRV-C in 37 cases. Overall, 33 different HRV-A types, nine B types and 21 C types were found. As many as 21 of the HRV types appeared during several seasons, with a maximum time-span of four years. Some types appeared during successive seasons and, in some cases, phylogenetic analysis indicated extended periods of circulation locally. Most of the strains were closely related to HRV identified in other parts of the world during the same time period. HRV strains that circulate locally represent many types and seem to reflect that HRV infections are highly globalised. The existence of simultaneous or successive epidemics with different HRV types in combination with the ability of each type to remain in the local population over extended periods of time may contribute to explaining the high rate of HRV infections.","output":"Rhinovirus infections in western Sweden: a four-year molecular epidemiology study comparing local and globally appearing types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ways to maintain good health during a pandemic are very important for the general population; however, little is known about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) on individuals life satisfaction and perceived general health.

Medical trainees commonly experience racism and bias. More than half of pediatric residents at a single institution reported experiencing or witnessing discriminatory behavior at work; only 50% reported receiving training on implicit bias, delivering difficult feedback, or peer support. Our multispecialty team created Realizing Inclusion and Systemic Equity in Medicine: Upstanding in the Medical Workplace (RISE UP), an antibias, anti-racism communication curriculum composed of three hybrid (virtual and in-person) workshops. METHODS: During the pediatric resident workshops, we introduced tools for addressing bias, presented video simulations, and led small-group debriefings with guided role-play. We also reviewed escalation pathways, reporting methods, and support systems. Residents completed an evaluation before and after each workshop to assess the curriculum's efficacy. RESULTS: Thirty-nine residents participated in RISE UP, with 20 attending all three workshops. Ninety-six percent of participants indicated they would recommend the workshops to colleagues. After the third workshop, 92% reported having tools to respond to bias, and 85% reported knowing how to escalate concerns regarding discriminatory behavior. Chief residents were most frequently identified as sources of resident support when encountering discriminatory behavior. DISCUSSION: This curriculum was successful in developing and strengthening residents responses to discrimination, including upstander support. The curriculum is adaptable for virtual, in-person, and hybrid settings, allowing for flexibility. Establishing institutional support, promoting faculty development, and creating and disseminating escalation pathways are critical to addressing racism in health care.","output":"Realizing Inclusion and Systemic Equity in Medicine: Upstanding in the Medical Workplace (RISE UP)an Antibias Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which may cause acute respiratory infection and severe pneumonia. As of October 06, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was about 35,786,851 with 1,049,816 deaths. Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of COVID-19, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, and small molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Development of medications preventing the entry of the virus into host cells through ACE2 is a promising approach. Drug discovery and development is a challenging, time consuming, and expensive process. Computational tools can act as a virtual shortcut, assisting in the expedition of this long process and potentially reducing the cost of research and development. During this pandemic situation, in silico tools have proven their efficacy in easy identification of novel inhibitors. In the present chapter, recent researches on the application of computational modeling approaches for the design and identification of candidates targeted against ACE2-mediated corona viral entry have been reviewed. Computational works encompassing homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, pharmacophore mapping, and quantitative structureCactivity relationship (QSAR) studies involving potential inhibitors of ACE2 facilitated entry of virus have been covered in this chapter.","output":"Computational Modeling of ACE2-Mediated Cell Entry Inhibitors for the Development of Drugs Against Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has highlighted and exacerbated many global health inequities.

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical severity and inflammation markers in children and adolescents with COVID-19. The clinical and laboratory records of 103 pediatric cases with COVID-19, whose vitamin D levels had been measured, were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were divided into groups according to their clinical severity (asymptomatic, mild, and moderate-to-severe) and vitamin D levels. The moderate-to-severe clinical group had significantly higher inflammation markers (CRP, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a lower lymphocyte count compared to both the mild and asymptomatic groups. The 25 OH vitamin D levels were also significantly lower (p < 0.001), and the ratio of vitamin D deficiency was 70.6% in the moderate-to-severe group. The vitamin D-deficient group had a significantly higher age and fibrinogen levels while also having a lower lymphocyte count compared to the insufficient and normal groups. The 25 OH vitamin D level was correlated positively with the lymphocyte count (r = 0.375, p = <0.001), and negatively with age (r = -0.496, p = <0.001), CRP (r = -0.309, p = 0.002) and fibrinogen levels (r = -0.381, p = <0.001). In a logistic regression analysis, vitamin D deficiency, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels on admission were independent predictors of severe clinical course.Conclusion: This study revealed an association between vitamin D deficiency and clinical severity, in addition to inflammation markers in pediatric COVID-19 cases.

RECENT FINDINGS CHWs are unique members of clinical care teams because of their ability to foster a deep trust and understanding with patients by sharing similar life experiences, participating in home visits, and providing constant support and advocacy. By partnering with CHWs, other clinical care members also gain a better understanding of their patients allowing them to deliver more culturally competent, patient/family-centered care. CHWs when incorporated into interdisciplinary teams have shown to lower healthcare costs, reduce hospital stays and admissions, and improve health outcomes and quality of life for children and families. However, the lack of standardization among CHW programs makes it difficult to quantify the overall effect and impact of integrating CHWs into clinical care teams. SUMMARY CHWs are able to improve health outcomes and address social determinants of health when properly integrated into clinical care teams. However, without adequate support, integration, funding, and training, CHWs are not able to reach their full potential. The standardization of CHWs' responsibilities and training, like other clinical care team members, is lacking within the United States, making it a challenge to evaluate programs and maintain sustainable funding for these vital members of the clinical care team.","output":"Community health workers: improving population health through integration into healthcare systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the unaccompanied minors' reasons for consulting and their health problems managed in a permanence of access to health care (PASS) at the Hospices civils de Lyon.

Current research indicates long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) may play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. However, the molecular mechanism of lncRNA in endometriosis is far from clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The lncRNA and mRNA expression of 8 patients with ovarian endometriosis were determined by high-throughput RNA sequencing (8 ectopic endometria samples vs 8 eutopic endometria samples), and miRNA expression profiles were obtained from our previous study. Then a lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed by combining the regulatory interaction and negative co-expression interaction between the differentially expressed lncRNAs/mRNAs and miRNAs by different rules. RESULTS: The constructed lncRNA-related ceRNA network was composed of two separate networks, network 1 including 14,137 dysregulated lncRNACmRNA interactions, referring to 242 lncRNAs, 55 miRNAs and 1600 mRNAs, network 2 including 4459 dysregulated lncRNACmRNA interactions, referring to 111 lncRNAs, 39 miRNAs and 1151 mRNAs. The top six hub lncRNAs (LINC01140, MSC-AS1, HAGLR, CKMT2-AS1, JAKMIP2-AS1, AL365361.1) in the significant ternary relationship of mRNACmiRNAClncRNA in network 1, and the top six hub lncRNAs (PAX8-AS1, MIR17HC, PART1, HOXA-AS3, PLAC4, LINC00511) in the significant ternary relationship of mRNACmiRNAClncRNA in network 2 were selected. Functional enrichment analysis of these lncRNA-related mRNAs indicated that the lncRNAs in network 1 mainly take part in positive regulation of phagocytosis, myeloid leukocyte activation, and tissue remodeling, while the lncRNAs in network 2 mainly take part in negative regulation of cell proliferation, blood vessel development and regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, which is consistent with the results obtained from the different rules to construct the networks. CONCLUSION: lncRNA-related ceRNA network analysis recognized key lncRNAs related to the development of endometriosis.","output":"Exploring the Potential Key IncRNAs with Endometriosis by Construction of a ceRNA Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organoids are three-dimensional self-organizing structures formed by adult tissue stem cells or pluripotent stem cells.

Assessment of the efficacy of these measures must be rapid as well. In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R up to the last observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R > or = 1.1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70% of the epidemics, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R = 0.5), this situation may be evidenced in 68% of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92% of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5% probability of a wrong conclusion.","output":"Estimating in real time the efficacy of measures to control emerging communicable diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients run a high risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19, with reported mortality around 19%.

This model adjusts the intersection traffic signal timing intelligence according to the real-time traffic flow and carries out simulation experiments with MATLAB. Compared with the traditional timing schemes, the average delay time of vehicles is reduced by 10.25%, the average number of stops of vehicles is reduced by 24.55%, and the total traffic capacity of the intersection is increased by 3.56%, which verifies that the scheme proposed in this paper is effective in relieving traffic congestion.","output":"How to Improve Urban Intelligent Traffic?

The results show a significant increase in WOB due to face masks, which is more severe in higher activity levels. The added WOB is considerable during physical activity and may be intolerable for patients with preexisting lung disease and may contribute to inspiratory muscle fatigue and dyspnea. Moreover, in this study, the effects of the physical properties of a fibrous medium, including thickness, porosity, and fiber diameter, are analyzed on the particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and the added WOB.

To understand the impact of autophagy modulation on a rainbow trout gill cell line, RTgill-W1, treatments including reduced nutrition (2% fetal bovine serum compared with 10% control), rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, deoxynivalenol, and chloroquine were tested. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of 10 autophagy-related genes. At 3-d post-treatment, reduced nutrition significantly (p < 0.05) increased autophagy while deoxynivalenol significantly (p < 0.01) suppressed it compared to controls. These phenomena were confirmed by using immunofluorescence to detect the number of autophagosomes in RTgill-W1. Chloroquine is critical to allow observation of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein in this model. The commonly used autophagy-modulating chemicals rapamycin and 3-methyladenine either activated or suppressed microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein, respectively, as expected from the literature, but did not act in a consistently significant manner. Expression of five of the 10 Atg genes, including lc3, gabarap, atg4, atg7, and atg12, were altered in a similar pattern to microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain protein.

METHODS Sixty subjects recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 were included. One group of 30 followed a standard recovery management while 30 comparable subjects received a supplement of 150 mg Pycnogenol? daily (in 3 doses of 50 mg) in addition to standard management. RESULTS Two groups of selected subjects were comparable at baseline. The groups progressively improved both with the SM (standard management) and with the SM in combination with the supplement. Patients, supplemented with Pycnogenol? showed significantly better improvement compared to the control group patients. No side effects from the supplementation were observed; tolerability was optimal. The progressive evolution over time was visible in all target measurements. Physiological tests. Endothelial function, low in all subjects at inclusion was assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and finger reactive hyperemia in the microcirculation (laser Doppler measurements) after the release of an occluding suprasystolic cuff). It was significantly improved in the Pycnogenol? group after one month and after 3 months (p<0.05 vs controls). The rate of ankle swelling (RAS) by strain gauge decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) in comparison with controls showing an improvement of the capillary filtration rate. At inclusion, the kidney cortical flow velocity indicated a decrease in perfusion (lower systolic and diastolic flow velocity) in all patients. Kidney cortical flow velocity increased significantly with the supplement (p<0.05) in comparison with controls with improvement in systolic velocity and in diastolic component. High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and Il-6 plasma levels decreased progressively over 3 months with a significant more pronounced decrease in the supplement group (p<0.05). The number of patients with normal plasma IL-6 levels at the end of the study was higher (p<0,05) with the supplement. ESR followed the same pattern with a progressive and a more significant decrease in the supplemented subjects (p<0.02). Oxidative stress decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) compared with the control group. Blood pressure and heart rate were normalized in all subjects in the supplement group; systolic pressure was significantly lower in the supplemented group (p<0,05) at the end of the study. Finally, the scores of Quality-of-life, mood and fatigue questionnaire and the Karnofsky scale performance index significantly improved in the supplement group (p<0.05) compared to controls after 1 and 3 months. All other blood parameters (including platelets and clotting factors) were within normal values at the end of the study.

In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO's singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management.

The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60-93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests.

Dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in patients with cystic fibrosis elevates intracellular Cl- levels ([Cl-]i) and enhanced platelet hyperactivity. In this study, we explored whether alteration of [Cl-]i has a pathological role in regulating platelet hyperactivity and arterial thrombosis formation. CFTR expression was significantly decreased, while [Cl-]i was increased in platelets from CAD patients. In a FeCl3-induced mouse mesenteric arteriole thrombosis model, platelet-specific Cftr-knockout and/or pre-administration of ion channel inhibitor CFTRinh-172 increased platelet [Cl-]i, which accelerated thrombus formation, enhanced platelet aggregation and ATP release, and increased P2Y12 and PAR4 expression in platelets. Conversely, Cftr-overexpressing platelets resulted in subnormal [Cl-]i, thereby decreasing thrombosis formation. Our results showed that clamping [Cl-]i at high levels or Cftr deficiency-induced [Cl-]i increasement dramatically augmented phosphorylation (Ser422) of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1), subsequently upregulated P2Y12 and PAR4 expression via NF-B signaling. Constitutively active mutant S422D SGK1 markedly increased P2Y12 and PAR4 expression. The specific SGK1 inhibitor GSK-650394 decreased platelet aggregation in wildtype and platelet-specific Cftr knockout mice, and platelet SGK1 phosphorylation was observed in line with increased [Cl-]i and decreased CFTR expression in CAD patients. Co-transfection of S422D SGK1 and adenovirus-induced CFTR overexpression in MEG-01 cells restored platelet activation signaling cascade. Our results suggest that [Cl-]i is a novel positive regulator of platelet activation and arterial thrombus formation via the activation of a [Cl-]i-sensitive SGK1 signaling pathway. Therefore, [Cl-]i in platelets is a novel potential biomarker for platelet hyperactivity, and CFTR may be a potential therapeutic target for platelet activation in CAD.","output":"Platelet CFTR inhibition enhances arterial thrombosis via increasing intracellular Cl- concentration and activation of SGK1 signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If the COVID-19 pandemic is an uphill slope, antimicrobial resistance is a steep mountainside.

We addressed this question by conducting a Pavlovian reward conditioning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). In the Pavlovian reward conditioning task, we recorded liking ratings, skin conductance response (SCR), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward (CS+) and neutral (CS-) cues. Typical patterns of reward acquisition and extinction training were observed for liking ratings. There was evidence for conditioning in SCR during the extinction training phase but not the acquisition training phase. However, no evidence of conditioning in either the acquisition or extinction training phase was observed for the corrugator supercilii. IU was not related to any measures during the acquisition or extinction training phases. Taken together, these results suggest that the current Pavlovian reward conditioning task was not sufficient for eliciting a reliable conditioned reward response, and therefore further research with optimised reward conditioning designs are required to test whether IU-related deficits occur during the extinction of reward.","output":"The role of intolerance of uncertainty in the acquisition and extinction of reward."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Pulmonary function abnormalities have been known to last for months or even years in recovered survivors from previous coronavirus pneumonias. However, the long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking, particularly in low-medium income countries. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to describe changes in persistent symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities at approximately two and four months of follow-up. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study in patients recovering from COVID-19. Patients were evaluated in the pulmonary function laboratory at approximately two and fourth months following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. During the follow-up visits, patients were asked to report all persistent symptoms at the time of testing from a list currently recognized as part of post COVID syndrome. They then underwent a standardized 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and pulmonary function testing, which included spirometry and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Patients were excluded if they were unable to complete all pulmonary function tests in the two follow-up visits. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test were used where appropriate to compare anthropometric, pulmonary function, symptoms, and 6MWT variables between follow-up visits. Results: A total of 30 COVID-19 confirmed patients were included for the follow-up evaluation. The median time from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to follow-up was 54 days (IQR: 47-70 days) for the first visit and 120 days (IQR: 111-135 days) for the second visit. Although symptoms persisted at the second follow-up visit, the majority of persistent symptoms improved compared to the first visit (Table 1). There was also a marked improvement in the median number of symptoms at the second compared to the first follow-up visit (2 vs. 4 symptoms, respectively, p=0.003). There was a significant improvement in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, DLCO, and the proportion of patients with a persistent restrictive pattern on spirometry (Table 1). Despite improvements in pulmonary function, there was no significant change in 6-minute walk distance, although there was a significant improvement in end exercise SpO2. Conclusions: A significant proportion of patients in this study showed improvements in persistent symptoms and pulmonary function at 120 days compared to 54 days following the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms.

Diabetes mellitus is a very common disease, and diabetic complications are very common complications. The dry mouth symptom is one of the most common oral complaints in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is thought to promote hyposalivation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the improvement effect of polydatin on diabetes-induced hyposalivation in db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes. We examined salivary flow rate, TUNEL assay, PAS staining, and immunohistochemical staining for AGEs, RAGE, HMGB1, 8-OHdG, and AQP5 to evaluate the efficacy of polydatin in the submandibular salivary gland. Diabetic db/db mice had a decreased salivary flow rate and salivary gland weight. The salivary gland of the vehicle-treated db/db mice showed an increased apoptotic cell injury. The AGEs were highly accumulated, and its receptor, RAGE expression was also enhanced. Expressions of HMGB1, an oxidative cell damage marker, and 8-OHdG, an oxidative DNA damage marker, increased greatly. However, polydatin ameliorated this hypofunction of the salivary gland and inhibited diabetes-related salivary cell injury. Furthermore, polydatin improved mucin accumulation, which is used as a damage marker for salivary gland acinar cells, and decreased expression of water channel AQP5 was improved by polydatin. In conclusion, polydatin has a potent protective effect on diabetes-related salivary gland hypofunction through its antioxidant and anti-glycation activities, and its AQP5 upregulation.

Willingness to undertake extreme acts was assessed in several ways: a measure of willingness to fight for the group, adaptations of the trolley dilemma and questions regarding political violence. Individual construing was examined using repertory grid technique and a semi-structured interview. Results were similar for both Leave and Remain participants. The majority of activists identified as fused to their group and, if so, were more likely to undertake hypothetical extreme behavior compared to those who did not identify as fused. Repertory grid technique indicated that becoming an activist provided individuals with a clearer and more positive view of themselves. Opposition activists were construed more negatively and extremely than fellow activists, and this construal was associated with an increased willingness to undertake extreme pro-group behavior. This was consistent with the personal construct model of radicalization and was heightened in those who were fused. Interview data provided support for the constructivist model and revealed characteristics and concerns of the two groups.

According to WHO(World Health Organization)'s situation report published on May 18th, 2020, COVID-19 has already affected 4,600,000 cases and 310,000 deaths globally and still increasing. The most severe problem of COVID-19 virus is that it spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, which occurs in everyday life. And also, at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.Because of the secure diffusion method and the absence of a vaccine, it is essential to self-diagnose or do a self-diagnosis questionnaire whenever possible. But self-diagnosing has too many questions, and ambiguous standards also take time. Therefore, in this study, using SVM(Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and correlation analysis found two vital factors to predict the infection of the COVID19 virus with an accuracy of 80%. Applying the result proposed in this paper, people can self-diagnose quickly to prevent COVID-19 and further prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"A Study on Self-Diagnosis Method to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 Based on SVM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) significantly affected many people worldwide, especially those with underlying diseases. While some people with underlying illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, are more vulnerable to develop severe COVID-19, other populations, including people who have autoimmune diseases, may develop severe diseases similar to the general population. The severity and outcome of COVID-19 are reviewed in individuals with underlying viral diseases, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis, however, some infectious diseases, including human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) diseases, is under-reported in the literature. HTLV-1 is a sexually transmitted disease that is endemic in some parts of the world. Infected patients may develop clinical symptoms of HTLV-1 associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T cell leukemia (ATL) or may remain asymptomatic during their life. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical studies evaluate the severity and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HTLV-1 infected patients. We aimed to review the pathogenesis of both of these viral infections and discuss their similarities in provoking immune responses. Although HTLV-1 infected patients may have had variable degrees of inflammation and immune system dysregulation, the available data is limited to conclude that HTLV-1 infected patients may be more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19 in contrast to the general population.","output":"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 and novel Coronavirus Disease 2019; More complex than just a simple coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host genetics is a key determinant of COVID-19 outcomes. Previously, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative genome-wide association study used common variants to identify multiple loci associated with COVID-19 outcomes. However, variants with the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes are expected to be rare in the population. Hence, studying rare variants may provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, thereby informing therapeutics development. Here, we combined whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing from 21 cohorts across 12 countries and performed rare variant exome-wide burden analyses for COVID-19 outcomes. In an analysis of 5,048 severe disease cases and 571,009 controls, we observed that carrying a rare deleterious variant in the SARS-CoV-2 sensor toll-like receptor TLR7 (on chromosome X) was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in severe disease (95% CI: 2.75-10.05, p=5.41x10-7).

Here, we report 14 newly evolved COVID-19 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles those underwent a rapid increase (12 cases) or decrease (2 cases) in their frequency from between 10% and 50% in the last three months. The 14 SNPs are mostly (13/14) located in the coding region and are mainly (9/14) nonsynonymous substitutions. Out of the 14 SNPs, 12 SNPs showed a complete linkage in SNP pairs and clustered into 4 linkage groups, named LG_1 to LG_4. SNPs located in 514 and 27046 are independent events. Analyses in population genetics show that the increases in the new alleles result from genetic differentiation between Europe and America. We found that the mutants in LG_1 are driven by balancing selection and arose rapidly in Europe but not in America. The mutants in LG_2 and LG_3, also driven by balancing selection, arose rapidly in American but not in European strains. Based on analysis of geographic COVID-19 cases worldwide, we found that the mutants in LG_1 positively correlate the fatality rate of COVID-19 while those in LG_2 and LG_3 negatively correlate with the fatality rate. The correlations are statistically significant, suggesting that the virus strains possessing mutants in LG_1 are more aggressive, while those in LG_2 and LG_3 are in opposite. Further analysis revealed that mutants in LG_1 have been identified more frequently in European strains than in American strains, while mutants in LG_2 and LG_3 have been found more frequently in American strains. This may partially explain the higher fatality rates of COVID-19 infection in Italy, England and France, compared with the United States.

A genetically encoded biosensor for the detection of As(3+) could potentially facilitate the investigation of such toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we designed and developed two prototype genetically encoded arsenic biosensors (GEARs), based on a bacterial As(3+) responsive transcriptional factor AfArsR from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. We constructed FRET-based GEAR biosensors by insertion of AfArsR between FP acceptor/donor FRET pairs. We further designed and engineered single FP-based GEAR biosensors by insertion of AfArsR into GFP. These constructs represent prototypes for a new family of biosensors based on the ArsR transcriptional factor scaffold.

Virus cellular egress, when fully understood, may be a relevant target for antiviral therapies, which could minimize the public health impact of these infections. In this review, we outline lytic and non-lytic cell egress mechanisms of non-enveloped enteric RNA viruses belonging to five families: Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Astroviridae and Hepeviridae. We discuss factors that contribute to egress mechanisms and the relevance of these mechanisms to virion stability, infectivity and transmission.

Students' presence in the operating theater and on wards is reduced to a bare minimum and face-to-face teaching is diminished. Aim of this study was therefore to evaluate alternative but feasible educational concepts, such as an online-only-platform for undergraduates. OBJECTIVE: A new online platform for undergraduate surgical education was implemented. A virtual curriculum for online-only education was designed. METHODS: A video-based online platform was designed. Following this, a cohort of medical students participating in a (voluntary) surgical course was randomized into a test and control group. Prior to conducting a written exam, students in the test group prepared using the video platform. Students in the control group prepared with standard surgical text books. Results of the exam were used to compare educational means. RESULTS: Students in the test group preparing through the video-based online platform reached significantly higher scores in the written exams (p = 0.0001) than students of the control group. A trend towards reduced preparation time that did not reach statistical significance was detectable in the test group (p = 0.090). Scores of \\"perceived workload\\" and \\"desire to become a surgeon\\" offered no differences between the groups. (p = 0.474 and 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: An online-only, virtual curriculum proved feasible for surgical education in undergraduates. While blended learning concepts were applied in both groups, only the test group had access to case-based videos of surgical procedures and scored significantly better in the written exams. Thus, video-based virtual education offers a realistic alternative to face-to-face teaching or conventional text books in times of restricted access to the operating theatre.","output":"Development of a tailor-made surgical online learning platform, ensuring surgical education in times of the COVID19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To describe our experience with the implementation and refinement of an enhanced recovery programme (ERP) for radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion.

Sensitivity of RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) testing is presumed to be high, but there is no gold standard against which this has been determined. The objective was to determine whether lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurs in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with clinical testing of both specimen types. METHODS: Between March 26, 2020 and April 17, 2020 at the University of Washington Medical Center all patients with BALF specimens clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. We assessed the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in BALF after negative NP testing. We describe 3 cases with positive testing in BALF. RESULTS: Among 16 patients with BALF samples, 3 cases (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in BALF. In Case 1, negative NP testing occurred early in the infection and respiratory symptoms may have been missed due to neurologic injury. In Case 2, outpatient diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia, but clinical suspicion remained high for COVID-19 at hospitalization based on epidemiological and clinical features. All 3 cases involved older adults (age >65 years), one of whom was immunosuppressed in the setting of lung transplantation (Case 3).

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed of the following databases: PubMed, Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, MEDLINE Complete, and SocINDEX. The last date of our search was November 2, 2020. We included all cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and used the Joanna Briggs Institute tool to assess their quality. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled prevalence of mental health problems using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic and Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS A total of 38 studies were identified that reported the mental health problems of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of healthcare workers analyzed in this review included 27.9% doctors, 43.7% nurses, and 7.0% allied health workers. The pooled prevalence of mental health problems for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and distress was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-75%), 40% (95% CI: 29-52%), 37% (95% CI: 29-45%), and 37% (95% CI: 25-50%), respectively.

Post-traumatic stress disorder was the most common mental health disorder reported by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by anxiety, depression, and distress. Additional studies remain necessary to assess the appropriate management strategies for treating and preventing mental health disorders among healthcare workers during the pandemic.","output":"Global prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global threat and remains a significant cause of hospitalizations. Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each treatment. FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: Machine-learning methods have the capacity to identify hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time. These methods may help to improve patient outcomes and allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Machine Learning as a Precision-Medicine Approach to Prescribing COVID-19 Pharmacotherapy with Remdesivir or Corticosteroids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted routine health care services including immunization delivery. The most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States is the human papillomavirus (HPV), and its sequelae may be prevented by vaccination. Sequelae that can develop if one's immune system is not able to clear the infection include warts, precancerous lesions, and cancer. The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ACOG) reports almost everyone who is sexually active will encounter the virus at some time during their life. Most of the estimated 79 million infections occur among people who are in their late teens or early 20s. Since 2006, there has been a vaccine available to prevent HPV infections in both males and females; however, administration of this vaccine has only been about half the rate of other vaccines and vaccine hesitancy may play a role. Public health nurses are vital in providing accurate and nonjudgmental vaccine education to their clients, especially unaccompanied minors seeking care in public health department clinics.

Subsequently, unvalidated and increasingly unrestricted clinical utilization of PGT-A called for at least one properly randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess cumulative live birth rates following a single oocyte retrieval, utilizing all fresh and frozen embryos of an IVF cycle. Only recently two such RCTs were published, however both, when properly analysed, not only failed to demonstrate significant advantages from utilization of PGT-A, but actually demonstrated outcome deficits in comparison to non-use of PGT-A, when patient selection biases in favour of PGT-A were reversed. Moreover, because of high embryo mosaicism at the blastocyst stage and, therefore, high false-positive rates from trophectoderm biopsies, large numbers of chromosomal-normal embryos with normal pregnancy potential are unnecessarily left unused or discarded, indisputably causing harm to affected couples. We, therefore, strongly call for restricting PGT-A to only research protocols and, as of this point in time, encourage professional societies in the field to follow suit with appropriate practice guidelines.","output":"We have reached a dead end for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major healthcare threat Current method of detection involves qPCR-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity False negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission We here aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19 METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 including IgA, IgM and IgG response were examined by using an ELISA based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein Total 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but had typical manifestation) The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection were 5 days (IQR 3-6), while IgG was detected on 14 days (IQR 10-18) after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85 4%, 92 7% and 77 9% respectively In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75 6% and 93 1%, respectively The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR method after 5 5 days of symptom onset The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98 6%) when combined IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compare with a single qPCR test (51 9%) CONCLUSIONS: Humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases","output":"Profiling Early Humoral Response to Diagnose Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2019-nCov), which was first detected in Wuhan/China in December 2019 and spread to the whole world in a short time, was explained as a new coronavirus by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020.

Within a week a monolayer of epithelial cells with interspersed ciliated cells surrounded each fragment. Epithelial monolayers were exposed to 10(3) to 10(4) TCID50/ml of each virus; unattached virus was removed after 3 h. Replication of virus was examined by doing viral titrations of the media daily, and ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells in the monolayer were examined morphologically with an inverted microscope. The peak titer of rhinovirus and coronavirus occurred 24 to 48 h after inoculation, indicating that viral replication was occurring. However, no detectable damage or cytopathic effect (CPE) developed in the monolayer of epithelial cells when compared with that in uninfected control cells. In contrast, infection of epithelial monolayers with influenza or adenovirus resulted in CPE and destruction of the monolayer. The marked difference in the effect of these respiratory viruses on nasal epithelial cells may reflect similar differences in their effect on respiratory tract mucosa in the intact host.

METHODS Observational, retrospective, and descriptive study of patients hospitalized due to ALRTI comparing 2019 and 2020. RESULTS In 2020, the rate of hospitalization due to ALRTI decreased by 73%. In 2019, 517 patients with ALRTI were hospitalized; the following viruses were identified in 174: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (71.2%), adenovirus (AV) (10.3%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) (9.7%), and influenza virus (FLU) (8.6%). In 2020, 94 patients with ALRTI were hospitalized. Until epidemiological week (EW) 13, cases of ALRTI due to PIV and AV were recorded; in EW 29, there was 1 case of bronchiolitis due to AV and rhinovirus (RV), followed by isolated cases of RV; no ALRTI due to RSV or FLU was recorded. In total, 9 cases of ALRTI due to COVID-19 were recorded: 2 moderate bronchiolitis and 7 focal pneumonia; 1 adolescent with comorbidities died due to COVID-19 pneumonia. In 2020, patients were older and had more comorbidities and prior hospitalizations compared to 2019. Focal pneumonia prevailed.

Attention initially focused on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. While general practice has seen a rapid uptake of technology to allow for virtual consultations, little is known about the pattern of suspected COVID-19 presentations in primary care. AIM To quantify the prevalence and time course of clinically suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices, to report the risk of suspected COVID-19 by ethnic group, and to identify whether differences by ethnicity can be explained by clinical data in the GP record. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of approximately 1.2 million adults registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups. The study population includes 55% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. METHOD Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified clinically and recorded using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included data on 16 long-term conditions, body mass index, and smoking status. RESULTS GPs recorded 8985 suspected COVID-19 cases between 10 February and 30 April 2020.Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in the odds of suspected COVID-19 for South Asian and black adults compared with white adults. In a fully adjusted analysis that included clinical factors, South Asian patients had nearly twice the odds of suspected infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83 to 2.04). The OR for black patients was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.38 to 1.57).

However, assays performed on multi-cellular samples lose information about the cell source of the biomarker signal. This cross-sectional study examines whether a bespoke artificial intelligence-based computational pathology tool could ascertain the cellular origin of microRNA biomarkers, to inform interpretation of the disease pathology, and confirm biomarker validity. METHODS The microRNA expression profiles of 110 targets were assessed with a custom multiplexed panel in a cohort of 117 individuals with reflux that took a Cytosponge test. A computational pathology tool quantified the amount of columnar epithelium present in pathology slides, and results were correlated with microRNA signals. An independent cohort of 139 Cytosponges, each from an individual patient, was used to validate the findings via qPCR. FINDINGS Seventeen microRNAs are upregulated in BE compared to healthy squamous epithelia, of which 13 remain upregulated in dysplasia. A pathway enrichment analysis confirmed association to neoplastic and cell cycle regulation processes. Ten microRNAs positively correlated with columnar epithelium content, with miRNA-192-5p and -194-5p accurately detecting the presence of gastric cells (AUC 0.97 and 0.95). In contrast, miR-196a-5p is confirmed as a specific BE marker. INTERPRETATION Computational pathology tools aid accurate cellular attribution of molecular signals.

Here, we have highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory bulb. From the olfactory bulb, SARS-CoV-2 may target the deeper parts of the brain including the thalamus and brainstem by trans-synaptic transfer described for many other viral diseases. Following this, the virus might infect the respiratory center of brain, which could be accountable for the respiratory breakdown of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to screen the COVID-19 patients for neurological symptoms as well as possibility of the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem should be investigated in depth.","output":"Is the Collapse of the Respiratory Center in the Brain Responsible for Respiratory Breakdown in COVID-19 Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When romantic partners personal goals conflict, this can negatively affect personal goal outcomes, such as progress.

Survey participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and interview participants (n = 48) attended a semi-structured interview. Results showed that higher goal conflict was associated with lower goal outcomes, and successful negotiation of goal conflict was associated with better goal outcomes. Qualitative analyses identified three goal conflict negotiation strategies (compromise, integration, concession). Conversations focused on both practical and emotional needs and included respectful communication and space from conflict (timeout or avoidance).

More knowledge is needed regarding the cell type-specific cytopathology and its impact on cellular tropism. Furthermore, the impact of novel SARS-CoV-2 mutations on cellular tropism, alternative routes of entry, the impact of co-infections, and virus replication kinetics along the respiratory tract remains to be explored in improved models. Most applied virology models are not well suited to address the remaining questions, as they do not recapitulate the histoarchitecture and cellular composition of human respiratory tissues. The overall aim of this work was to establish from single biopsy specimens, a human adult stem cell-derived organoid model representing the upper respiratory airways and lungs and explore the applicability of this model to study respiratory virus infection. First, we characterized the organoid model with respect to growth pattern and histoarchitecture, cellular composition, and functional characteristics. Next, in situ expression of viral entry receptors, including influenza virus-relevant sialic acids and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were confirmed in organoids of bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation. We further showed successful infection by pseudotype influenza A H7N1 and H5N1 virus, and the ability of the model to support viral replication of influenza A H7N1 virus. Finally, successful infection and replication of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed in the organoids by TCID50 assay and immunostaining to detect intracellular SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid and dsRNA. The prominent syncytia formation in organoid tissues following SARS-CoV-2 infection mimics the findings from infected human tissues in situ. We conclude that the human organotypic model described here may be particularly useful for virology studies to evaluate regional differences in the host response to infection. The model contains the various cell types along the respiratory tract, expresses respiratory virus entry factors, and supports successful infection and replication of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the model may serve as a relevant and reliable tool in virology and aid in pandemic preparedness, and efficient evaluation of antiviral strategies.","output":"Human Organotypic Airway and Lung Organoid Cells of Bronchiolar and Alveolar Differentiation Are Permissive to Infection by Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until now, there are no approved treatment against COVID-19.

From a cardiological perspective, there have been concerns that the pandemic may have impacted the management of the most acute cardiovascular conditions. Purpose:We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Switzerland by assessing a range of quality-of-care metrics during the first year of the pandemic, as compared with the preceding year. Methods: Data on STEMI patients hospitalised in Switzerland from 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2020 were obtained from the Acute Myocardial Infarction in Switzerland (AMIS) registry. Symptom-to-firstmedical- contact (symptom-to-FMC) time, symptom-to-door time, and doorto- balloon (DTB) time were compared between 2020 and 2019 in an analysis by year and by month. Additionally, rates of in-hospital all-cause mortality and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: all-cause mortality, MI, stroke) were compared. Results: Data on 2192 STEMI patients were available. Compared with the preceding 12 months, the first year of the pandemic was not associated with a significant change in median symptom-to-FMC time (2020: 90 minutes vs 2019: 95 minutes, p=0.32) or median symptom-to-door time (2020: 145 min vs 2019: 157 min, p=0.51). In 2020, February (start of the pandemic) and March (start of national lockdown) were associated with increased DTB times as compared with the same months of 2019 (+7 minutes, +10 minutes, respectively). However, overall median door-toballoon times remained stable (2020: 40 min vs 2019: 39 min, p=0.06). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (2020: 95.6% vs 2019: 95.1%, p=0.54). Finally, there were no significant differences in median length of stay (2020: 4 days vs 2019: 157 min, p=0.51), in-hospital all-cause mortality (2020: 4.9% vs. 2019: 4.2%, p=0.41) or MACE (2020: 6.2% vs. 2019: 5.6%, p=0.52). Conclusions: Although there are some limitations associated with the present study inherent to its retrospective observational design (for instance, a potentially important number of late comers may not have been included in the registry), the data suggest that despite the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare system in Switzerland in 2020, STEMI management as defined by a range of quality-of-care metrics remained effective and efficient.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and outcomes of STEMI patients in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Geographic information systems (GIS) are often used to examine the association between both physical activity and nutrition environments, and children's health. It is often assumed that geospatial datasets are accurate and complete. Furthermore, GIS datasets regularly lack metadata on the temporal specificity. Data is usually provided 'as is', and therefore may be unsuitable for retrospective or longitudinal studies of health outcomes. In this paper we outline a practical approach to both fill gaps in geospatial datasets, and to test their temporal validity. This approach is applied to both district council and open-source datasets in the Taranaki region of Aotearoa New Zealand. METHODS: We used the 'streetview' python script to download historic Google Street View (GSV) images taken between 2012 and 2016 across specific locations in the Taranaki region. Images were reviewed and relevant features were incorporated into GIS datasets. RESULTS: A total of 5166 coordinates with environmental features missing from council datasets were identified. The temporal validity of 402 (49%) environmental features was able to be confirmed from council dataset considered to be 'complete'. A total of 664 (55%) food outlets were identified and temporally validated. CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicates that geospatial datasets are not always complete or temporally valid.

RESULTS: Our study showed the increased effectiveness of an alternative topical therapy for affected animals using the mycoparasitic fungus Pythium oligandrum, which is gentler and cheaper than the standard systemic treatment with itraconazole, and which can also be easily used as a preventative treatment. A decrease in the number of M. canis colonies was observed in cats treated with a preparation containing P. oligandrum 2 weeks after the start of therapy (2 cats with P-1 score, 2 cats with P-2 score, 5 cats with P-3 score) compared with the beginning of the study (9 cats with P-3 score = massive infection). The alternative topical therapy with a preparation containing P. oligandrum was significantly more effective compared with the commonly used systemic treatment using itraconazole 5 mg/kg in a 6-week pulse.

We aimed to determine whether DCC compared to immediate cord clamping (ICC) in very preterm infants improves cerebral oxygenation in the first 24 h. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective study of a subset of infants at < 30 weeks of gestation who were randomised to DCC (60 s) or ICC (< 10 s) and required an indwelling arterial catheter. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rScO2), blood pressure, PI, and peripheral saturation were measured and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) calculated for the following 3 time intervals: 3-6, 6-12, and 12-28 h of age. Functional ultrasound measures including superior vena cava flow, right ventricular output, ductus arteriosus size and shunt and anterior cerebral artery resistive index were determined. RESULTS The mean (SD) gestation and birth weight of the 51 study infants were 27  1 weeks and 1,046  241 g respectively. Twenty infants received DCC and 31 received ICC. Baseline demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Comparing DCC and ICC infants, there was no difference in rScO2 or cFTOE at any time point. Three out of 20 infants did not receive DCC due to clinical concerns. A sensitivity analysis revealed that cord clamping 30 s was significantly associated with increased rScO2 and decreased cFTOE at all 3 time points after adjusting for gestation. CONCLUSION Although DCC was not associated with changes in cerebral oxygenation overall, sensitivity analysis suggested a possible effect of an increased rScO2 and a decreased cFTOE with 30 s of DCC.","output":"Effect of Delayed Cord Clamping on Cerebral Oxygenation in Very Preterm Infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel moral norms peculiar to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in tension between maintaining ones preexisting moral priorities (e.g., loyalty to ones family and human freedoms) and avoiding contraction of the COVID-19 disease and SARS COVID-2 virus. By drawing on moral foundations theory, the current study questioned how the COVID-19 pandemic (or health threat salience in general) affects moral decision making. With two consecutive pilot tests on three different samples (ns  40), we prepared our own sets of moral foundation vignettes which were contextualized on three levels of health threats: the COVID-19 threat, the non-COVID-19 health threat, and no threat. We compared the wrongness ratings of those transgressions in the main study (N = 396, M(age) = 22.47). The results showed that the acceptability of violations increased as the disease threat contextually increased, and the fairness, care, and purity foundations emerged as the most relevant moral concerns in the face of the disease threat. Additionally, participants general binding moral foundation scores consistently predicted their evaluations of binding morality vignettes independent of the degree of the health threat. However, as the disease threat increased in the scenarios, pre-existing individuating morality scores lost their predictive power for care violations but not for fairness violations. The current findings imply the importance of contextual factors in moral decision making. Accordingly, we conclude that people make implicit cost-benefit analysis in arriving at a moral decision in health threatening contexts.

We show that the market underwent a significant structural variation in 2007 just before the global financial crisis.

Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, was evaluated and characterized for its anti-NS5B activity in vitro and in HCV replicon cells. METHODS Recombinant NS5B, HCV replicase and Huh-7 cells harbouring the subgenomic HCV replicon of genotype 1b were employed for biochemical and mechanistic investigations. RESULTS Analysis of ATA activity in vitro yielded equipotent inhibition of recombinant NS5B and HCV replicase in the submicromolar range (50% inhibition concentration [IC(50)] approximately 150 nM). Biochemical and mechanistic studies revealed a bimodal mechanism of ATA inhibition with characteristics of pyrophosphate mimics and non-nucleoside inhibitors. Molecular modelling and competition displacement studies were consistent with these parameters, suggesting that ATA might bind to the benzothiadiazine allosteric pocket 3 of NS5B or at its catalytic centre. Kinetic studies revealed a mixed mode of ATA inhibition with respect to both RNA and UTP substrates. Under single-cycle assay conditions, ATA inhibited HCV NS5B initiation and elongation from pre-bound RNA, but with > or =fivefold decreased potency compared with continuous polymerization conditions. The IC(50) value of ATA for the native replicase complex was 145 nM. In HCV replicon cells, ATA treatment ablated HCV RNA replication (50% effective concentration =75 nM) with concomitant decrease in NS5B expression and no apparent cytotoxic effects.

This review examines the evidence regarding smokers' motivation, dependence and quitting behaviour as smoking prevalence declines, to assess whether population \\"hardening\\" (decreasing propensity to quit) or \\"softening\\" (the converse) is occurring. METHODS: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to July 2019, using terms related to smoking and hardening, for reviews and large, population-based repeat cross-sectional studies. There were additional searches of reference lists and citations of key research articles. Two reviewers screened half the titles and abstracts each, and two reviewers screened full texts independently using tested criteria. Four reviewers independently and systematically extracted data from eligible publications, with one reviewer per study, checked by another reviewer. RESULTS: Of 265 titles identified, three reviews and ten repeat cross-sectional studies were included. Reviews concluded that hardening has not occurred among the general smoking population over time. Among repeated cross-sectional studies, five examined motivation, nine examined dependence, five examined hardcore smoking, and two examined quit outcomes. All but one study found a lack of hardening. Most found softening within the smoking population, consistent across hardening indicators, definitions, countries (and tobacco control environments) and time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco control reduces smoking prevalence and fosters a smoking population more amenable to evidence-based interventions. Based on the weight of the available evidence, the \\"hardening hypothesis\\" should be rejected and the reality of softening accepted. IMPLICATIONS: This umbrella review and systematic review provides a critical consideration of evidence from psychology and other fields regarding the \\"hardening hypothesis\\" - a persistent myth undermining tobacco control. It reaches the conclusion that the sum-total of the world-wide evidence indicates either \\"softening\\" of the smoking population, or a lack of hardening. Hence, tobacco control reduces smoking prevalence and fosters a smoking population more amenable to evidence-based interventions.

Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effect of theory-based education on promoting a healthy lifestyle and fasting blood sugar (FBS) in pre-diabetic women. METHODS: This is a cluster\\\\randomized controlled trial that was performed on 71 pre-diabetic women referred to Arak Comprehensive Health Service Center. Thus, using cluster sampling method, one center was randomly assigned to the intervention group and one center to the control group. The data collection tool was a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and healthy lifestyle behavior that was completed before and at least 3 months after training and FBS test was performed. The experimental group received 3 training sessions of 60 to 90 min and finally the data were analyzed using statistical software. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mean scores of knowledge (P < 0.001), attitude (P = 0.047) and perceived behavioral control related to physical activity (P = 0.046) and dietary function (P = 0.01) increased significantly in the intervention group. In addition, fasting blood sugar in the intervention group (99.70  11.06) improved significantly compared to the control group (110.94  17.09) (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Education based on the theory of planned behavior, by holding face-to-face meetings along with following up the samples after the educational intervention, can promote healthy lifestyle of pre-diabetic women.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). PARTICIPANTS: All veterans receiving VHA healthcare with 1 positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 March 2020 and 10 March 2021 (cases; n=231 154) and a comparator group of controls comprising all veterans who did not have a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 but who did have 1 clinical lab test performed during the same time period (n=4 570 252). MAIN OUTCOMES: Associations of: (1) any statin use, (2) use of specific statins or (3) low-intensity/moderate-intensity versus high-intensity statin use at the time of positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (cases) or result of clinical lab test (controls) assessed from pharmacy records with hospitalisation, ICU admission and death at 30 days. We also examined whether associations differed between individuals with and without a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, statin use was associated with lower odds of death at 30 days (OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.85)) but not with hospitalisation or ICU admission. Associations were similar comparing use of each specific statin to no statin. Compared with low-/moderate intensity statin use, high-intensity statin use was not associated with lower odds of ICU admission or death. Over the same period, associations of statin use with 30-day outcomes were significantly stronger among individuals without a positive test for SARS-CoV-2: hospitalisation OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.80), ICU admission OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.90) and death 0.60 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.62; p for interaction all <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Associations of statin use with lower adverse 30-day outcomes are weaker among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with individuals without a positive test, indicating that statins do not exert SARS-CoV-2 specific effects.","output":"Associations of statin use with 30-day adverse outcomes among 4 801 406 US Veterans with and without SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning in the United States in 2020, SARS-CoV-2 lead to unprecedented changes in the lives of both younger and older people.

In particular, hollow gold nanostructures are highly promising for practical applications, with significant advantages being found in their material properties and structures: 1) the interaction between the outer surface plasmon mode and inner cavity mode leads to a greater resonance, allowing it to absorb near-infrared light, which can readily penetrate tissue; 2) it has anti-corrosiveness and good biocompatibility, which makes it suitable for biomedical applications; 3) it shows a reduced net density and large surface area, allowing the possibility of nanocarriers for drug delivery. In this review, we present information on the classification, characteristics, and synthetic methods of hollow gold nanostructures; discuss the recent advances in hollow gold nanostructures in biomedical applications, including biosensing, bioimaging, photothermal therapy, and drug delivery; and report on the existing challenges and prospects for hollow gold nanostructures.","output":"Recent Advances in Hollow Gold Nanostructures for Biomedical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the panel data of 283 cities in China from 2009 to 2018, this paper analyzes the effect of urban green scientific and technological innovation enhancement on hazardous air pollutants using the GS2SLS method, which simultaneously controls for model endogeneity and spatial spillover effects and reveals the transmission mechanism of urban green scientific and technological innovation level.

This official figure is an underestimate as it excludes anybody who did not die in a hospital, who did not test positive, who had a false result, or those who recovered on their own without a test. Objective: This study aimed to measure the community level excess mortality using health and demographic surveillance in a rural area of Bangladesh. Method: The study was conducted in Matlab, in a rural area of Bangladesh, with a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) covering a population of 239,030 individuals living in 54,823 households in 142 villages. We examined the mortality in January-April from 2015 to 2020 and compared the mortality in 2020 with the historical trend of 2015C2019. Between 2015 and 2020, we followed 276,868 people until migration or death, whichever occurred first. We analyzed mortality using crude mortality rate ratio (MRR) and adjusted MRR (aMRR) from a Cox proportional hazard model. Mortality was analyzed according to age, sex, and period. Results: During follow-up, 3,197 people died. The mortality rate per 1,000 person-years increased from 10 in 2019 to 12 in 2020. Excess mortality was observed among the elderly population (aged 65 years and above). The elderly mortality rate per 1,000 person-years increased from 80 in 2019 to 110 in 2020, and the aMRR was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.19C1.64). Although an increasing tendency in mortality was observed between 2015 and 2019, it was statistically insignificant. Conclusions: The study reported a 28% increase in excess deaths among the elderly population during the first months of the pandemic. This all-cause mortality estimation at the community level will urge policymakers, public health professionals, and researchers to further investigate the causes of death and the underlying reasons for excess deaths in the older age-group.","output":"Insights Into Excess Mortality During the First Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic From a Rural, Demographic Surveillance Site in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The International Journal of Tropical Insect Science (Int J Trop Insect Sci) is a peer-reviewed journal established in 1980 to promote insect science mainly in the tropics.

In addition, adults who want to reduce the risk for becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others should be vaccinated. Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) objectives include increasing vaccination levels to 90% for adults aged > or =65 years (objective 14-29a) and 60% for persons aged 18-64 years who have one or more high-risk conditions (objective 14-29c). From the 1992-93 through 2003-04 influenza seasons, seasonal influenza vaccination coverage estimates (based on Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS] data) among adults aged > or =65 years trended upward, except for three seasons (1997-98, 1999-00, and 2000-01) when no increases occurred (Figure). To evaluate recent state-specific progress toward the HP2010 objectives, CDC compared data from the 2004 and 2006 BRFSS surveys, which reflected vaccinations received during the 2003-04 and 2005-06 influenza seasons; data from the 2004-05 influenza season, which have been published previously, were not included in this comparison because that season was marked by a substantial shortage of influenza vaccine. This report describes the results of the analysis, which indicated that influenza vaccination coverage for the 2005-06 season did not return to levels observed before the vaccine shortage of 2004-05 and remained substantially below HP2010 targets.

Methods: A total of 760 patients with a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 were recruited between 1 January and 30 June 2021. Patients were grouped by age; sex; and common morbidities, such as atrial fibrillation, chronic respiratory disease, coronary disease, diabetes type II, neoplasia, hypertension and -Thalassemia heterozygosity. As a primary endpoint, we assessed mortality risk from COVID-19, and as secondary endpoints, we considered clinical severity and need for Intense Care Unit (ICU) admission. Results: In multivariate analysis, male sex (p < 0.001, OR = 2.59), increasing age (p < 0.001, OR = 1.049), -Thalassemia heterozygosity (p = 0.001, OR = 2.41) and chronic respiratory disease (p = 0.018, OR = 1.84) were identified as risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19. Moreover, male sex (p < 0.001, OR = 1.98), increasing age (p < 0.001, OR = 1.052) and -Thalassemia heterozygosity (p = 0.001, OR = 2.59) were associated with clinical severity in logistic regression.

The brain hardware upgrade, underlying these observations, includes an EPO induced ~20% increase in pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes in cornu ammonis hippocampi in the absence of elevated DNA synthesis. In parallel, EPO reduces microglia numbers and dampens their activity and metabolism as prerequisites for undisturbed EPO-driven differentiation of pre-existing local neuronal precursors. These processes depend on neuronal and microglial EPOR.

However, there is no clear COVID-19 stage definition, and few studies have addressed characterizing COVID-19 progression, making the need for this study evident. Methods: : We proposed a temporal deep learning method, based on a time-aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM) neural network and used an online open dataset, including blood samples of 485 patients from Wuhan, China, to train the model. Our method can grasp the dynamic relations in irregularly sampled time series, which is ignored by existing works. Specifically, our method predicted the outcome of COVID-19 patients by considering both the biomarkers and the irregular time intervals. Then, we used the patient representations, extracted from T-LSTM units, to subtype the patient stages and describe the disease progression of COVID-19. Results: : Using our method, the accuracy of the outcome of prediction results was more than 90% at 12 days and 98%, 95% and 93% at 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. Most importantly, we found 4 stages of COVID-19 progression with different patient statuses and mortality risks. We ranked 40 biomarkers related to disease and gave the reference values of them for each stage. Top 5 is Lymph, LDH, hs-CRP, Indirect Bilirubin, Creatinine. Besides, we have found 3 complications - myocardial injury, liver function injury and renal function injury. Predicting which of the 4 stages the patient is currently in can help doctors better assess and cure the patient. Conclusions: : To combat the COVID-19 epidemic, this paper aims to help clinicians better assess and treat infected patients, provide relevant researchers with potential disease progression patterns, and enable more effective use of medical resources. Our method predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy and identified a four-stage disease progression. We hope that the obtained results and patterns will aid in fighting the disease.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Disease Progression and Patient Outcomes based on Temporal Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesThe management of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on the approval of safe and effective vaccines but, equally importantly, on high vaccine acceptance among people. To facilitate vaccination acceptance via effective health communication, it is key to understand levels of vaccine skepticism and the demographic, psychological and political predictors. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine.Design, setting and participantsWe examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large online surveys from eight Western democracies that differ in terms of the severity of the pandemic and their response: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States (total N = 18,231). Survey respondents were quota sampled to match the population margins on age, gender, and geographic location for each country. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, allowing us to assess changes in acceptance and predictors as COVID-19 vaccine programs were rolled out. Outcome measureThe outcome of the study is self-reported acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine approved and recommended by health authorities. ResultsThe data reveal large variations in vaccine acceptance that ranges from 82 % in Denmark to 52 % in Hungary. Lack of vaccine acceptance is associated with lack of trust in authorities and scientists, conspiratorial thinking, and a lack of concern about COVID-19. ConclusionMost national levels of vaccine acceptance fall below estimates of the required threshold for herd immunity. The results emphasize the long-term importance of building trust in preparations for health emergencies such as the current pandemic. For health communication, the results emphasize the importance of focusing on personal consequences of infections and debunking of myths to guide communication strategies.","output":"Public Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccines: Cross-National Evidence on Levels and Individual-Level Predictors Using Observational Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major threat to global health1 and the medical countermeasures available so far are limited2,3. Moreover, we currently lack a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-24. Here we analyse a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies that target the spike (S) glycoprotein5, and identify several that exhibit potent neutralizing activity and fully block the receptor-binding domain of the S protein (SRBD) from interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using competition-binding, structural and functional studies, we show that the monoclonal antibodies can be clustered into classes that recognize distinct epitopes on the SRBD, as well as distinct conformational states of the S trimer. Two potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, which recognize non-overlapping sites, bound simultaneously to the S protein and neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus in a synergistic manner. In two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of COV2-2196, COV2-2130 or a combination of both of these antibodies protected mice from weight loss and reduced the viral burden and levels of inflammation in the lungs. In addition, passive transfer of either of two of the most potent ACE2-blocking monoclonal antibodies (COV2-2196 or COV2-2381) as monotherapy protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Recent evidence showed that NS1 is secreted efficiently from infected mosquito cells. To explore the secretory route of NS1 in mosquito cells, infected cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). The results showed that MCD, but not BFA, significantly reduced the release of NS1. Moreover, silencing the expression of caveolin-1 (CAV1; a key component of the caveolar system that transports cholesterol inside the cell), but not SAR1 (a GTPase that participates in the classical secretory pathway), also results in a significant reduction of the secretion of NS1. These results indicate that NS1 is released from mosquito cells via an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi complex, with the participation of CAV1. In agreement with this notion, differences were observed in the glycosylation status between secreted NS1 and E proteins. Classical mechanics and docking simulations suggested highly favoured interactions between the caveolin-binding domain present in NS1 and the scaffolding domain of CAV1. Finally, proximity ligation assays showed direct interaction between NS1 and CAV1 in infected mosquito cells. These findings are in line with the lipoprotein nature of secreted NS1 and provide new insights into the biology of NS1.","output":"The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from infected mosquito cells via a non-classical caveolin-1-dependent pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been widely used for detecting pathogens.

The porosity of the paper enabled the capillary flow of dispersed polydopamine for positive sample, while aggregated polydopamine remained at the bottom of the paper strip due to large size of the aggregates for negative sample. Based on this mechanism, we fabricated a slidable paper device integrating LAMP with dopamine polymerization for the naked-eye detection, operated in a seamless manner. Moreover, the introduced paper device was successfully used to detect DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 within 25 min, as well as Enterococcus faecium within 35 min. The detection limits of both Escherichia coli O157:H7 and SARS-CoV-2 were 10-4 ng/L.

However, no report is currently available regarding the direct effects of HCQ on gut microbiota, which is associated with the outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19. Here, we first investigated the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in mice. MAIN METHODS: Fifteen female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups: HCQ group (n = 10) and control group (n = 5). Mice in the HCQ group were administered with HCQ at dose of 100 mg/kg by gavage daily for 14 days. The feces of mice were collected before and on the 7th and 14th days after HCQ challenge, and then analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. At the end of the experiment, the hematology, serum biochemistry and cytokines were determined, respectively. The mRNA expression of tight junction proteins in colonic tissues were also studied by RT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: HCQ challenge had no effects on the counts of white blood cells, the levels of serum cytokines, and the gene expression of tight junction proteins in colon. HCQ also did not increase the content of serum d-lactate in mice. Notably, HCQ significantly decreased the diversity of gut microbiota, increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes whereas decreased that of Firmicutes.

On average, the number of Coronavirus patients in the world is 136.2 that is 8.6 times more than in Korea. The number of Covid-19 patients recorded in Korea is relatively smaller than other countries. There was no clear evidence on the atmospheric transport of Coronaviruses over 1 km to cause infection to other people. The infection of Coronaviruses appeared to occur mainly by close contact with an infected person or by airborne droplets in confined indoor environments, as noted earlier (Lancet, Respir Med 8(12):1159, 2020). To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus and related infections, the wearing of a pollution filter (mask) covering the nose and mouth is mandatory for Coronavirus patients. For the general public, however, we have invented a filter which covers only the nose. When there is no need for conversation and deep breathing, the nose band would be sufficient to filter out Coronavirus and air pollutants. Meanwhile, air and sea port activities including ground transport continued and strict policy on people mingle was not tightly enforced, and control measures to reduce infection were not so effective. However, it is believed that consuming fermented Korean spicy Kimchee and hot peppery soup plus warm rice tea helps in washing Coronaviruses around the throat deep down to the stomach.

In this cross-sectional study, the hospital records of two thousand, two hundred and seventy eight neonates were analyzed from patients' data register for the year 2020. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel spread sheet. Of 2278 children admitted to the neonatal ward, only 29.2% babies had birth weight within normal range, 0.7% neonates were high birth weight, and the rest of the admitted babies (70.1%) during the year 2020 had birth weight below 2500 grams.

However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is highly heterogeneous and exhibits localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of zero incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, this characteristic burstiness in SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, one can generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with burstiness that over longer times converge to exactly zero VE, but that for interim times frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. For example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, one can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes (VE > 90%, for 94 COVID-19 cases) from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of a RNA based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and in reported cases.","output":"Interim Estimates in Null Models of COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Almost 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 were reported in Brazil in 2020. The case fatality rate of a new infectious disease can vary by different risk factors and over time.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort of all COVID-19-related admissions between epidemiological weeks 10C40 in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) was delimited from available reimbursement records. Smoothing time series and survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the trends of hospital case fatality rates (CFR) and the probability of death according to factors such as sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, length of stay and ICU use. RESULTS: With 398,063 admissions and 86,452 (21.7%) deaths, the overall age-standardized hospital CFR trend decreased throughout the period, varying from 31.8% (95%CI: 31.2 to 32.5%) in week 10 to 18.2% (95%CI: 17.6 to 18.8%) in week 40.

Chemosensory impairments affect physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. The aim of this cohort study was to characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial survey (S1) about respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function and COVID-19 diagnosis between April and September 2020, were invited to complete a follow-up survey (S2). Between September 2020 and February 2021, 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. RESULTS: At follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID illness. The ability to smell during COVID-19 was rated slightly lower by those who did not eventually recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. CONCLUSIONS: While smell ability improves for many individuals who lost it during acute COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is associated with broader persistent symptoms of COVID-19, and may last for many months following acute COVID-19. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that even conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19.

METHODOLOGY: Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID\\\\19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID\\\\19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30\\\\day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression. RESULTS: The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, 2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute\\\\phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2C99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36C129.7); two complications from COVID\\\\19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50C18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01C4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16C2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24C2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11C0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01C2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47C2.95). CONCLUSION: In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID\\\\19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications. There is also the importance of offering additional support to patients with low income and residence in rural areas so that they can have more support during cancer treatment.","output":"Impact of COVID\\\\19 Infection on Patients with Cancer: Experience in a Latin American Country: The ACHOCC\\\\19 Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The tracer method, commonly used for quality assessment, can also be used as a tool for peer observation and formative feedback on professional development. This scoping review describes how, by whom, and with what effect the tracer method is applied as a formative professional development instrument between healthcare professionals of equal status and aims to identify the types of scientific evidence for this use of the tracer method. METHODS The authors searched four electronic databases for eligible articles, which were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent researchers. From eligible studies, data were extracted to summarize, collate, and make a narrative account of the findings. RESULTS The electronic search yielded 1757 unique studies, eight of which were included as valid and relevant to our aim: five qualitative, two mixed methods, and one quantitative study. Seven studies took place in hospitals and one in general practice. The tracer method was used mainly as a form of peer observation and formative feedback. Most studies evaluated the tracer method's feasibility and its impact on professional development. All but one study reported positive effects: participants described the tracer method generally as being valuable and worth continuing. DISCUSSION Although the body of evidence is small and largely limited to the hospital setting, using the tracer method for peer observation and formative feedback between healthcare professionals of equal status appears sufficiently useful to merit further rigorous evaluation and implementation in continuous professional development in healthcare.","output":"The application of the tracer method with peer observation and formative feedback for professional development in clinical practice: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enteroviruses are ubiquitous mammalian pathogens that can produce mild to life-threatening disease. We developed a multimodal, rapid, accurate and economical point-of-care biosensor that can detect nucleic acid sequences conserved amongst 96% of all known enteroviruses. The biosensor harnesses the physicochemical properties of gold nanoparticles and oligonucleotides to provide colourimetric, spectroscopic and lateral flow-based identification of an exclusive enteroviral nucleic acid sequence (23 bases), which was identified through in silico screening. Oligonucleotides were designed to demonstrate specific complementarity towards the target enteroviral nucleic acid to produce aggregated goldColigonucleotide nanoconstructs. The conserved target enteroviral nucleic acid sequence (1  10(?7) M, 1.4  10(?14) g/mL) initiates goldColigonucleotide nanoconstruct disaggregation and a signal transduction mechanism, producing a colourimetric and spectroscopic blueshift (544 nm (purple) > 524 nm (red)). Furthermore, lateral-flow assays that utilise goldColigonucleotide nanoconstructs were unaffected by contaminating human genomic DNA, demonstrated rapid detection of conserved target enteroviral nucleic acid sequence (<60 s), and could be interpreted with a bespoke software and hardware electronic interface. We anticipate that our methodology will translate in silico screening of nucleic acid databases to a tangible enteroviral desktop detector, which could be readily translated to related organisms.

METHODS Members of a Norwegian fitness association were invited to fill out an online questionnaire including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), sleep disturbances and change in PA habits (decreased, unchanged, increased) during the COVID-19 lockdown from 12 March to 15 June 2020. RESULTS A sample of 1281 members aged 19-81 years were included (31% females; mean  SD age 49  11.5). Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 9.0% and 4.4%, respectively. During the lockdown period, 13.8% reduced, 21.9% increased and 64.3% did not change PA level. In total 21.9% reported sleeping disturbances. Anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms were statistically significantly associated with sleep disturbances. Change in PA did not influence the association between mental health and sleep. CONCLUSION Compared to studies from the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial lower in this Norwegian sample of relatively physically active adults.

Working areas were categorized into COVID-free areas (wards and ICUs for patients without COVID-19, medical offices, and hospitality counters) and COVID+ areas (dedicated wards and the ICU for patients with COVID-19). From March 1 to 20, 2020, 302 HCPs were tested: 251 (83.1%) responded to the questionnaire, but 9 were excluded since infection occurred outside the hospital. The remaining 242 subjects included 53 (21.9%) with positive NPS and 189 (78.1%) with negative NPS, significant differences in NPS results were evident depending on the subject's role (p = 0.028). Pairwise post hoc analysis revealed that surgeons had a significantly increased rate of positive NPS (p = 0.001). Of the 189 subjects with negative NPS, 175 (92.6%) worked in COVID-free areas, and 14 (7.4%) in COVID+ areas. Of the 53 subjects with positive NPS, 44 (83.1%) worked in COVID-free areas and 9 (16.9%) worked in COVID+ areas.

Children are used to them but they do not know how they are made. Engaging children in the design of smart things can help them learn of them and develop their own. Smart-thing design with children was usually held in person, in informal settings, with a learning by-doing and playful approach, and collaboratively, so as to sustain childrens learning over time. Recently the COVID pandemics has made this type of design with children impossible, e.g., due to physical distancing restrictions. Smart-thing design with children has thus adapted to the mutated settings and moved at a distance. What children can learn when designing at a distance, though, remains an open question. This paper tackles such issue. It reports on at-a-distance design workshops with 20 children, aged 8C16 years old. In this paper, data are processed in relation to childrens learning of smart-thing programming, before and after the workshops. Results indicate that design workshops, held at a distance, can help children learn how to program their own smart thing ideas.

Understanding the genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 is important for recognizing genetic nature and evolutionary aspect of the gene in the natural P. falciparum population and for designing an effective vaccine based on the antigen. METHODS: Blood samples collected from P. falciparum-infected patients in Naung Cho and Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar, in 2015 were used in this study. The pfmsp-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were analysed using the programs DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP 5.10.00. Genetic diversity and natural selection of the global pfmsp-3 were also comparatively analysed. RESULTS: Myanmar pfmsp-3 displayed 2 different alleles, 3D7 and K1. The 3D7 allelic type was predominant in the population, but genetic polymorphism was less diverse than for the K1 allelic type. Polymorphic characters in both allelic types were caused by amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Amino acid substitutions were mainly occurred at the alanine heptad repeat domains, whereas most insertions and deletions were found at the glutamate rich domain. Overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar in the global pfmsp-3 population, but novel amino acid changes were observed in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with low frequencies. Complicated patterns of natural selection and recombination events were predicted in the global pfmsp-3, which may act as major driving forces to maintain and generate genetic diversity of the global pfmsp-3 population. CONCLUSION: Global pfmsp-3 revealed genetic polymorphisms, suggesting that the functional and structural consequences of the polymorphisms should be considered in designing a vaccine based on PfMSP-3.

Few studies have focused on the longitudinal effects of exclusive breastfeeding outcome of preterm infants separated from their mothers after discharge, especially in Shanghai. We aimed to examine the exclusive breastfeeding rate and duration amongst first time mothers of preterm infants after discharge and its determinants. METHODS: Analyses were based on 500 preterm infants separated from their mothers in a tertiary maternity and infant-specialized hospital in Shanghai from September 2018 to September 2019.The Socio-demographic characteristics, breastfeeding knowledge questionnaire, breastfeeding self-efficacy short form scale, Edinburgh postpartum depression scale and breastfeeding family support scale were used for the investigation and the exclusive breastfeeding rate of premature infants was followed up on 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after discharge. The changing trend of breastfeeding knowledge, breastfeeding self-efficacy, postpartum depression and family support were measured by ANOVA at different stages. Using the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression, factors impacting the breastfeeding rate of preterm infants at three time intervals after discharge were investigated. The Kaplan Meier survival curve and cox regression model were used to analyze the determinants of exclusive breastfeeding duration of premature infants after discharge. RESULTS: Exclusive breastfeeding rates were 19.0, 17.2 and 10.4% at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after discharge of preterm infants, respectively. The average length of exclusive breastfeeding duration was(3.69  1.80)months.

We extended the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to include other emerging factors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as risk perception, tourist trust, and charitable attitude. Our findings show that COVID-19 changed respondents' travel preferences in different ways, for example, tend to choose natural/outdoor/uncrowded attractions over cultural/indoor/crowded attractions. Second, respondents' domestic travel behaviors and intentions were positively associated with constructs in TPB, charitable attitude to contribute to the recovery of the tourism industry, tourists' trust in domestic COVID-19 control, and awareness of destinations' promotion strategies, while domestic travel intentions were negatively associated with risk perception. Third, concerns about the international COVID-19 control and travel restrictions were the two major factors affecting residents' intentions to travel abroad.

Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques.

However, the yield of these citrus crops is often reduced due to the damage of various pests and diseases. In order to mitigate these problems, several convolutional neural networks were applied to detect them. It is of note that the performance of these selected models degraded as the size of the target object in the image decreased. To adapt to scale changes, a new feature reuse method named bridge connection was developed. With the help of bridge connections, the accuracy of baseline networks was improved at little additional computation cost. The proposed BridgeNet-19 achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.47%), followed by the pre-trained VGG-19 (95.01%) and VGG-19 with bridge connections (94.73%). The use of bridge connections also strengthens the flexibility of sensors for image acquisition.

There have been studies of patients on in-center hemodialysis (HD), but home dialysis population data are scarce. Our objective is to study the incidence and course of COVID-19 in a home dialysis unit (HDU) at the height of the pandemic. Methods: an observational, retrospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the HDU of Hospital Universitario La Paz [La Paz University Hospital] (Madrid, Spain) between March 10 and May 15, 2020. We collected clinical data from the HDU (57 patients on peritoneal dialysis [PD] and 22 patients on home hemodialysis [HHD]) and compared the clinical characteristics and course of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. Results: twelve patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (9 PD; 3 HHD). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the unit. The mean age was 62  18.5 years; most were men (75%). All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.4  9.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on PD. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed.

We aimed to investigate whether HRV infection induces a specific gene expression pattern in airway epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial cell monolayers were infected with HRV species B (HRV-B). RNA was extracted from both supernatants and infected monolayer cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) and transcriptional profile was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip and the results were subsequently validated using quantitative Real-time PCR method. HRV-B infects alveolar epithelial cells which supports implication of the virus with LRTIs. In total 991 genes were found differentially expressed during the course of infection. Of these, 459 genes were up-regulated whereas 532 genes were down-regulated. Differential gene expression at 6 hpi (187 genes up-regulated vs. 156 down-regulated) were significantly represented by gene ontologies related to the chemokines and inflammatory molecules indicating characteristic of viral infection. The 75 up-regulated genes surpassed the down-regulated genes (35) at 12 hpi and their enriched ontologies fell into discrete functional entities such as regulation of apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, and wound healing. At later time points of 24 and 48 hpi, predominated down-regulated genes were enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and airway remodeling events. Our data provides a comprehensive image of host response to HRV infection.

However, scaling these models to millions of medical concepts entails the creation of much larger datasets which is cost and effort intensive. Recent works have shown that training MCN models using automatically labeled examples extracted from medical knowledge bases partially alleviates this problem. We extend this idea by computationally creating a distant dataset from patient discussion forums. We extract informal medical phrases and medical concepts from these forums using a synthetically trained classifier and an off-the-shelf medical entity linker respectively. We use pretrained sentence encoding models to find the k-nearest phrases corresponding to each medical concept.

Excessive inflammation is a key mechanism underlying vascular remodeling via the modulation of vascular fibrosis, phenotype and function. Recent evidence suggests that not only augmented inflammation but unresolved inflammation might also contribute to different aspects of vascular diseases. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by a family of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that limit immune cell infiltration and initiate tissue repair mechanisms. SPMs (lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins) are generated from essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. Synthases and receptors for SPMs were initially described in immune cells, but they are also present in endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), where they regulate processes important for vascular physiology, such as EC activation and VSMC phenotype. Evidence from genetic models targeting SPM pathways and pharmacological supplementation with SPMs have demonstrated that these mediators may play a protective role against the development of vascular remodeling in atherosclerosis, aneurysms and restenosis. This review focuses on the latest advances in understanding the role of SPMs in vascular cells and their therapeutic effects in the vascular remodeling associated with different cardiovascular diseases.","output":"Specialized Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators: New Therapeutic Approaches for Vascular Remodeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every year more attention is paid to improving the competitiveness of territories. In the context of the changes in 2020, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, the leadership of most countries faced the need to strengthen the work to create a positive image of the territories not only in the minds of foreign consumers (investors and tourists), but also directly among the population of these regions. For the Russian reality, this approach is relatively new, which is due to the lack of scientific justification for the effectiveness of such a mechanism. To date, the practical implementation of branding tools has been applied to individual cities and regions. At the same time, the need to organize systematic work on positioning both the entire country and individual regions in order to expand sales markets and increase the competitiveness of domestic products has been repeatedly discussed at the state level.

To assess the association between the implementation of local guidelines and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Background Vitamin D deficiency is associated with various adverse health outcomes including osteoporosis, fractures and myalgia. Most recently, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesised as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include incarceration, ethnicity, diet and a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Vitamin D deficiency is known to be prevalent among individuals within forensic mental health institutions. Local Trust guidelines advise that vitamin D levels should be checked within one-month of hospital admission, followed by checks at three-monthly intervals. Recommendations for prescribing depend on patients vitamin D levels;deficient (<25nmol/L), insufficient (25 < 50nmol/L) or adequate (50-150nmol/L). We assessed concordance with these guidelines at Broadmoor Hospital, UK. Method Medical records, laboratory results and drug charts were assessed for a total of 75 patients across 15 wards. Data were collected using a standardised audit tool, including;date of admission, admission vitamin D level, most recent vitamin D level and the dose and frequency of vitamin D prescribed. Result 76.4% of patients had their vitamin D levels checked within one month of admission. 66.7% of patients had their vitamin D checked within the last 3 months. For patients with an admission vitamin D level recorded, 43.6% had deficient vitamin D levels, 43.6% had insufficient levels and 12.7% had adequate levels. For patients with a more recent serum vitamin D level, 14.5% had deficient levels, 38.7% had insufficient levels and 46.8% had adequate levels. For patients with a documented serum vitamin D level, 21.4% were prescribed the correct dose, 22.9% were under-dosed, 14.3% were over-dosed and 41.4% received no dose where guidelines suggested they should. Conclusion Comparison of admission and most recent vitamin D levels suggests a general improvement in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with the implementation of local guidelines. However, we identify significant areas for improvement. A substantial proportion of patients lacked admission or regular monitoring of vitamin D levels and a substantial proportion of patients were under-dosed or received no dose where guidelines suggested they should have. We propose that better concordance with guidelines may improve clinical outcomes further. This may prove especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, given a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of respiratory infection.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency in a high secure forensic psychiatry hospital: A clinical audit and service evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the implementation of the nationwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination campaign, emergency departments (EDs) have had an increasing number of patients reporting postvaccination cardiovascular adverse effects. We investigated the clinical features of patients who visited the ED for cardiovascular adverse reactions after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in two EDs. Patients with cardiovascular adverse reactions after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination who visited EDs between June 1, 2021, and October 15, 2021, were selected. The clinical data of these patients were collected by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: Among 683 patients, 426 (62.4%) were female. The number of patients in their 20s was the highest (38.9% of males, 28.2% of females) (P < 0.001). More patients visited the ED for adverse reactions following the first vaccine dose than following the second dose (67.6% vs. 32.2%). Chief complaints were chest pain/discomfort (74.4%), dyspnea (14.3%) and palpitation (11.3%). The final diagnosis was a nonspecific cause (63.1%), and 663 (97.1%) patients were discharged from the ED. The admission rate was higher in males than in females (3.9% vs. 1.9%). Myocarditis was diagnosed in four males, who showed mild clinical progression and were discharged within 5 hospital days.

METHODS: Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed. RESULTS: We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals.

We investigated the immediate effects (over a 10 day period) of a strict nationwide stay-at-home order imposed in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing our analysis on the feelings of loneliness, we obtained our measures within a social context characterised by strong and continuous public and governmental support for increasing social bonds and cooperation in order to face the common public threat. Leveraging data from the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative, a prospective population-based study cohort, the short UCLA Loneliness Scale was administered to 1604 participants 2 years and 1 year before the stay-at-home lockdown and repeated, on average, 10 days after the official confinement order issued by the Spanish government. Ratings of loneliness remained stable during the 2 years before lockdown; however, they decreased significantly during the early stages of home confinement. This effect was particularly significant for the item feeling excluded from others and was also observed among individuals who were confined alone. Overall, the results suggest that gestures and manifestations of appreciation by people for the labour and efforts of certain individuals, along with official campaigns designed to promote feelings of inclusion and belonging, may have beneficial effects on feelings of loneliness, a negative emotional state strongly regarded as a risk factor for impaired mental and general health status.

The measure captures risk, transaction cost, price, transaction flow, revenue, and demand information in the context of the decision-makers behavior the network. The network consists of manufacturers, retailers, and consumers. Manufacturers and retailers are multicriteria decisionmakers who decide about their production and transaction quantities as well as the level of social relationship they want to pursue in order to maximize net return and minimize risk. The model allows us to investigate the interplay of the heterogeneous decision-makers in the supply chain and to compute the resultant equilibrium pattern of product outputs, transactions, product prices, and levels of social relationship. The results show that high levels of relationship can lead to lower overall cost and therefore lower price and higher product transaction.

SAMHD1, the unique dNTP triphosphohydrolase described in humans, has been proposed to play a key role in hematological cancers, although its value in advanced solid tumors has not yet been explored. Moreover, it has been proposed that SAMHD1 might fulfill the requirements of a driver gene in tumor development or might promote a so-called mutator phenotype. Here, we show that low SAMHD1 expression tumors show better prognosis in breast, ovarian, and lung advanced cancer. Moreover, low SAMHD1 expression is a positive predictive factor in lung and ovarian cancer treated with platin derivates and/or antimetabolites. In vitro evaluation of its underlying mechanism revealed that SAMHD1 KO cells presented enhanced susceptibility to DNA damage and subsequent induction of apoptosis of tumor cells. Our results provide strong evidence of the clinical importance of SAMHD1, becoming an interesting target for the development of personalized cancer treatments. ABSTRACT: SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase with important roles in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, either through the regulation of intracellular dNTPs levels or the modulation of the DNA damage response. However, SAMHD1s role in cancer evolution is still unknown. We performed the first in-depth study of SAMHD1s role in advanced solid tumors, by analyzing samples of 128 patients treated with chemotherapy agents based on platinum derivatives and/or antimetabolites, developing novel in vitro knock-out models to explore the mechanisms driving SAMHD1 function in cancer. Low (or no) expression of SAMHD1 was associated with a positive prognosis in breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cancer patients. A predictive value was associated with low-SAMHD1 expression in NSCLC and ovarian patients treated with antimetabolites in combination with platinum derivatives. In vitro, SAMHD1 knock-out cells showed increased -H2AX and apoptosis, suggesting that SAMHD1 depletion induces DNA damage leading to cell death. In vitro treatment with platinum-derived drugs significantly enhanced -H2AX and apoptotic markers expression in knock-out cells, indicating a synergic effect of SAMHD1 depletion and platinum-based treatment. SAMHD1 expression represents a new strong prognostic and predictive biomarker in solid tumors and, thus, modulation of the SAMHD1 function may constitute a promising target for the improvement of cancer therapy.","output":"Modulation of DNA Damage Response by SAM and HD Domain Containing Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Triphosphohydrolase (SAMHD1) Determines Prognosis and Treatment Efficacy in Different Solid Tumor Types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Children are a vulnerable population in terms of the impact of COVID-19 on their psychological well-being. When restricted to their homes, children are susceptible to problematic Internet gaming (PG). Primary school boys are particularly at risk of PG, which may lead to negative psychological effects, such as distress. Emerging research has identified perceived weight stigma (PWS) as a variable closely associated with both PG and psychological distress, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the trajectory of psychological distress among this vulnerable population from a longitudinal perspective, evaluating the role of PG and PWS. Methods: Self-report measures were used to assess psychological distress, PG, and PWS among primary school boys (grades 4 to grade 6? N = 283). Data were collected across three waves: before the pandemic, during school closure, and following the lifting of restrictions. Results: The trajectory of psychological distress among primary school boys was concave, indicating their mental health was negatively impacted during home restriction but recovered after the lockdown ended (linear change = 0.98, p < 0.01? quadratic change = -0.19, p < 0.01). PG was a significant covariate in terms of the trajectory of psychological distress (b = 0.02, p < 0.01). Moreover, baseline values for PWS were shown to have a negative direct effect on mental health before the pandemic (b = 0.05, p < 0.01), and moderated the time factor for boys' psychological distress over time (b of PWS  linear change = 0.04, p = 0.006? b of PWS  Quadratic change was negative at -0.01, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Although mental health gradually improved as home restrictions subsided, future studies are required to address changes in mental health upon return to school for students reporting higher levels of weight stigma.","output":"The trajectory of psychological distress and problematic Internet gaming among primary school boys: a longitudinal study across different periods of COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDis) are a major constraint to the health and production of small ruminants in Pakistan.

Recent studies have also shown that vaccines demonstrate reduced protection against symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we integrate published data on in vitro neutralisation and clinical protection to understand and predict vaccine efficacy against existing SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that neutralising activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is highly predictive of neutralisation of the VOC, with all vaccines showing a similar drop in neutralisation to the variants. Neutralisation levels remain strongly correlated with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 VOC (r=0.81, p=0.0005). We apply an existing model relating in vitro neutralisation to protection (parameterised on data from ancestral virus infection) and find this remains predictive of vaccine efficacy against VOC once drops in neutralisation to the VOC are taken into account. Modelling of predicted vaccine efficacy against variants over time suggests that protection against symptomatic infection may drop below 50% within the first year after vaccination for some current vaccines. Boosting of previously infected individuals with existing vaccines (which target ancestral virus) has been shown to significantly increase neutralising antibodies. Our modelling suggests that booster vaccination should enable high levels of immunity that prevent severe infection outcomes with the current SARS-CoV-2 VOC, at least in the medium term.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants: levels of neutralisation required for protective immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The volatile and fluid nature of ongoing changes makes it more difficult than ever for higher education institutions to stay in compliance with the immigration laws impacting international students, faculty, and staff That's according to immigration law expert Christian G A Zeller, Esq , Managing Partner at Maney Gordon Zeller, P A , who shared his expertise in a webinar hosted by Stetson University's Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy The COVID\\\\19 pandemic disrupted immigration and visa processes, while recent travel bans, entry requirements, and the presidential election continue to complicate this area of law and federal policy","output":"Discover impact of immigration laws, policies during pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by avian IB virus (IBV), is an acute and highly contagious disease of chickens.

We document the effectiveness of this new approach by way of comparison of technologies for automating RNA purification from wastewater samples. We compared processes using the Perkin-Elmer Chemagic(TM) 360 to a PEG/NaCl/Qiagen protocol that is used for detection of N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 markers by the majority of 19 pandemic wastewater testing labs in the State of Michigan. Specifically, we found that the Chemagic(TM) 360 lowered handling time, decreased the amount of wastewater required by 10-fold, increased the amount of RNA isolated per microliter of final elution product by approximately five-fold, and had no deleterious effect on subsequent ddPCR analysis. Moreover, for detection of markers on the borderline of detectability, we found that use of the Chemagi(TM) 360 enabled the detection of viral markers in a significant number of samples for which the result with the PEG/NaCl/Qiagen method was below the level of detectability. This improvement in detectability of the viral markers might be particularly important for early warning to public health authorities at the beginning of an outbreak.","output":"Automated method to extract and purify RNA from wastewater enables more sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 markers in community sewersheds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic affected Sri Lanka similar to how it affected other countries across the globe.

Using freely available data from the Epidemiological Department of Sri Lanka, a cluster analysis was carried out based on the COVID-19 data and the demographic data of districts. K-Means clustering and spectral clustering models were the selected clustering techniques in this study.

To gain insight into this relationship, we used the rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eight older and eight younger macaques were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Animals were evaluated using viral RNA quantification, clinical observations, thoracic radiographs, single-cell transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, cytokine detection, and lipidomics analysis at predefined time points in various tissues. Differences in clinical signs, pulmonary infiltrates, and virus replication were limited. Transcriptional signatures of inflammation-associated genes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 3 dpi revealed efficient mounting of innate immune defenses in both cohorts. However, age-specific divergence of immune responses emerged during the post-acute phase. Older animals exhibited sustained local inflammatory innate responses, whereas local effector T-cell responses were induced earlier in the younger animals. Circulating lipid mediator and cytokine levels highlighted increased repair-associated signals in the younger animals, and persistent pro-inflammatory responses in the older animals. In summary, despite similar disease outcomes, multi-omics profiling suggests that age may delay or impair antiviral cellular immune responses and delay efficient return to immune homeostasis.","output":"Age-related differences in immune dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The city of Freiburg has been among the most affected regions by the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) care, all parts of the rescue system were exposed to profound infrastructural changes. We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of these changes in the resuscitation landscape in the Freiburg region. METHODS: Utstein-style quantitative data on OHCA with CPR initiated, occurring in the first pandemic wave between February 27th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020 were compared to the same time periods between 2016 and 2019. Additionally, qualitative changes in the entire rescue system were analyzed and described. RESULTS: Incidence of OHCA with attempted CPR did not significantly increase during the pandemic period (11.1/100.000 inhabitants/63 days vs 10.4/100.000 inhabitants/63 days, p = 1.000). In witnessed cases, bystander-CPR decreased significantly from 57.7% (30/52) to 25% (4/16) (p = 0.043). A severe pre-existing condition (PEC) was documented more often, 66.7% (16/24) vs 38.2% (39/102) there were longer emergency medical services (EMS) response times, more resuscitation attempts terminated on scene, 62.5% (15/24) vs. 34.3% (35/102) and less patients transported to hospital (p = 0.019). Public basic life support courses, an app-based first-responder alarm system, Kids Save Lives activities and a prehospital extracorporeal CPR (eCPR) service were paused during the peak of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: In our region, bystander CPR in witnessed OHCA cases as well as the number of patients transported to hospital significantly decreased during the first pandemic wave. Several important parts of the resuscitation landscape were paused. The COVID-19 pandemic impedes OHCA care, which leads to additional casualties. Countermeasures should be taken.

It is generally recommended that a mother should breastfeed exclusively for at least 6 months. Sometimes, however, this is not possible owing to a maternal disease. The purpose of this review was to understand the possibility and the mechanisms of transmission of viral agents to breastfed infants when the mother is infected and to evaluate whether and when breastfeeding can be harmful and, therefore, a real contraindication exists. In order to produce this narrative review, an extensive literature search was conducted on PubMed. The query included \\"breastfeeding\\", \\"mother to child\\" and \\"transmission\\" as keywords and a filter for publication date - from 2014 to 2019. Additionally, the bibliography of the selected articles was reviewed to identify further pertinent studies, which were then included. Only the following maternal infections were found to represent an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding: Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, because of their possible transmission via milk, and Ebola Virus, in which transmission to the child seems to be linked more to the close proximity relationship itself than the presence of the virus in human milk. Other viruses - Herpes Simplex Virus, Varicella Zoster Virus and Hepatitis C Virus - constituted a source of contraindication only in specific high-risk circumstances. To date, for the remaining viruses reviewed in this paper - including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, no evidence exists that warrants contraindication of breastfeeding.

A question of increasing relevance is the extent to which the pursuit of climate action (SDG 13) interacts both positively and negatively with other SDGs. We tackle this question through a two-pronged approach: a novel, automated keyword search to identify linkages between SDGs and UK climate-relevant policies; and a detailed expert survey to evaluate these linkages through specific examples. We consider a particular subset of SDGs relating to health, economic growth, affordable and clean energy and sustainable cities and communities. Overall, we find that of the 89 UK climate-relevant policies assessed, most are particularly interlinked with the delivery of SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and that certain UK policies, like the Industrial Strategy and 25-Year Environment Plan, interlink with a wide range of SDGs. Focusing on these climate-relevant policies is therefore likely to deliver a wide range of synergies across SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 7, 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 11, 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). The expert survey demonstrates that in addition to the range of mostly synergistic interlinkages identified in the keyword search, there are also important potential trade-offs to consider.

Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) typically cannot grow at ethanol concentration much above 17% (v/v). Mitigation of these properties has the potential to increase yield. Previously, we have explored the effects of chaotropes on model enzyme systems and attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to offset these effects by kosmotropes (compounds which increase the order of the system, i.e. the \\"opposite\\" of chaotropes).

A parameter tweaking and an artificial neural network-based parameter learning model have been developed for effective forecasting of the dynamic risk.

In addition, comparisons between cats with ICGN and non immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN) were performed. Renal samples examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were performed. Signalment, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage were retrieved and used for comparisons. RESULTS: Sixty-eight client-owned cats were included. Thirty-seven cats (54.4%) had ICGN and 31 (45.6%) non-ICGN. Eighteen (48.6%) with ICGN had membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN), 14 (37.8%) membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and 5 (13.5%) mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MeGN). Clinico-pathological data were not associated with any type of ICGN. Among cats with non-ICGN, 11 (35.5%) had end-stage CKD, 9 (29%) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 6 (19.4%) global and multifocal mesangiosclerosis, 2 (6.5%) glomerular atrophy, 2 (6.5%) renal dysplasia and 1 (3.1%) amyloidosis. Eight (25.8%) cats with non-ICGN had chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) grade 1, 13 (41.9%) grade 2 and 10 (32.3%) grade 3; creatinine and UPC ratio increased with CIN grades (p = 0.001, p < 0.001). Cats with ICGN were more frequently FIV or FeLV-infected (OR:11.4; 95%CI:1.4C94.4; p = 0.024), had higher UPC ratio (OR:6.8; 95%CI:2.5C18.2; p < 0.001) and were younger (OR:0.9; 95%CI:0.7C1.0; p = 0.042) than cats with non-ICGN.

To date, there is no approved vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19, while the infection is spreading at an alarming rate globally. Because the development of effective vaccines or novel drugs could take several months (if not years), repurposing existing drugs is considered a more efficient strategy that could save lives now. Statins constitute a class of lipid-lowering drugs with proven safety profiles and many known beneficial pleiotropic effects. Our previous investigations showed that statins have antiviral effects and are involved in the process of wound healing in the lung. This triggered us to evaluate if statin use reduces mortality in COVID-19 patients. Results: After initial recruitment of 459 patients with COVID-19 (Shiraz province, Iran) and careful consideration of the exclusion criteria, a total of 150 patients, of which 75 received statins, were included in our retrospective study. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between statin use and rate of death. After propensity score matching, we found that statin use appeared to be associated with a lower risk of morbidity [HR=0.85, 95% CI=(0.02, 3.93), P =0.762] and lower risk of death [(HR= 0.76;95% CI=(0.16, 3.72), P =0.735)];however, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, statin use reduced the chance of being subjected to mechanical ventilation [OR=0.96, 95% CI=(0.61C2.99), P =0.942] and patients on statins had a more normal computed tomography (CT) scan result [OR=0.41, 95% CI= (0.07C2.33), P =0.312]. Conclusions: Although we could not demonstrate a significant association between statin use and a reduction in mortality in patients with COVID19 , we do feel that our results are promising and of clinical relevance and warrant the need for prospective randomized controlled trials and extensive retrospective studies to validate the potential beneficial effects of statin treatment on clinical symptoms and mortality rates associated with COVID-19.","output":"Statins in Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study in Iranian COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which manifests with a range of severities from mild illness to life threatening pneumonia and multi-organ failure.

Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the UK highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. DESIGN: Detailed survey information on social encounters from over 5800 respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. RESULTS: Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission we predict that under effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will generate any subsequent untraced infections, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36 individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact is unlikely to control spread. CONCLUSIONS: The current contact tracing strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation of contacts.

Breastmilk antibodies were less inflammatory than maternal serum antibodies, pointing to a sieve offunctional antibodies to breastmilk. These data highlight the preferential breastmilk transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgM to neonates, accompanied by selected subpopulations of IgG, positioned to create a non-pathologic, but highly protective barrier against COVID-19 disease.Funding Statement: This work was supported by by NHLBI (grants K08HL1469630-02 and K08HL146963-02S1, to KJG), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. (#1745302, to KMP), the NIH (U19 AI142790, U19 AI135995, R37AI080289), the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR).

Here, we assess lung autopsy findings in COVID-19 inpatients and untreated, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive individuals who died in the community to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we investigate if COVID-19 represents a unique histologic variant of DAD by comparing the pathologic findings to uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included 4 COVID-19 inpatients, 4 cases with post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses who died in the community, and 8 SARS-CoV-2-negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organization, and \\"acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia\\"-like intraalveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, hemorrhage, and capillaritis were not features of COVID-19-related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histologic manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients who die both in the hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxemic mechanical ventilation to the histologic changes. There are no distinctive morphologic features to confidently differentiate COVID-19-related DAD from DAD due to other causes.","output":"Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) from Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection is Morphologically Indistinguishable from Other Causes of DAD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the engagement of students enrolled in the fifth year of pharmaceutical studies in the management of the health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify some determinants of this engagement during this period. METHODS: With the health crisis, new missions have been entrusted during hospital internships, whereas certain internship sites were removed in hospitals and as part of the health service organization. In addition, some students who were no longer in internship returned to the hospital setting for helping in critical activities. Student engagement was studied with a questionnaire and focus groups including six or seven students in each group. RESULTS: Forty-three students participated to the study. The answers to the questionnaire highlighted that they were engaged, that they usually did not wait for compensation, and that most of them were satisfied by their activity during the crisis. The thematic analysis demonstrated that despite a feeling of frustration, which was often associated with the interruption of rewarded activities, and despite a stress due to the particular context, student engagement was supported by a better consideration of the pharmacist's role as a professional in public health and by a better acknowledgement of this role by other health professionals. CONCLUSION: This level of engagement is particularly encouraging because it is the witness of the ability of pharmacists to mobilize for general interest, even in adverse context.","output":"[Engagement of students enrolled in fifth year of pharmacy studies in their academic or salaried pharmaceutical activities during the first period of lockout due to the COVID-19 pandemic (16th March-11th May 2020)]./ Engagement d'tudiants de cinquime anne de pharmacie dans leurs activits pharmaceutiques, acadmiques et salaries, au cours de la premire priode de confinement lie  la pandmie de COVID-19 (16 mars-11 mai 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic.","output":"Framing COVID-19: How we conceptualize and discuss the pandemic on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the Coronavirus diseases-19 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, Korea has also been exposed to the virus.

Its rationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation by harming the advertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its international counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against media outlets using Twitter to ask companies to remove ads from the targeted outlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative characterization of this activism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between May and September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and Google Trends, toxicity and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese language, and an annotated corpus of SGB's tweets. Our key findings were threefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely successful (with 83.85\\\\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively) and that user pressure was correlated to the speed of companies' responses. Second, there were no significant changes in the online attention and the user engagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six months that followed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement). Third, we observed that user interactions with companies changed only transiently, even if the companies did not respond to SGB's request. Overall, our results paint a nuanced portrait of internet activism. On the one hand, they suggest that SGB was successful in getting companies to boycott specific media outlets, which may have harmed their advertisement revenue stream. On the other hand, they also suggest that the activist movement did not impact the online attention these media outlets received nor the online image of companies that did not respond positively to their requests.","output":"Analyzing the\\"Sleeping Giants\\"Activism Model in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research in assessing the global and asymmetric flows of health workers in general, and international medical graduates in particular, is fraught with controversy.

In times of global public health crises like the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, the need for equitable distribution and adequate training of health workers globally becomes even more pressing.

We comment on health personnel migration and retention based on our own experience in this area of research. Drawing from our examination of medical migration dynamics from sub-Saharan Africa, we argue for greater consideration of health workforce retention in research and policy related to resource-limited settings. The right to health suggests the need to retain healthcare providers whose education was typically subsidized by the home nation. The right to migrate may conflict with the right to health. Hence, a deeper understanding is needed as to healthcare worker motives based on interactions of psychosocial processes, economic and material determinants, and quality of work environments.","output":"African Physician Migration to High-Income Nations: Diverse Motives to Emigrate (\\"We Are not Florence Nightingale\\") or Stay in Africa (\\"There Is No Place Like Home\\") Comment on \\"Doctor Retention: A Cross-sectional Study of How Ireland Has Been Losing the Battle\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep and awakening quality (SQ and AQ) during COVID-19 in a large and diversified population in order to identify significant associations and risks in terms of demography, health and health-related behaviors, sleep variables, mental health, and attitudes.

This led to concerns that these puppies may have missed out on key socialisation experiences during periods of lockdown which could impact their future welfare. This study examined early-life exposure to socialisation and habituation experiences, including social and non-social stimuli and attendance at puppy classes, along with the health and demographics of puppies purchased under 16 weeks of age in the UK between 23 MarchC31 December 2020 (Pandemic Puppies cohort; n = 4369). Owners of puppies purchased under 16 weeks of age during the same date range pre-pandemic in 2019 (2019 puppies cohort; n = 1148) were surveyed as a comparison group. Pandemic Puppies were significantly less likely to have attended puppy training classes or been exposed to visitors to their home before 16 weeks of age than 2019 puppies. Pandemic Puppies were also significantly less likely to have had a veterinary health check prior to purchase or to be Kennel Club registered. In contrast, Pandemic Puppies were more likely to be a Designer Crossbreed and to be sold with a passport. This suggests majors shifts in the socialisation and demographics of the puppies acquired during the 2020 phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and raises concerns for the future welfare of Pandemic Puppies. ABSTRACT: The UK recorded sharp rises in puppy purchasing during the 2020 phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many first-time dog owners purchasing puppies to improve their mental health during this challenging period. Government restrictions on movement and social interaction during the pandemic led to animal welfare concerns over puppies reduced time-sensitive exposures to key environmental and social stimuli during their critical developmental period. This study aimed to compare demographics, health and early-life experiences of puppies purchased and brought home < 16 weeks of age between 23 MarchC31 December 2020 (Pandemic Puppies), with dogs purchased and brought home < 16 weeks during the same date period in 2019 (2019 puppies). An online survey of UK-based puppy owners was conducted between 10 November and 31 December 2020 with valid responses representing 5517 puppies (Pandemic Puppies: n = 4369; 2019 puppies: n = 1148). Multivariable logistic regression modelling revealed that Pandemic Puppies were less likely to have attended puppy training classes (67.9% 2019 vs. 28.9% 2020; p < 0.001) or had visitors to their home (94.5% 2019 vs. 81.8% 2020; p < 0.001) aged < 16 weeks compared with 2019 puppies. Fewer Pandemic Puppies underwent veterinary checks prior to purchase than 2019 puppies (2019: 91.3% vs. 2020: 87.4%; p < 0.001), but more were sold with a passport (2019: 4.1% vs. 2020: 7.1%; p < 0.001). Pandemic Puppies were significantly more likely to be Designer Crossbreeds (2019: 18.8% vs. 2020: 26.1%; p < 0.001) and less likely to be Kennel Club registered than 2019 puppies (2019: 58.2% vs. 2020: 46.2%; p < 0.001).

CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with COVID-19 was admitted to the hospital with hypoxemia. He was then treated with remdesivir, tocilizumab, and dexamethasone and was placed in the prone position. When his condition stabilized, pain in the left shoulder appeared. There was no fever or elevation in inflammation markers, and he was administered analgesics. However, the pain worsened and redness of the left neck appeared. Plain computed tomography (CT) showed swelling of the left neck muscles. Because cellulitis was suspected, he was treated with antibiotics, but his symptoms did not improve. Three days after the plain CT, contrast-enhanced CT showed sternoclavicular arthritis, deep neck abscess, and mediastinal abscess. Therefore, an emergency incisional drainage was performed under general anesthesia. Wound cleaning and drainage were continued after surgery, and after drainage tubes were removed, the patient was discharged on postoperative day 17. CONCLUSIONS Cervical infections after COVID-19 treatment have been reported in a few cases. Particularly, deep neck abscesses require more attention since they could be fatal if not treated immediately.

However, there is no evidence of its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients who presented up to 3 days after onset of Covid-19 symptoms (dry cough, fever, and/or fatigue) were enrolled. After confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, TID, for 5 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, general laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and hospitalization rate. Adverse events were also assessed. From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1,575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analyzed. Median time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4-5) days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms.

(GSK3?) in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: In this study, cell models of overexpressed or silenced RNF6 were established by liposome transfection, and IM-12 was used as the inhibitor of GSK3?. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blots were used to detect the expression of RNF6, p-GSK3?, GSK3?, and ?-catenin, and MTT assays were used to quantify cell proliferation. The tumorigenicity of cells was observed by plate clonal formation assay; the invasiveness of cells was examined in Transwell Boyden chambers, and the migratory capacity of cells was tested by scratch wound assays. The rat CRC model was induced by AOM/DSS, in which we verified activity in the Wnt/?-catenin pathway by examining GSK3? phosphorylation. RESULTS: RNF6 was upregulated in CRC samples and cell lines. Silencing or overexpressing RNF6 in colorectal cancer cells inhibited or promoted, respectively, the proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration of CRC cells, as well as expression of p-GSK3?, GSK3? and ?-catenin. IM-12 reversed the Wnt/?-catenin-activated state change induced by RNF6 silencing and the inhibition of cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, invasion and migration. The same results were observed in vivo in the rat CRC model. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of RNF6 in CRC increased the GSK3? phosphorylation level, which led to activation of the Wnt/?-catenin pathway and promoted the invasion and migration of CRC cells, suggesting that RNF6 may be a novel target for the treatment of CRC.","output":"RNF6 promotes colorectal cancer invasion and migration via the Wnt/?-catenin pathway by inhibiting GSK3? activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Amazonas was one of the most heavily affected Brazilian states by the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite a large number of infected people, particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern (VOC) Gamma (lineage P.1), SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier, we generated 1,188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021, of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus (P.1+) variants, designated as Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6, harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal (NTD) domain (particularly {Delta}144 or {Delta}141-144) associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1/S2 junction (N679K or P681H) that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site, as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4 (S:N679K) and P.1.6 (S:P681H) expanded (Re > 1) from March to July 2021, the lineage P.1 declined (Re < 1) and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still, we found no overrepresentation of P.1+ variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients (71%) in comparison to unvaccinated individuals (93%). This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma/P.1 sub-lineages that are more transmissible, although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts, the risk of selecting new variants with higher infectivity are expected to increase.","output":"Spread of Gamma (P.1) sub-lineages carrying Spike mutations close to the furin cleavage site and deletions in the N-terminal domain drives ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite a substantial association between professional burnout and depression, the exact nature of the relationship is unclear. It is hypothesized that an underlying susceptibility for depression is associated with an enhanced risk for professional burnout. In the present study, the relationship was examined between indices of personal and familial history of depression and current symptoms of burnout. METHODS Respondents were 3385 employees of different work settings (61% female, age 18-65 years), who completed questionnaires regarding demographic variables, working hours, personal and familial history of depression, current depressive symptomatology, and current symptoms of professional burnout. RESULTS After controlling for background variables, the strongest predictor of all three burnout facets was current depressive symptomatology. Independent of the effects of background variables and current depressive symptoms, having ever experienced a depressive episode further predicted current symptoms of two burnout facets: emotional exhaustion (OR=1.82, 95% CI=1.38-2.40, P<0.001) and cynicism (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16-1.98, P=0.002). In addition, a history of depression in close family members independently predicted current symptoms of emotional exhaustion (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.27-2.10, P<0.001), while a trend appeared for a similar effect on cynicism (OR=1.23, 95% CI=0.96-1.58, P=0.095).

In response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it has been shown that the generation of antigen-specific CD4(+) T-cell immunity is impaired in old mice. In contrast, recent findings document that old mice display a transient enhanced resistance that occurs within the first 3 weeks of infection. Early resistance was associated with the presence of CD8(+) T cells and their ability to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) well before their young counterparts.

In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18,354 mutations in S protein were analyzed and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3,705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11,324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout have also disproportionately affected African Americans. The purpose of this study is to describe the financial and employment impacts of COVID-19 in a population of African American cancer survivors and to compare those impacts with those experienced after a cancer diagnosis. Methods: Results include survey data from 593 participants in the population-based Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort who completed the ROCS enrollment survey and a supplemental questionnaire related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their financial wellbeing and employment. Most participants (96%) were not diagnosed with COVID-19 by the time they completed the supplement and reflect the societal impact of the pandemic rather than a personal COVID-19 diagnosis. Analyses compare reports of financial hardship (using assets, borrowing money, experiencing debt, decreases in income) and employment impacts (changes to work schedules, duties, hours, employment status) due to cancer and due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A similar proportion of ROCS participants reported financial hardship (41% vs. 42%) and borrowing money (5% vs. 6%) related to the COVID pandemic and their cancer diagnosis, respectively. Fewer survivors reported borrowing money (9% vs. 17%;p&lt;0.001) or experiencing a decrease in income due to COVID than cancer (20% vs. 28%;p = 0.001);however;more reported debt associated with COVID (30% vs. 17%;p&lt;0.001).

This study aimed to provide data on in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a single large center in Cameroon. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective follow-up was conducted from March 18 to June 30, 2020, including patients >18 years with positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab admitted to the Laquintinie Douala hospital COVID unit. Predictors of in-hospital mortality were assessed using Kaplan Meir survival curves and Weibull regression for the accelerated time failure model. Statistical significance was considered as p < 0.05. RESULTS: Overall 712 patients (65,7% men) were included, mean age 52,80  14,09 years. There were 580 (67,8% men) in-hospital patients. The median duration of hospital stay was eight days. The in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. Deceased patients compared to survivors were significantly older, had a higher temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate, and lowest peripheral oxygen saturation at admission. After adjusting for age, sex, and other clinical patient characteristics, increased heart rate, increased temperature, decreased peripheral oxygen saturation. The critical clinical status was significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. In contrast, hospitalization duration greater than eight days and the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZM) therapy was associated with decreased risk of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: One in five hospitalized COVID-19 patients die in a low-middle income setting. Critical clinical status, dyspnea, and increased heart rate were predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","output":"Kinin B1 Receptor Is Important in the Pathogenesis of Myeloperoxidase-Specific ANCA GN."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 global pandemic, originated from Wuhan, resulted in a massive increase in the output of polypropylene (PP)-based personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers.

Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Results: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary.

With two open windows, ACH was greater when a front and rear window were open than when two rear windows were open. With both front and rear ventilation fans set to exhaust, ACH was more than double that when both were set to supply. With air conditioning (AC) off, CO(2) and particles spread proportionally at the same rate from a source, whereas with the AC on, the spread rate of particles was about half that of CO(2), because particles might be trapped by a prefilter on the AC unit. Infection risk can be reduced by equipping AC unit with an appropriate filter.

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Luxembourgish population: the CON-VINCE study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Governments have imposed lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals have restricted outpatient clinics and elective services meant for non-COVID illnesses. This has led to patients facing unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. This study was carried out to assess patients concerns and apprehensions about the effect of the lockdown on their treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ambispective, observational cross-sectional single centre study was conducted. Patients were contacted telephonically and requested to answer a structured questionnaire. Their responses were documented and summarized as frequency and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 727 patients were interviewed. Epilepsy (32%) was the most common neurological illness in our cohort followed by stroke (18%). About half the patients and/or their caregivers reported health-related concerns during the lockdown. The primary concern was how to connect with their treating neurologist if need arose. Forty-seven patients (6.4%) had drug default. Among patients on immunomodulatory treatments, only eight patients had drug default. High compliance rates were also observed in the stroke and epilepsy cohorts. Of the 71 patients who required emergency care during the lockdown, 24 could reach our hospital emergency. Fourteen patients either had a delay or could not seek emergency care. Two-thirds of our patients found the telemedicine experience satisfactory. CONCLUSION: The ongoing pandemic will continue to pose challenges to both physicians and patients. Patients in follow-up may need to be contacted regularly and counselled regarding the importance of maintaining drug compliance.

Forced air warmer is effective to maintain body temperature. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) is harmful to human body and mainly produced by electronic equipment including convective air warming system. We investigated ELF-EMF from convective air warming device on various temperature selection and distance for guideline to protect medical personnel and patients. METHODS The intensity of ELF-EMF was measured as two-second interval for five minutes on various distance (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1meter) and temperature selection (high, medium, low and ambient). All of electrical devices were off including lamp, computer and air conditioner. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Mean values of ELF-EMF on the distance of 30 cm were 18.63, 18.44, 18.23 and 17.92 milligauss (mG) respectively (high, medium, low and ambient temperature set). ELF-EMF of high temperature set was higher than data of medium, low and ambient set in all the distances.

Many hypotheses regarding this association have been declared through the past decades, and it is agreed upon by most researchers that the multiple stressors that calves experience during transportation result in an overall immunosuppression that allows the respiratory tract to be invaded by numerous opportunistic pathogens. Furthermore, the innate immune cells, neutrophils, may be trapped in a paradox whereby their crucial defence and pathogen-killing activities are counteracted by excessive inflammation and tissue damage that may exacerbate disease, including the BRDC. Neutrophilia in response to glucocorticoids has been attributed to an influx of immature neutrophils newly released from the bone marrow, a decrease in neutrophil margination along endothelial walls, and a decrease in neutrophil apoptosis. Several of these explanations have been confirmed by altered expression of genes and proteins important for neutrophil margination and apoptosis.","output":"Invited review: Relationship between cattle transport, immunity and respiratory disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Few studies present clinical management approaches and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).

DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective, and observational cohort study (March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All subacute and long-term care residents at an urban SNF between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 (Chicago, IL). INTERVENTION: A multicomponent management pathway was developed to manage a large COVID-19 outbreak in an SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Chart review was used to extract demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, lab results, and clinical outcomes over 12 weeks, which were summarized and compared between residents with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: A multicomponent clinical management pathway was used to care for residents with COVID-19, which included frequent scheduled clinical and laboratory evaluation, use of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, antibiotics when indicated, and goals-of-care discussions. Of the 204 residents, 172 (84.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month period, with 50.5% symptomatic, 9.3% presymptomatic, and 24.5% asymptomatic, with a 30-day mortality rate of 15.7%.

Despite successes with existing vaccines and therapies that primarily target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, the susceptibility of RBD to mutations provides escape routes for the SARS-CoV-2 from neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, structural conservation in the spike protein can be targeted to reduce escape mutations and achieve broad protection. Here, we designed candidate stable immunogens that mimic surface features of selected conserved regions of spike protein through epitope grafting, in which we present the target epitope topology on diverse heterologous scaffolds that can structurally accommodate the spike epitopes. Structural characterization of the epitope-scaffolds showed stark agreement with our computational models and target epitopes. The sera from mice immunized with engineered designs display epitope-scaffolds and spike binding activity. We also demonstrated the utility of the designed epitope-scaffolds in diagnostic applications. Taken all together, our study provides important methodology for targeting the conserved, non-RBD structural motifs of spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 epitope vaccine design and demonstrates the potential utility of epitope grafting in rational vaccine design.","output":"Adaptation-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on all types of acute cardiac admissions (ACAs) and cardiac mortality in Malta.

Non-parametric correlation analyses between daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in Malta, Italy and the UK and daily ACAs were performed. Differences in cardiac death distribution (community vs. in-hospital) during the two periods were analysed. Results: There was a significant decline in daily ACAs in 2020 (median 3 [IQR 3]) vs. 2019 (median 5 [IQR 4]), p < 0.001. Patient characteristics were comparable. Delay to presentation for 2020 ACAs was significantly higher across all categories (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] median: 2019 [1 h, IQR 1] vs. 2020 [4 h, IQR 43.8], p = 0.009; non-ST-elevation-acute coronary syndrome [NSTE-ACS] median: 2019 [4 h, IQR 71] vs. 2020 [48 h, IQR 199], p = 0.001; non-ACS median: 2019 [24 h, IQR 95] vs. 2020 [84 h, IQR 499.8], p < 0.001).

Xuebijing (XBJ) injection is widely used in the treatment of severe pneumonia and sepsis in China due to its anti-inflammatory effect and immunoregulation. This study investigated whether Xuebijing injection can prevent the cytokine storm and reduce the mortality from severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blinded trial in which 60 eligible patients were recruited from the First people's Hospital of Jingzhou from February 16 to March 25 in 2020. A total of 57 completing the trial, 3 dropped out. Treatment group received routine medication plus Xuebijing while control group received routine plus saline. RESULTS: The secretion of interleukin-6(IL-6), interleukin-8(IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) was suppressed significantly (P<0.05) by Xuebijing. After 14 days treatment, lymphocyte levels in Xuebijing group was substantially higher than control, C-reactive protein (CRP) level in Xuebijing group was remarkably lower. The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the two group. After 14 days of treatment, there were significant differences in the rate of mechanical ventilation, rate of septic shock, the proportion of patients severely affected who became critically ill type, the duration of improvement of main clinical symptoms (P<0.05) and the length of ICU hospitalization stay (P<0.01) the Xuebijing group.No serious adverse reactions were found for all patients.

Accordingly, the prevalence of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) among refugees is high. Culture-specific symptoms of PGD have been described previously, but beliefs about causes and cures of PGD among refugees remain unknown. We therefore aimed at identifying illness beliefs and treatment expectations regarding PGD among refugees. METHOD: We focused on refugees from Arab countries (n = 14) and from Sub-Sahara Africa (n = 9) and applied qualitative and quantitative methods. In a semi-structured interview, participants first answered questions about assumed causes and potential cures for prototypical PGD symptoms according to ICD-11 that were presented in a vignette as representatives of their own culture. In the quantitative part, they completed the Cause Subscale of the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) that included additional culture-specific items. Interviews were analyzed with Qualitative Content Analysis. RESULTS: In both groups of refugees, PGD symptoms were predominantly attributed to a close relationship to the deceased, lack of social support, personal vulnerabilities, and circumstances of the death. Participants also named a number of flight-related causes (e.g., inability to perform or participate in rituals, feeling isolated in the host country). None of the participants attributed PGD symptoms to supernatural causes. Descriptive analyses of responses on the IPQ-R indicated that participants predominantly attributed PGD symptoms to psychological causes. Participants believed that PGD can be cured and predominantly mentioned social and religious support. Psychological help was only mentioned by a minority of participants. In both groups, participants emphasized that a therapist must be familiar with the patient's culture and rituals. Participants also mentioned stigma associated with seeking psychological help. CONCLUSION: Results suggest specific beliefs of refugees regarding causes and cures of PGD as well as similarities with Western conceptualizations. A culture-sensitive approach to the treatment of PGD in refugees that can include knowledge of culture-specific rituals and incorporating religious beliefs as well as decreasing stigma and increasing mental health literacy seem important. The study is limited by its focus on only two groups of refugees and its small sample size.","output":"Beliefs About Causes and Cures of Prolonged Grief Disorder Among Arab and Sub-Saharan African Refugees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is increasing worldwide, with over three quarters of cases now diagnosed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with resource-constraints. Loco-regional recurrence remains the predominant pattern of failure mandating adequate local therapy for acceptable loco-regional control and survival. There is high-quality evidence that intensification of treatment by either by adding concurrent chemotherapy or by altering radiotherapy (RT) fractionation improves outcomes in the curative-intent management of loco-regionally advanced HNSCC. Even conservative estimates indicate that >50% of patients in LMIC are unlikely to get access to timely RT, which will only get compounded with the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. The radiation oncology community has been systematically testing altered fractionation schedules in several solid cancers (breast, lung, and head-neck), given the cost-effectiveness, convenience, and compliance to short-course RT regimens. Radiobiological modelling suggests that standard fractionation of 6C7 weeks in HNSCC can be compressed safely into a 4-week schedule to counter accelerated repopulation by increasing the dose per fraction and delivering 5 fractions per week which is currently being tested in the ongoing multicentric trial of hypo- vs normo-fractionated accelerated RT (HYPNO study). Herein, we discuss the radiobiological basis of curative-intent hypofractionated-accelerated RT schedule delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks in HNSCC followed by critical appraisal of the published literature on such regimens with concurrent systemic therapy and its inherent resource-sparing potential applicable across large parts of the world particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Resource-sparing curative-intent hypofractionated-accelerated radiotherapy in head and neck cancer: More relevant than ever before in the COVID era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This correspondence argues that the conclusion given in the article \\"Conservative management of COVID-19-associated hypoxaemia\\" is not supported by the data https://bit.ly/3qAn7la.","output":"Conservative management of COVID-19 associated hypoxaemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic appears to have catastrophic clinical, fiscal, and social consequences, as well as a significant impact on health-care delivery.Dental hospitals and clinics have been functioning with limited access across most of the world since late March 2020 due to the contamination risks associated with aerosol-generated operations maxi-mizing the risk of exposure to dental professionals.

We present a unifying framework for blending mechanistic and machine-learning approaches to identify dynamical systems from noisily and partially observed data. We compare pure data-driven learning with hybrid models which incorporate imperfect domain knowledge. Our formulation is agnostic to the chosen machine learning model, is presented in both continuous- and discrete-time settings, and is compatible both with model errors that exhibit substantial memory and errors that are memoryless. First, we study memoryless linear (w.r.t. parametric-dependence) model error from a learning theory perspective, defining excess risk and generalization error. For ergodic continuous-time systems, we prove that both excess risk and generalization error are bounded above by terms that diminish with the square-root of T, the time-interval over which training data is specified. Secondly, we study scenarios that benefit from modeling with memory, proving universal approximation theorems for two classes of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs): both can learn memory-dependent model error. In addition, we connect one class of RNNs to reservoir computing, thereby relating learning of memory-dependent error to recent work on supervised learning between Banach spaces using random features. Numerical results are presented (Lorenz '63, Lorenz '96 Multiscale systems) to compare purely data-driven and hybrid approaches, finding hybrid methods less data-hungry and more parametrically efficient. Finally, we demonstrate numerically how data assimilation can be leveraged to learn hidden dynamics from noisy, partially-observed data, and illustrate challenges in representing memory by this approach, and in the training of such models.","output":"A Framework for Machine Learning of Model Error in Dynamical Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide there are currently over 1200 research studies being performed on the topic of COVID-19 Many of these involve children and adults over age 65 years There are also numerous studies testing investigational vaccines on healthy volunteers No research team is exempt from the pressures and speed at which COVID-19 research is occurring And this can increase the risk of honest error as well as misconduct To date, 33 papers have been identified as unsuitable for public use and either retracted, withdrawn, or noted with concern Asia is the source of most of these manuscripts (n=19;57 6%) with China the largest Asian subgroup (n=11;57 9%) This paper explores these findings and offers guidance for responsible research practice during pandemics","output":"The carnage of substandard research during the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This painting memorializes the lives of people who died in the COVID-19 pandemic and people who have died from police brutality.","output":"Breath Is Life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate central nervous system (CNS) lesions in non-effusive and effusive cases of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) regarding aspects related to astrocytic and microglial reactions. METHODS Five necropsied cats that were naturally infected with FIP virus, confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, with different intensities of CNS lesions, were studied. Brain and cerebellum were evaluated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin to assess astrocytic morphology, and lectin histochemistry for Ricinus communis agglutinin-I (RCA-I) to detect microglia was performed to evaluate the glial response in the CNS of cats with FIP. RESULTS An important astrocytic response in many areas of the CNS of all cats, including the periventricular areas of lateral ventricles and fourth ventricle, the molecular layer of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, was visualized. This astrocytic reactivity was associated with areas of granulomatous or pyogranulomatous vasculitis/perivasculitis in most cases, and it was characterized by multifocal to coalescing astrocytosis and astrogliosis with an increase in the expression of intermediate filaments, such as GFAP. However, astrocytes exhibited strong vimentin expression in neuroparenchyma with severe inflammatory and necrotic changes, but GFAP expression was mild or absent in these cases. A microglial response was present only in severe lesions, and RCA-I expression was detected primarily in gitter cells and resting microglia.

Among various self-report questionnaires of impulsivity, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is arguably the most frequently used measure. Despite its international use, inconsistencies in the suggested factor structure of its latest version, the BIS-11, have been observed repeatedly in different samples. The goal of the present study was therefore to test the factor structure of the BIS-11 in several samples. Methods Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on two representative samples of Hungarian adults (N = 2,457; N = 2,040) and a college sample (N = 765). Results Analyses did not confirm the original model of the measure in any of the samples. Based on explorative factor analyses, an alternative three-factor model (cognitive impulsivity; behavioral impulsivity; and impatience/restlessness) of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale is suggested. The pattern of the associations between the three factors and aggression, exercise, smoking, alcohol use, and psychological distress supports the construct validity of this new model. Discussion The new measurement model of impulsivity was confirmed in two independent samples.

Currently available prophylactic vaccines are type specific and have less therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, we aimed to predict the potential species-specific and therapeutic epitopes from the protein sequences of HPV45 by using different immunoinformatics tools. METHODS: Initially, we determined the antigenic potential of late (L1 and L2) and early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) proteins. Then, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) T-cell epitopes were selected based on their immunogenicity. In addition, epitope conservancy, population coverage (PC), and target receptor-binding affinity of the immunogenic epitopes were determined. Moreover, we predicted the possible CD8(+), nested interferon gamma (IFN-)-producing CD4(+), and linear B-cell epitopes. Further, antigenicity, allergenicity, immunogenicity, and system biology-based virtual pathway associated with cervical cancer were predicted to confirm the therapeutic efficiency of overlapped epitopes. RESULTS: Twenty-seven immunogenic epitopes were found to exhibit cross-protection (55%) against the 15 high-risk HPV strains (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 73, and 82). The highest PC was observed in Europe (96.30%), North America (93.98%), West Indies (90.34%), North Africa (90.14%), and East Asia (89.47%). Binding affinities of 79 docked complexes observed as global energy ranged from ?10.80 to ?86.71 kcal/mol. In addition, CD8(+) epitope-overlapped segments in CD4(+) and B-cell epitopes demonstrated that immunogenicity and IFN--producing efficiency ranged from 0.0483 to 0.5941 and 0.046 to 18, respectively. Further, time core simulation revealed the overlapped epitopes involved in pRb, p53, COX-2, NF-X1, and HPV45 infection signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Even though the results of this study need to be confirmed by further experimental peptide sensitization studies, the findings on immunogenic and IFN--producing CD8(+) and overlapped epitopes provide new insights into HPV vaccine development.","output":"Designing of CD8(+) and CD8(+)-overlapped CD4(+) epitope vaccine by targeting late and early proteins of human papillomavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zearalenone (ZEN), a nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin, has a negative effect on porcine intestine.

Additionally, the ability of Gln and Ala-Gln to protect the intestinal barrier was investigated. Our results showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, paracellular permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were increased by ZEN, while the glutathione (GSH) level was decreased by ZEN. Gln and Ala-Gln promoted the proliferation of cells and attenuated the ZEN-induced increase in cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and paracellular permeability.

This study compares safety and imaging response of ablation, chemoembolization, radioembolization, and supportive care in patients with both TIPS and HCC. METHODS This retrospective study included 48 patients who had both a TIPS and a diagnosis of HCC. Twenty-nine of 48 (60%) underwent treatment for HCC, and 19/48 (40%) received best supportive care (i.e., symptomatic management only). While etiology of cirrhosis and indication for TIPS were similar between the two groups, treated patients had better baseline liver function (34 vs. 67% Child-Pugh class C). Tumor characteristics were similar between the two groups. A total of 39 ablations, 17 chemoembolizations, and 10 yttrium-90 radioembolizations were performed on 29 patients. RESULTS Ablation procedures resulted in low rates of hepatotoxicity and clinical toxicity. Post-embolization/ablation syndrome occurred more frequently in patients undergoing chemoembolization than ablation (47 vs. 15%). Significant hepatic dysfunction occurred more frequently in the chemoembolization group than the ablation group. Follow-up imaging response showed objective response in 100% of ablation procedures, 67% of radioembolization procedures, and 50% of chemoembolization procedures (p = 0.001). When censored for OLT, patients undergoing treatment survived longer than patients receiving supportive care (2273 v. 439 days, p = 0.001).

Lockdown-specific barriers to disclosure of DVA reduced the opportunity for DVA detection and referral. The PRECODE (PRimary care rEsponse to domestic violence and abuse in the COvid-19 panDEmic) study will comprise quantitative analysis of the impact of the pandemic on referrals from IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety) trained general practices to DVA agencies in the UK and qualitative analysis of the experiences of clinicians responding to patients affected by DVA and adaptations they have made transitioning to remote DVA training and patient support. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a rapid mixed method design, PRECODE will explore and explain the dynamics of DVA referrals and support before and during the pandemic on a national scale using qualitative data and over four years of referrals time series data. We will undertake interrupted-time series and non-linear regression analysis, including sensitivity analyses, on time series of referrals to DVA services from routinely collected data to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on referrals to the IRIS Programme, and analyse key determinants associated with changes in referrals. We will also conduct an interview- and observation-based qualitative study to understand the variation, relevance and feasibility of primary care responses to DVA before and during the pandemic and its aftermath. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings using rapid analysis and synthesis will enable the articulation of multiscale trends in primary care responses to DVA and complex mechanisms by which these responses have changed during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Our findings will inform the implementation of remote primary care and DVA service responses as services re-configure. Understanding the adaptation of clinical and service responses to DVA during the pandemic is crucial for the development of evidence-based, effective remote support and referral beyond the pandemic.

However, current methodologies using IL-4+IL-7 result in suboptimal specificity, especially in CD8+ cells. Using a microexpansion platform, we screened various cytokine cocktails (IL-4+IL-7, IL-15, IL-15+IL-4, IL-15+IL-6, and IL-15+IL-7) for the most favorable culture conditions. IL-15+IL-7 optimally balanced T cell expansion, polyfunctionality, and CD8+ T cell skewing of a final therapeutic T cell product. Additionally, the transcriptomes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells cultured with IL-15+IL-7 displayed the strongest induction of antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response genes. Subsequently, microexpansion results were successfully translated to a GMP-applicable format where IL-15+IL-7 outperformed IL-4+IL-7 in specificity and expansion, especially in the desirable CD8+ T cell compartment.

There are few studies, however, on the demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, or outcomes of COVID-19 in people with HIV. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a large cohort of PLWH with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically identified all PLWH who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a large hospital from 3 March to 26 April 2020 during an outbreak in Massachusetts. We analyzed each of the cases to extract information including demographics, medical comorbidities, clinical presentation, and illness course after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: We describe a cohort of 36 PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 and another 11 patients with probable COVID-19. Almost 85% of PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. Approximately 77% of PLWH with COVID-19 were non-Hispanic Black or Latinx whereas only 40% of the PLWH in our clinic were Black or Latinx. Nearly half of PLWH with COVID-19 had exposure to congregate settings. In addition to people with confirmed COVID-19, we identified another 11 individuals with probable COVID-19, almost all of whom had negative PCR testing. CONCLUSION: In the largest cohort to date of PLWH and confirmed COVID-19, almost all had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, highlighting the importance of non-HIV risk factors in this population.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is not always limited to the respiratory tract, and renal infection and dysfunction have been shown to be specific risk factors for death. There is growing evidence that corona viruses may also invade the genitourinary system, causing urological symptoms. In this review, we discuss the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on the urogenital system and the possibility of urinary tract transmission. In addition, several studies have revealed that COVID-19 has a higher incidence, severity and mortality in men than women. This disparity is due to biological rather than comorbid or behavioral sex differences.

RESULTS: Two of these furoxan derivatives, (14b) and (14c), demonstrated a high selectivity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The compounds (14b) and (14c) were also active against a latent M. tuberculosis strain, with MIC90 values of 6.67 M and 9.84 M, respectively; they were also active against monoresistant strains (MIC90 values ranging from 0.61 to 20.42 M) and clinical MDR strains (MIC90 values ranging from 3.09 to 42.95 M). Time-kill experiments with compound (14c) showed early bactericidal effects that were superior to those of the first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs currently used in therapy. The safety of compounds (14b) and (14c) was demonstrated by the Ames test because these molecules were not mutagenic under the tested conditions. Finally, we confirmed the safety, and high efficacy of compounds (14b) and (14c), which reduced M. tuberculosis to undetectable levels in a mouse aerosol model of infection.

We evaluated the impact of this practice on transthoracic impedance (TTI) with varying force and in individuals with differing body mass indices (BMI). We additionally assessed whether specific prompts could improve physicians' ECV technique. METHODS The study comprised three parts: (1) TTI was measured in 11 participants throughout the respiratory cycle and with variable force applied to self-adhesive electrodes in anteroposterior (AP) and anterolateral (AL) configurations. (2) Three participants in different BMI classes then had TTI measured with prespecified incremental force applied. (3) Ten blinded cardiology trainees simulated ECV on one participant with and without prompting (guideline reminders and force analogies) while force applied and TTI were measured. RESULTS The AP approach was associated with 13% lower TTI than AL (P < 0.001). Strongly negative correlations were observed between force applied and TTI in the AL position, irrespective of BMI (P  0.003). In all cases, 80% of the total reduction in TTI observed was achieved with 8 kg-force (80 N). All prompts resulted in significantly greater force applied and modest reductions in TTI.

Medical and psychological emergency units mission is the medical and psychological emergency care of people impacted during a traumatic event. Given their expertise in crisis management, they set up an important medical and psychological support system adapted to the health crisis characteristics. The unusual modalities of intervention, the specific clinic that these professionals faced in this context of great tension may have unsettled workers and generate a psychological impact. This study aims to assess the existence of such repercussions among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals involved in this new system. METHOD: In all, 313 medical and psychological emergency unit professionals agreed to participate at the online survey. They filled surveys and visual analog scales assessing the difficulties encountered in the system, as well as their level of satisfaction, post-traumatic stress, burnout, level of anxiety and depression and coping strategies put in place. RESULTS: Results show few significant emotional difficulties. However higher scores are found among women, among professionals who felt a negative impact on their personal lives, as well as for those who thought they had been infected with COVID-19. The establishment of coping strategies such as active coping, planning, expressing feelings, positive reinterpretation and acceptance helped to decrease the level of emotional complexities and brought more compassionate satisfaction. We note that participants with more medical and psychological emergency unit experience tend to show less emotional hardship and more compassionate satisfaction. It appears that older as well as younger professionals have lower burnout scores, as do workers who conducted more interviews for the same person. Likewise, participants who were satisfied of the system organization and of the support C a majority in this study C report less emotional challenges and more compassionate satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Psychological impact in this new system among medical and psychological emergency unit professionals is overall low. It appears that some coping strategies, perceived usefulness, satisfaction with the organization and the received support are associated with a lower level of emotional difficulties. A supportive framework and an operative organization of the medical and psychological emergency unit system in times of crisis has a protective effect on the participants.","output":"Impact psychologique de limplication des professionnels des CUMP dans le dispositif de soins mdico-psychologique face  lpidmie COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A Sndrome Respiratria Aguda Grave (SRAG) deve ser notificada e investigada.

The reverse transcription process takes place between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the host cell, thus the Reverse Transcription Complexes (RTCs)/Pre-integration Complexes (PICs) are hosted in intact or partial cores. Early biochemical assays failed to identify the viral CA associated to the RTC/PIC, possibly due to the stringent detergent conditions used to fractionate the cells or to isolate the viral complexes. More recently, it has been observed that some host partners of capsid, such as Nup153 and CPSF6, can only bind multimeric CA proteins organized in hexamers. Those host factors are mainly located in the nuclear compartment, suggesting the entrance of the viral CA as multimeric structure inside the nucleus. Recent data show CA complexes within the nucleus having a different morphology from the cytoplasmic ones, clearly highlighting the remodeling of the viral cores during nuclear translocation. Thus, the multimeric CA complexes lead the viral genome into the host nuclear compartment, piloting the intranuclear journey of HIV-1 in order to successfully replicate.

At most institutions, these procedures are performed and monitored after the induction of general anesthesia. OBJECTIVE To report our success with elective intracranial stenting and angioplasty performed in conscious patients after the administration of mild sedatives and local anesthetic agents. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated data from 66 patients who underwent elective intracranial stenting for atherosclerosis. Sixty-one procedures were performed under local anesthesia with mild sedation; 3 were performed under general anesthesia, and 2 were converted from local to general anesthesia during the procedure. Intraprocedural neurological changes were monitored and led to reevaluation of technique, immediate reimaging, modifying the endovascular procedure itself, or possibly mandating conversion to general anesthesia. RESULTS Thirty-nine anterior and 27 posterior circulation stenotic segments were treated. Angiographic success was achieved in 95.5% of patients with an overall reduction in stenosis of 75.5 to 22.3%. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting were used in 58 cases; 8 patients were treated with stenting alone. Three patients (4.9%) developed neurological deficits mandating alteration or adjustment of endovascular technique or immediate postoperative management to avoid permanent sequelae. A total of 8 periprocedural complications occurred, 2 of which resulted in permanent neurological deficit. The overall mortality rate was 3.2%.

Simulations are helpful for examining the potential consequences of control options under different scenarios. Particularly, results from models with constant parameters and models with time-dependent parameter functions are compared, demonstrating the significant differences in model outcomes. Results suggest that the effectiveness of vaccination and drug treatment can be very sensitive to factors including the time of introduction of the pathogen into the population, the beginning time of control programs, and the levels of control measures.

A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.","output":"Role of red blood cell distribution width, as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused unprecedented global health and economic crises.

Meanwhile, several nMAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein are in different stages of development and clinical testing. Preclinical studies have shown that cocktails of potent nMAbs targeting the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV-2, as well as broad-nMAbs targeting conserved regions within the virus spike, might be effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Currently, several clinical trials have started to test safety, tolerability, PKs and efficacy of these nMAbs. One paramount limitation for the use of nMAbs in clinical settings is the production of large amounts of MAbs and the high costs related to it.

The competition of approaches is expressed in the confrontation between supporters of energy based on renewable sources and supporters of traditional energy resources. A comparative analysis of changes in the energy sector, depending on the prevalence of a particular approach to energy development, shows that external conditions play a key role in promoting the energy strategy. The strategy of priority development of \\"green\\" energy carried out under Barack Obama could not be realized because of the shale boom. As a result, many companies working with renewable energy sources did not stand up to the competition. The opposite approach of Donald Trump's focus on developing traditional energy resources to ensure US energy security and to increase jobs has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has virtually nullified the US administration's efforts under this approach. The current concept of President J. Biden is aimed at continuing the strategy of Barack Obama for the development of \\"green\\" energy in the United States. Proponents of this concept hope for the possibility of its at least partial implementation in the absence of a shale boom. The lifting of the embargo on the export of American oil has led to an increase in oil supplies abroad. As of 2018, the United States has overtaken Saudi Arabia in terms of oil and gas exports, taking a leading position in the global oil market. In 2019-2020, the United States retained the first place in the world in oil production. This article examines the conceptual approaches of American administrations to the issue of energy policy and analyzes the statistical data that characterize the traditional and \\"clean energy\\" industries. An important factor is the degree of influence of the US energy policy on global oil prices. To analyze this issue, this research uses curved regression equations to assess the impact of US energy policy on world oil prices under the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The results of the correlation show that a more effective interaction between the variables was carried out during the presidency of Barack Obama, when Exports of Crude Oil influenced the price dynamics of oil quotes with an inverse relationship. With the arrival of the Biden administration, the strategy started under Obama in favor of developing clean energy was continued. In the context of the spread of covid-19, the growth of crisis phenomena in the national economy, the growth of production costs in the oil and gas industry, and the fall in the world energy prices, the development of green energy can have a certain effect, given the Biden administration's approach to energy development. The subsequent actions of the Biden administration may offset Trump's efforts to develop traditional energy to strengthen the economic potential of the United States and strengthen the position of American companies in the global oil market.

This is even more alarming as obesity increases the COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity is more complex than a simple association with BMI. In particular, obesity has been associated with low death rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a fatal comorbidity to COVID-19, possibly due to the obesity paradox. Also, visceral adiposity could be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity, due to its immune activation component, release of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and involvement in the cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and embolism. A poor antioxidant nutritional status also weakens the immune system, increasing inflammation and infection risk. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown might impact lifestyle patterns, mental health and weight bias, worsening the obesity then COIVD-19 situation. On the other hand, health care expenses and productivity loss are expected to increase during the concomitant epidemics. The co-occurrence of obesity and COVID-19 is a major challenge at both public health and economic levels that should urgently be taken into consideration. The identification of COVID-19 weight related risk factors and the development of appropriate weight management programs are needed to tackle the concomitant epidemics.","output":"Obesity considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: El mundo vive una situacin excepcional por el avance de la pandemia producida por el coronavirus 2 del sndrome respiratorio agudo grave y la indita medida de aislamiento social preventivo y obligatorio utilizada por varios pases Esta situacin genera un impacto psicosocial que ha sido insuficientemente abordado Objetivo: Analizar la repercusin que sobre la salud mental pudiera provocar la COVID-19 y las medidas para su prevencin y control, as como las estrategias para favorecerla Material y Mtodos: Se realiz una revisin bibliogrfica en el perodo comprendido entre marzo y abril de 2020 Se consultaron fuentes de informacin disponibles en la Biblioteca Virtual de Salud de la red telemtica infomed, entre ellas, las bases de datos SciELO, Pubmed/Medline, Cumed, Lilacs Se us adems el buscador Google acadmico Se utilizaron los buscadores propios de las diferentes fuentes y se dise?

We organised the study during the first waves of Covid-19. To conceptualise how deregulated bodies have been structured into the industry as the exchange condition of work, we draw on the work of transnational feminist and Marxist scholars. The study provides insights about how a gendered GPN emerged under the neoliberal development regime;the pattern of work and work conditions are innately linked to volatile market conditions. By documenting workers lived experiences, the paper enhances our empirical understanding of how workers depend upon work, and how a form of expendable but regulated life linked with work has been embedded in GPN. Our findings reveal that unlike those of other human beings, workers bodies do not need to be regulated by norms that enable protection from Covid-19. As for the workers, work implies earning for living and survival, so live or be left to die becomes the fundamental employment condition, and the possibility of their death an overlooked consideration. This reality has not changed or been challenged, despite the existence of compliance regimes. We further argue that as scholars, we bear a responsibility to consider how we engage in research on the implications of such organisation practices in a global environment, when all of us are experiencing the pandemic.","output":"Live or be left to die?

Given the extensive impact of COVID-19 globally, there is international interest to learn from best practices that have been shown to work in controlling community spread to inform future outbreaks. This study explores the trajectory of COVID-19 infection in Singapore had the government intervention not focused on containment, but rather on mitigation. In addition, we estimate the actual COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore, given that confirmed cases are publicly available. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a COVID-19 infection model, which is a modified SIR model that differentiate between detected (diagnosed) and undetected (undiagnosed) individuals and segments total population into seven health states: susceptible (S), infected asymptomatic undiagnosed (A), infected asymptomatic diagnosed (I), infected symptomatic undiagnosed (U), infected symptomatic diagnosed (E), recovered (R), and dead (D). To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent (b) infectious and (c) non-infectious; while the symptomatic infected were disaggregated into two stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The simulation result shows that by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, under the containment intervention implemented in Singapore, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370C54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; while the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097C90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34C39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%. Importantly, our simulation model results suggest that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could be uncovered via a serological study. Compared to the containment intervention, a mitigation intervention would have resulted in early peak infection, and increase both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths. CONCLUSION: Early public health measures in the context of targeted, aggressive containment including swift and effective contact tracing and quarantine, was likely responsible for suppressing the number of COVID-19 infections in Singapore.","output":"The effectiveness of public health interventions against COVID-19: Lessons from the Singapore experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tract and might therefore be a source of infection for the surgical team during abdominal operations. One of the most common surgical procedures performed is appendectomy. However, reports of virologic testing of appendiceal tissue specimens in COVID-19 patients are lacking. We sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the appendectomy specimen of a patient with COVID-19. Case presentation: A female patient presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care academic hospital with lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. She was admitted to the gynecological floor because of suspected pelvic inflammatory disease. Due to worsening symptoms, a laparoscopy was performed the next day and a severely inflamed appendix was detected. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed without complications. A few hours postoperatively, the patient was tested positive for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene was performed on the appendectomy specimen. SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected. During her hospital stay, the patient developed mild respiratory symptoms while the postoperative course was otherwise uncomplicated. Conclusions: : The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the appendectomy specimen of our case adds to the preliminary available evidence indicating that appendectomy in COVID-19 patients with mild disease carries probably a low risk of infection by aerosols generated during the procedure.","output":"No SARS-CoV-2 detected in the vermiform appendix of a COVID-19 patient with appendicitis: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes severe lung disease and substantial mortality How the virus evades host defense for efficient replication is not fully understood In this report, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) impaired stress granule (SG) formation induced by viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 NP associated with the protein kinase PKR after dsRNA stimulation SARS-CoV-2 NP did not affect dsRNA-induced PKR oligomerization, but impaired dsRNA-induced PKR phosphorylation (a hallmark of its activation) as well as SG formation SARS-CoV-2 NP also targeted the SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 and impaired G3BP1-mediated SG formation Deficiency of PKR or G3BP1 impaired dsRNA-triggered SG formation and increased SARS-CoV-2 replication The NP of SARS-CoV also targeted both PKR and G3BP1 to impair dsRNA-induced SG formation, whereas the NP of MERS-CoV targeted PKR, but not G3BP1 for the impairment Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 NP promotes viral replication by impairing formation of antiviral SGs, and reveal a conserved mechanism on evasion of host antiviral responses by highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein impairs stress granule formation to promote viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) may positively or negatively impact outcomes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective cohort study of Veterans with treated hypertension in the Veterans Health Administration (01/19/2020-08/28/2020), we compared users of (A) ARB/ACEI vs. non-ARB/ACEI (excluding Veterans with compelling indications to reduce confounding by indication) and (B) ARB vs. ACEI among (1) SARS-CoV-2+ outpatients and (2) COVID-19 hospitalized inpatients. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization or mortality (outpatients) and all-cause mortality (inpatients). We estimated hazard ratios (HR) using propensity score-weighted Cox regression. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between exposure groups after weighting. Among outpatients, there were 5.0 and 6.0 primary outcomes per 100 person-months for ARB/ACEI (n = 2,482) vs. non-ARB/ACEI (n = 2,487) users (HR 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.99, median follow-up 87 days).

To answer these questions, we conducted a survey over several weeks, that involved employees coming from different industries (N=170), in order to collect their experience, skills and motivations for teleworking. The results show that adoption of telework is real for the respondents. Those who have experienced it present a strong motivation and a real capacity to use it, with almost no technological barriers.

METHODS: A Twitter chat was organized on three consecutive days, after final examinations, inviting all pharmacy students in KSA to participate. Day 1 chat included 11 questions regarding learning and assessment, Day 2 chat included six questions about online examinations and six questions about technology use, Day 3 chat included six questions related to lessons learnt from the learning experiences during the lockdown. The questions were validated and piloted before the chat. The responses were copied, reviewed to remove any confidential information, and thematically analyzed by two teams of research students independently. RESULTS: During the three-day chat, 790 responses were received in total. Thematic analysis generated 944 codes which were categorized into 43 subthemes. These subthemes were further categorized into six main themes: facilitators for online education, barriers for online education, online versus onsite education, role of technology in online education, suggestions for improving online education and long-term impact of online education during lockdown. Participants highlighted several facilitators and barriers which affected their education during the lockdown, compared online education with onsite education, and provided suggestions for improving online education based on their learning experiences during the lockdown.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Placental epigenetic mechanisms may be involved, but no prior epigenome-wide studies have investigated the impact of maternal POPs on placental DNA methylation. We studied the association between maternal plasma POP concentration in early pregnancy and epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation among 260 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. RESULTS: Our analysis focused on POPs with more than 80% plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification, including 3 organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 1 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 47), 3 polychlorinated biphenyls (138/158, 153, 180), and 6 poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)). Using 5% false discovery rate, POPs were associated with a total of 214 differentially methylated CpG sites (nominal p values ranging from 2.61  10(?21) to 2.11  10(?7)). Out of the 214 CpG sites, 24 (11%) were significantly correlated with placental expression of 21 genes. Notably, higher PFUnDA was associated with increased methylation at 3 CpG sites (cg13996963, cg12089439, cg18145877) annotated to TUSC3, and increased methylation at those 3 CpG sites was correlated with decreased expression of TUSC3 in the placenta. Increased methylation at cg18145877 (TUSC3) and decreased expression of TUSC3 were correlated with shorter birth length. Out of the 214 CpG sites, methylation at 44 CpG sites was correlated (p value < 0.10) with at least one neonatal anthropometry measure (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). Seven CpG sites mediated (p value < 0.05) the association between PBDE 47 and neonatal anthropometry measures. Genes annotating the top differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in pathways related to differentiation of embryonic cells (PBDE 47) and in pathways related to brain size and brain morphology (PFASs). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation changes in the placenta were significantly associated with maternal plasma POPs concentration.

They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05). Supplementation of BC or BCV in the diet resulted in a decreased abdominal fat pad (P < 0.05). In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.","output":"Effects of bamboo charcoal powder, bamboo vinegar, and their combination in laying hens on performance, egg quality, relative organ weights, and intestinal bacterial populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Cyclosporine may improve the clinical course and outcomes of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its antiviral and anti-cytokine effects as shown in vitro.

Using Taiwan as an example, this report was to describe the sources of potential medication shortages, discuss the preparedness and contingency strategies to address medication shortages, and outline the evidence-based recommendations on ensuring an stable medication supply and improving the quality and security of medicines. Summary Much of drug shortages have focused on shortfalls of overseas manufacturing, but the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on misallocation of medications within the nations internal supply chains is also a great concern. A wide range of stakeholders are involved in the pharmaceutical supply chains, including government regulators, healthcare insurers, pharmaceutical companies, frontline physicians and pharmacists, patients and families, professional and patient associations or unions, and even individuals who acquire medications from abroad. Collaborative inputs and efforts from all these interdependent stakeholders are critical for establishing transparent preparedness and contingency plans to address drug shortages affected by disruptions of overseas manufacturing or stock-outs in pharmacies due to medication misallocation. Strategies have been documented and recommended in Taiwan and the United States to mitigate drug shortages and ensure the long-term quality and security of medicines. Conclusion Barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new, but the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and even novel challenges to the stability and integrity of medication supply, which urges for a need to reconsider and reinforce effective management strategies for pharmaceuticals. Active management, transparent information, and timely communications are essential to ensure a stable supply of key therapeutic medications, especially during a pandemic.","output":"Managing medication supply chains: Lessons learned from Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic and preparedness planning for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Professional bus drivers risk developing musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and disability due to their working condition. The current study investigates the prevalence rate of MSP and disability among professional bus drivers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 83 professional bus drivers. The prevalence rate of MSP was evaluated using a standardized Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. The disabilities due to the MSP were evaluated using neck disability index (NDI), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) tools. Prevalence of MSP was presented with 95% of confidence interval (CI) at an alpha level of 0.05. The 12 months and 7 days prevalence of MSP were tabulated for analysing the trend of MSP between the upper and lower body regions. RESULTS: The drivers had a mean driving experience of 10.07  7.26 years. The mean driving hours/week were 50.25  12.82 h. Neck and back were the most affected regions with a prevalence rate of 81.9% (N = 68) and 80.7% (N = 67) at 12 months.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 9811 health workers operating at the Verona University Hospital, Italy, from 27 December 2020 to 3 May 2021. All health workers were offered vaccination with Comirnaty (BNT162b2, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, United States), and a health surveillance program was implemented with periodical swab testing. Vaccination status and clinical data were collected using an ad hoc semi-structured questionnaire and health surveillance charts. Results: As of 3rd of May, 82.5% of health workers had been vaccinated against SAR-CoV-2, and 177 (1.8%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination more than halved the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced by two-thirds the cumulative incidence of symptomatic subjects. In detail, most unvaccinated HWs were symptomatic; 50% reported fever, 45% reported ageusia/anosmia, and nearly 20% reported dyspnea. These percentages were much lower in HWs who had been vaccinated for at least 14 days (18% for fever and anosmia, 6% for dyspnea and ageusia). Moreover, cases of vaccine breakthrough were sixfold less likely to further spread the infection than unvaccinated HWs.

Thousands of people have lost their lives to this disease. Its negative effects on public health are ongoing. In this study, an intelligence computer-aided model that can automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases is proposed to support daily clinical applications. The proposed model is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically reveal discriminative features on chest X-ray images through its convolution with rich filter families, abstraction, and weight-sharing characteristics. Contrary to the generally used transfer learning approach, the proposed deep CNN model was trained from scratch. Instead of the pre-trained CNNs, a novel serial network consisting of five convolution layers was designed. This CNN model was utilized as a deep feature extractor. The extracted deep discriminative features were used to feed the machine learning algorithms, which were k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The experiments were conducted on a public COVID-19 radiology database. The database was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 70% and 30% rates, respectively. As a result, the most efficient results were ensured by the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 98.97%, a sensitivity of 89.39%, a specificity of 99.75%, and an F-score of 96.72%. Consequently, a cheap, fast, and reliable intelligence tool has been provided for COVID-19 infection detection. The developed model can be used to assist field specialists, physicians, and radiologists in the decision-making process.

Additional topics included affordable telehealth services, research from France on the relationship between nicotine and COVID-19, concerns about gambling addiction, and changing patterns in substance misuse as drug availability varies. Conclusions: Analyzing Twitter content enables health professionals to identify the public's concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from text mining studies addressing timely health topics can serve as preliminary analyses for building more comprehensive models, which can then be used to generate recommendations for the larger public and inform policy.","output":"Identifying #addiction concerns on twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic: A text mining analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is rife with potential pathogens. Of those that infect humans, it is estimated that roughly 20 % are of nonhuman primate origin. The same ease characterizes pathogen transmission in the other direction, from humans to nonhuman primates. This latter problem has increasingly serious ramifications for conservation efforts, as growing numbers of ecotourists and researchers serve as potential vectors of disease. Here, we present an analysis of major cross-species transmission events between human and nonhuman primates. In particular, we consider HIV and malaria as case studies in which nonhuman primate pathogens emerged and became permanent fixtures in human populations. The human practices that facilitate such events are considered, as well as the evolutionary consequences of these events. In addition, we describe human-to-nonhuman primate transmission events and discuss the potential of human pathogens to adapt to nonhuman primate hosts.

We explored a new mathematical approach based on game theory, the so-called multi-perturbation Shapley value analysis (MSA), to assess causal function localizations and interactions from multiple perturbation data. We applied MSA to a dataset composed of lesion patterns of 148 acute stroke patients and their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, to systematically investigate the influence of different parameter settings on the outcomes of the approach. Specifically, we investigated aspects of MSA methodology including the choice of the predictor algorithm (typology and kernel functions), training dataset (original versus binary), as well as the influence of lesion thresholds. We assessed the suitability of MSA for processing real clinical lesion data and established the central parameters for this analysis. RESULTS We derived general recommendations for the analysis of clinical datasets by MSA and showed that, for the studied dataset, the best approach was to use a linear-kernel support vector machine predictor, trained with a binary training dataset, where the binarization was implemented through a median threshold of lesion size for each region. We demonstrated that the results obtained with different MSA variants lead to almost identical results as the basic MSA. CONCLUSIONS MSA is a feasible approach for the multivariate lesion analysis of clinical stroke data.

Lipid-mediated nucleic acid delivery is an alternative to viral vector-mediated gene delivery and has the following advantages. Lipid-mediated delivery of DNA or mRNA is usually more rapid than viral-mediated delivery, offers a larger payload, and has a nearly zero risk of incorporation. Lipid-mediated delivery of DNA or RNA is therefore preferable to viral DNA delivery in those clinical applications that do not require long-term expression for chronic conditions. Delivery of RNA may be preferable to non-viral DNA delivery in some clinical applications, since transit across the nuclear membrane is not necessary, and onset of expression with RNA is therefore even faster than with DNA, although both are faster than most viral vectors. Delivery of RNA to target organ(s) has previously been challenging due to RNAs rapid degradation in biological systems, but cationic lipids complexed with RNA, as well as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), have allowed for delivery and expression of the complexed RNA both in vitro and in vivo. This review will focus on the non-viral lipid-mediated delivery of RNAs, including mRNA, siRNA, shRNA, and microRNA, to the central nervous system (CNS), an organ with at least two unique challenges. The CNS contains a large number of slowly dividing or non-dividing cell types and is protected by the blood brain barrier (BBB). In non-dividing cells, RNA-lipid complexes demonstrated increased transfection efficiency relative to DNA transfection. The efficiency, timing of the onset, and duration of expression after transfection may determine which nucleic acid is best for which proposed therapy. Expression can be seen as soon as 1 h after RNA delivery, but duration of expression has been limited to 5C7 h. In contrast, transfection with a DNA lipoplex demonstrates protein expression within 5 h and lasts as long as several weeks after transfection.","output":"Non-Viral Delivery of RNA Gene Therapy to the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increased level of technology usage in schools and the move to online learning, many schools had to re-evaluate the content of their cyber-safety policy and review it to ensure it works within and beyond the schools premises.

The objectives of this work were to characterise the kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) concentration in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the antibody response in patients with (D(+)) and without (D(-)) dexamethasone treatment. METHODS: Data and biosamples from hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, enrolled between March 4(th) and December 11(th), 2020, in a prospective observational study, were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration in serial URT samples was measured using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin A and G (IgA and IgG) were measured in serum samples using S1-ELISA. RESULTS: We compared 101 immunocompetent patients who received dexamethasone according to the inclusion criteria and dosage determined in the RECOVERY trial to 93 immunocompetent patients with comparable disease severity from the first months of the pandemic, who had not been treated with dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. We found no inter-group differences in virus concentration kinetics, duration of presence of viral loads >10(6) viral copies/mL (D(+): median 17 days (IQR 13-24), D(-): 19 days (IQR 13-29)), or time from symptom onset until seroconversion (IgA: D(+): median 11.5 days (IQR 11-12), D(-): 14 days (IQR 11.5-15.75); IgG: D(+): 13 days (IQR 12-14.5), D(-): 12 days (IQR 11-15)).

This limitation motivated us to propose a wrapper for feature subset selection (FSS) based on parallel and distributed hybrid evolutionary algorithms (EAs) under the Apache Spark environment. The hybrid EAs are based on the BDE and Binary Threshold Accepting (BTA), a point-based EA, which is invoked to enhance the search capability and avoid premature convergence of the PB-DE. Thus, we designed the hybrid variants (i) parallel binary differential evolution and threshold accepting (PB-DETA), where DE and TA work in tandem in every iteration, and (ii) parallel binary threshold accepting and differential evolution (PB-TADE), where TA and DE work in tandem in every iteration under the Apache Spark environment. Both PB-DETA and PB-TADE are compared with the baseline, viz., the parallel version of the binary differential evolution (PB-DE). All three proposed approaches use logistic regression (LR) to compute the fitness function, namely, the area under ROC curve (AUC). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is tested over the five large datasets of varying feature space dimension, taken from cyber security and biology domains.

Early prediction of emerging strains could be vital to pandemic preparedness but remains an open challenge. Here, we developed Strainflow, to learn the latent dimensions of 0.9 million high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and used machine learning algorithms to predict upcoming caseloads of SARS-CoV-2. In our Strainflow model, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were treated as documents, and codons as words to learn unsupervised codon embeddings (latent dimensions). We discovered that codon-level changes lead to a change in the entropy of the latent dimensions. We used a machine learning algorithm to find the most relevant latent dimensions called Dimensions of Concern (DoCs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike genes, and demonstrate their potential to provide a lead time for predicting new caseloads in several countries. The DoCs capture codons associated with global Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), and may be surveilled to predict country-specific emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Highlights We developed a genomic surveillance model for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, Strainflow, where sequences were treated as documents with words (codons) to learn the codon context of 0.9 million spike genes using the skip-gram algorithm. Time series analysis of the information content (Entropy) of the latent dimensions learned by Strainflow shows a leading relationship with the monthly COVID-19 cases for seven countries (e.g., USA, Japan, India, and others). Machine Learning modeling of the entropy of the latent dimensions helped us to develop an epidemiological early warning system for the COVID-19 caseloads. The top codons associated with the most relevant latent dimensions (DoCs) were linked to SARS-CoV-2 variants, and these DoCs may be used as a surrogate to track the country-specific spread of the variants.

We use data from an online survey of Israeli adult cannabis users (N = 440), conducted in May of 2020, to test associations between media use frequency for COVID-19 information and three problematic cannabis use behaviors: increased cannabis use, increased use alone, and increased use before midday. Among all respondents, 41% agreed that their cannabis use had increased since the onset of the pandemic. Analyses showed that higher frequency of media use was positively associated with all three indicators of problematic cannabis use, and that associations were partly mediated by maladaptive coping strategies. Higher frequency of media use for information about COVID-19 may be an indicator of difficulty with coping and of increased risk of escalation of cannabis use.

Approximately 60% of PCOS women have insulin resistance. While the efficacy of metformin in reducing insulin resistance and decreasing androgen level has been widely validated, there is no agreement on the dose of metformin to be used. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prospective non-randomized cohort study of 108 insulin resistant, overweight and obese PCOS women, aged between 22 and 35 years. All patients received 1500 mg of metformin (500 mg x 3 times/day) for the first 6 months. At the end of this period, the patients' HOMA index was evaluated. In subjects, who did not demonstrate normalization of the HOMA index, the dose was increased to 2500 mg/day (500 mg at breakfast and 1000 mg at lunch and dinner) for additional 6 months. The hormonal blood profile, fasting insulin and fasting glucose levels, HOMA index, anthropometric assessment, pelvic ultrasound, FAI index and cholesterol were evaluated. RESULTS Overall results showed a good response to metformin therapy in insulin-resistant PCOS patients with BMI >25, while in patients with higher BMI (31.15  0.40), no normalization of HOMA was found.

Thus, reducing negative effects that influenced many industrial sectors, especially healthcare.

Most artificial intelligence-based studies used the original computed tomography images to build their models; however, the integration of texture-based radiomics images and deep learning techniques could improve the diagnostic accuracy of the novel coronavirus diseases. This study proposes a computer-assisted diagnostic framework based on multiple deep learning and texture-based radiomics approaches. It first trains three Residual Networks (ResNets) deep learning techniques with two texture-based radiomics images including discrete wavelet transform and gray-level covariance matrix instead of the original computed tomography images. Then, it fuses the texture-based radiomics deep features sets extracted from each using discrete cosine transform. Thereafter, it further combines the fused texture-based radiomics deep features obtained from the three convolutional neural networks. Finally, three support vector machine classifiers are utilized for the classification procedure. The proposed method is validated experimentally on the benchmark severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 computed tomography image dataset. The accuracies attained indicate that using texture-based radiomics (gray-level covariance matrix, discrete wavelet transform) images for training the ResNet-18 (83.22%, 74.9%), ResNet-50 (80.94%, 78.39%), and ResNet-101 (80.54%, 77.99%) is better than using the original computed tomography images (70.34%, 76.51%, and 73.42%) for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F1-score achieved using the proposed computer-assisted diagnostic after the two fusion steps are 99.47%, 99.72%, 99.60%, 99.72%, and 99.60% which proves that combining texture-based radiomics deep features obtained from the three ResNets has boosted its performance. Thus, fusing multiple texture-based radiomics deep features mined from several convolutional neural networks is better than using only one type of radiomics approach and a single convolutional neural network.

We aimed to determine whether ventilation strategies using higher PEEP and/or RMs could decrease mortality in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL from 1996 to December 2019, included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation with higher PEEP and/or RMs to strategies with lower PEEP and no RMs in patients with ARDS. We computed pooled estimates with a DerSimonian-Laird mixed-effects model, assessing mortality and incidence of barotrauma, population characteristics, physiologic variables and ventilator settings. We performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA) and a meta-regression. RESULTS: Excluding two studies that used tidal volume (V(T)) reduction as co-intervention, we included 3870 patients from 10 trials using higher PEEP alone (n = 3), combined with RMs (n = 6) or RMs alone (n = 1).

Resources are scarce, and allocating them to disease mitigation instead of other uses necessarily involves the loss of alternative sources of benefit to people. For society to obtain the maximum benefits from using resources, the gains from disease mitigation must be compared to the resource costs, guiding decisions made with the objective of achieving the optimal net outcome. DISCUSSION: Economics provides criteria to guide decisions aimed at optimising the net benefits from the use of scarce resources. Assessing the benefits of disease mitigation is no exception. However, the technical complexity of mitigation means that economic evaluation is not straightforward because of the technical relationship of surveillance to intervention. We argue that analysis of the magnitudes and distribution of benefits and costs for any given strategy, and hence the outcome in net terms, requires that mitigation is considered in three conceptually distinct stages. In Stage I, 'sustainment', the mitigation objective is to sustain a free or acceptable status by preventing an increase of a pathogen or eliminating it when it occurs. The role of surveillance is to document that the pathogen remains below a defined threshold, giving early warning of an increase in incidence or other significant changes in risk, and enabling early response. If a pathogen is not contained, the situation needs to be assessed as Stage II, 'investigation'. Here, surveillance obtains critical epidemiological information to decide on the appropriate intervention strategy to reduce or eradicate a disease in Stage III, 'implementation'. Stage III surveillance informs the choice, timing, and scale of interventions and documents the progress of interventions directed at prevalence reduction in the population. SUMMARY: This article originates from a research project to develop a conceptual framework and practical tool for the economic evaluation of surveillance. Exploring the technical relationship between mitigation as a source of economic value and surveillance and intervention as sources of economic cost is crucial. A framework linking the key technical relationships is proposed. Three conceptually distinct stages of mitigation are identified.

Unexpectedly, the daily average ozone concentration profile was practically indistinguishable from that of the past two years for the same time span in the calendar. So, we compared surface meteorology data, CO, NOx and O3 hourly concentrations in the MCMA from the ozone season (from March 1 to May 31) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also, TROPOMI satellite data on column count of CO, NO2 and HCHO, above a sparse grid of surface points in the MCMA, were also compared for March, April, and May 2020 with those from 2019. Population density used as a background variable to increase understanding of the observed differences allowed us to propose that reductions in NOx were so drastic that ozone formation moved rapidly from a VOC sensitive region towards a NOx sensitive region. The relevance of that unplanned policy provides impacts of contingent short-term emissions control actions during very high pollution episodes. Further analysis of these and other related data concerning VOC speciation and emissions patterns during the coronavirus lockdown may provide guidelines to enhance emission control policies in the post-COVID-19 times to come.","output":"Ozone over Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In childhood and adolescence the motor performance is seen as important marker of health.

A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted using 28 diagnostic PCR assays and 793 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from animals. Sixteen out of the investigated 28 PCR assays displayed at least one mismatch with their targets at the 0.5% threshold. Mismatches were detected in seven, two, two, and six assays targeting the ORF1ab, spike, envelope, and nucleocapsid genes, respectively. Several of these mismatches, such as the deletions and mismatches at the 3 end of the primer or probe, are expected to negatively affect the diagnostic PCR assays resulting in false-negative results. The modifications to the oligo sequences should result in stronger template binding by the oligos, better sensitivity of the assays, and higher confidence in the result.

The current literature suggests that there are no specific histopathological characteristics in the placenta related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but placentas from infected women are more likely to show findings of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion. The most common findings in placentas from infected women were fibrin deposition and intense recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates.

It is therefore of great medicinal interest to modulate the cellular responses to TNF-.

In order to further understand the potential mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of ebosin at molecular level, we investigated the impact of it on the activation of MAPK and NF-B pathways following TNF- induced in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The results showed that the phosphorylation levels of TNF--induced p38, JNK1, JNK2, IKK, IKK, and IB, as well as NF-B nuclear translocation, were reduced significantly in FLS cells in response to ebosin. Furthermore, we proved that ebosin decreased the level of NF-B in the nucleus and blocked the DNA-binding ability of NF-B using electrophoresis mobility gel shift assay. Besides, low levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) and chemokines (interleukin-8 and RANTES) were found in TNF--stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes treated with ebosin.

METHODS This Western Australian, whole-jurisdictional linked-data, retrospective cohort study compared maternal and neonatal outcomes of first postcancer pregnancies among women CRC survivors against randomly selected pregnancies of women with no cancer history. Logistic regression models were used to investigate a range of adverse outcomes independently associated with CRC and its surgical and adjunctive treatments. RESULTS Among 627,762 deliveries during the study period (1983-2007), 232 were first pregnancies following CRC. Whether following laparoscopic or open cancer surgery, these pregnancies were independently associated with a significantly increased risk of antepartum hemorrhage [odds ratios (ORs): 1.25; 2.13 for the respective procedures], postpartum hemorrhage (ORs: 1.61; 3.31), Cesarean delivery (ORs: 2.42; 4.24), infant low Apgar score (ORs: 1.32; 2.64), need for neonatal resuscitation (ORs: 1.49; 3.20), and special care admission (ORs: 1.42; 2.87). A history of open (but not laparoscopic) cancer surgery was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal obstruction during pregnancy (OR 1.17) and prolonged postpartum hospitalization (OR 3.11). Neither was significantly associated with perinatal death. Among women with previous CRC, rectal (versus colonic) malignancy was independently associated with a significantly higher risk of overall maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes (ORs: 3.73 and 2.73, respectively), as was radiotherapy (ORs: 4.24 and 2.81, respectively). Chemotherapy was independently associated with a marginally but significantly higher risk of overall maternal but not neonatal outcomes (ORs: 1.11; 0.98). Open versus laparoscopic cancer surgery was associated with a significantly higher risk of antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage, low Apgar score, need for neonatal resuscitation, and neonatal special care admission.

The free triiodothyronine (FT3)/TSH ratio (FT3/TSH) was the second Cbest for distinguishing GD from AIT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of FT3/TSH was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.84C0.88, p<0.0001); its optimal cutoff was 1.99 pmol/mIU (79% sensitivity and 80% specificity). Its effectiveness was confirmed in cohort 2 (81% sensitivity and 100% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: The FT3/TSH ratio is a new useful index for differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, especially when combined with TRAb.","output":"Serum Ratio of Free Triiodothyronine to Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone: A Novel Index for Distinguishing Graves Disease From Autoimmune Thyroiditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 has affected not only physical health but also devastated mental wellbeing. The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown limiting movement of the entire 1.3 billion populations. The impact of the pandemic on depression, anxiety and self-care behaviour among the general population was investigated. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out with an anonymous questionnaire using validated instruments. Multivariable linear regression analysis was carried out to find the role of each variable in determining the relevant scores. Result: The mean age of the 1052 participants was 30.52 (SD  13.42) years. The mean score of depression and anxiety was 5.96 and 5.27 respectively. Moderate to severe depression was noted among 18.68% and moderate to severe anxiety was noted among 16.1% of the respondents. Gender was a significant predictor of all three (depression, anxiety, and coping) scores, while the civil status predicted both depression and anxiety scores and age predicted only the depression score. Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the surveyed population in our setting has manifested symptoms of anxiety and depression. Gender, civil status and age predicted various scores. ?

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is promising target for antiviral drugs, which plays a vital role for viral duplication. Development of the inhibitor against M(pro) is an ideal strategy to combat COVID-19. In this work, twenty-three hydroxamates 1a-i and thiosemicarbazones 2a-n were identified by FRET screening to be the potent inhibitors of M(pro), which exhibited more than 94% (except 1c) and more than 69% inhibition, and an IC(50) value in the range of 0.12C31.51 and 2.43C34.22 M, respectively. 1a and 2b were found to be the most effective inhibitors in the hydroxamates and thiosemicarbazones, with an IC(50) of 0.12 and 2.43 M, respectively. Enzyme kinetics, jump dilution and thermal shift assays revealed that 2b is a competitive inhibitor of M(pro), while 1a is a time-dependently inhibitor; 2b reversibly but 1a irreversibly bound to the target; the binding of 2b increased but 1a decreased stability of the target, and DTT assays indicate that 1a is the promiscuous cysteine protease inhibitor. Cytotoxicity assays showed that 1a has low, but 2b has certain cytotoxicity on the mouse fibroblast cells (L929). Docking studies revealed that the benzyloxycarbonyl carbon of 1a formed thioester with Cys145, while the phenolic hydroxyl oxygen of 2b formed H-bonds with Cys145 and Asn142.

The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI  30 kg/m(2)) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. METHODS: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36C3.00) and upper RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22C1.96). Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs.

It seems that vaccination, one of the most effective public-health interventions, presents a ray of hope to end the pandemic by achieving herd immunity. In this review, we aimed to cover aspects of the current knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and vaccine candidates in the light of autoimmune inflammatory diseases (AIIDs) and to analyze their potential in terms of safety and effectiveness in patients with AIIDs. Therefore, a focused narrative review was carried out to predict the possible implications of different types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which confer distinct immune mechanisms to establish immune response and protection against COVID-19: whole virus (inactivated or weakened), viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), nucleic acid (RNA, DNA), and protein-based (protein subunit, virus-like particle). Still, there is uncertainty among patients with AIIDs and clinicians about the effectiveness and safety of the new vaccines. There are a variety of approaches towards building a protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Only high-quality clinical trials would clarify the underlying immunological mechanisms of the newly implemented vaccines/adjuvants in patients living with AIIDs.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and autoimmune diseases amidst the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is the predominant virus currently detected in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs).

Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that direct COVID-19 death counts in the US in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 were considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering health equity in the policy response to the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and excess mortality in the United States: A county-level analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is a pandemic causing havoc globally Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat COVID-19 In the absence of effective treatment, off-label drug use, in lieu of evidence from published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is common in COVID-19 Although it is vital to treat affected patients with antiviral drugs, there is a knowledge gap regarding the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in these patients Recent Findings: Colchicine trials to combat inflammation in COVID-19 patients have not received much attention We await the results of ongoing colchicine randomized controlled trials in COVID-19, evaluating colchicines efficacy in treating COVID-19 Summary: This review gives a spotlight on colchicines anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties and why colchicine may help fight COVID-19 This review summarizes colchicines mechanism of action via the tubulin-colchicine complex Furthermore, it discussed how colchicine interferes with several inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization;disruption of superoxide production, inflammasome inhibition, and tumor necrosis factor reduction;and its possible antiviral properties In addition, colchicine dosing and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug interactions and how they relate to ongoing, colchicine in COVID-19 clinical trials, are examined","output":"Colchicine in COVID-19: an Old Drug, New Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly increasing number of confirmed cases and extremely large amounts of medical resources about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are enriching the COVID-19 domain knowledge bases.

For the last two decades, HASTY (HST), the ortholog of human Exportin-5, has been considered as a candidate protein that exports plant miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report HST functions in the miRNA pathway independent of its cargo-exporting activity in Arabidopsis. We found that Arabidopsis mutants with impaired HST shuttling present normal subcellular distribution of miRNAs. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction and microscopy assays showed that HST directly interacts with the microprocessor core component DCL1 through its N-terminal domain. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that HST also interacts, independently of its N-terminal domain, with the mediator complex subunit MED37. Further experiments showed that HST could act as a scaffold to facilitate the recruitment of DCL1 to genomic MIRNA loci by stabilizing the DCL1-MED37 complex, which in turn promotes the transcription and proper processing of pri-miRNAs. In summary, our results suggest that HST is likely associated with the formation of the miRNA biogenesis complex at MIRNA genes, promoting the transcription and processing of pri-miRNAs, rather than with the direct export of processed miRNAs from the nucleus.","output":"HASTY modulates miRNA biogenesis by linking pri-miRNA transcription and processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the perspectives of manager cognition and behavior selection, this paper analyzes the cognitive basis of manufacturer's green innovation and discovers that the embodied cognition of the manager has an important influence on the selection of green innovation behavior.

Remote measurement technologies (RMTs) offer the opportunity to track symptoms continuously and in real time; therefore, they may provide a more accurate picture of RA disease activity as a complement to prescheduled general practitioner appointments. Previous research has shown patient interest in remote symptom tracking in RA and has provided evidence for its clinical validity. However, there is a lack of co-design in the current development of systems, and the features of RMTs that best promote optimal engagement remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study represents the first in a series of work that aims to develop a multiparametric RMT system for symptom tracking in RA. The objective of this study is to determine the important outcomes for disease management in patients with RA and how these can be best captured via remote measurement. METHODS: A total of 9 patients (aged 23-77 years; mean 55.78, SD 17.54) with RA were recruited from Kings College Hospital to participate in two semistructured focus groups. Both focus group discussions were conducted by a facilitator and a lived-experience researcher. The sessions were recorded, transcribed, independently coded, and analyzed for themes. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified a total of four overarching themes: important symptoms and outcomes in RA, management of RA symptoms, views on the current health care system, and views on the use of RMTs in RA. Mobility and pain were key symptoms to consider for symptom tracking as well as symptom triggers. There is a general consensus that the ability to track fluctuations and transmit such data to clinicians would aid in individual symptom management and the effectiveness of clinical care. Suggestions for visually capturing symptom fluctuations in an app were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support previous work on the acceptability of RMT with RA disease management and address key outcomes for integration into a remote monitoring system for RA self-management and clinical care. Clear recommendations for RMT design are proposed. Future work will aim to take these recommendations into a user testing phase.","output":"Remote Measurement in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Qualitative Analysis of Patient Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant diseases caused by plant viruses and pathogens seriously affect crop yield and quality, and it is very difficult to control them.

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine computed tomography images of a human auricle were segmented to create an external anatomic envelope filled with orthogonally interconnected spherical pores. Scaffolds with and without tissue inset sites were 3D printed by laser sintering bioresorbable polycaprolactone, then implanted subcutaneously in five rats for each group. RESULTS Ten athymic rats were studied to a goal of 24 weeks postoperatively. Precise anatomic similarity and scaffold integrity were maintained in both scaffold conditions throughout experimentation with grossly visible tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis upon explantation. Cartilage-seeded scaffolds had relatively lower rates of nonsurgical site complications compared to unseeded scaffolds with relatively increased surgical site ulceration, though neither met statistical significance. Histology revealed robust soft tissue infiltration and vascularization in both seeded and unseeded scaffolds, and demonstrated impressive maintenance of viable cartilage in cartilage-seeded scaffolds. Radiology confirmed soft tissue infiltration in all scaffolds, and biomechanical modeling suggested amelioration of stress in scaffolds implanted with cartilage. CONCLUSIONS A hybrid approach incorporating cartilage insets into 3D-printed bioscaffolds suggests enhanced clinical and histological outcomes.

Here, we report the persistence of nAb responses over 12 months after infection despite their decreasing trend noticed from 6 months. METHODS: The study included sera from 497 individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 between January and August 2020. Samples were collected at 6 and 12 months after onset. The titers of IgG to the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) were measured by CLEIA.

RESULTS: Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases (~30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility to reinfection with the variants of concerns (VOCs). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 convalescent individuals have robust humoral immunity even at 12 months after infection albeit that the medical history and background of patients could affect the function and dynamics of antibody response to the VOCs.","output":"Persistence of robust humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent individuals over twelve months after infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of spiritual nourishment has become the hope of the people in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results showed that the Crohns diseases twin (twin 2) had no antibody detection and reduced activation of CD4+ T cell responses, unlike the twin without the autoimmune disease (twin 1). Twin 2 developed antigen-specific central memory CD8+ T-cells and IFN production after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination, similar to twin 1. These findings elucidated the role of T-cell immunity after COVID-19 immunization on IBD patients despite the lack of antibody production.

To reduce the current rate of ventilator-induced lung injury requires ventilator settings that are patient-, time-, and disease-specific. A common lung protective strategy is to optimise the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) through a recruitment manoeuvre to prevent alveolar collapse at the end of expiration and to improve gas exchange through recruitment of additional alveoli. However, this process can subject parts of the lung to excessively high pressures or volumes. This research significantly extends and more robustly validates a previously developed pulmonary mechanics model to predict lung mechanics throughout recruitment manoeuvres. In particular, the process of recruitment is more thoroughly investigated and the impact of the inclusion of expiratory data when estimating peak inspiratory pressure is assessed. Data from the McREM trial and CURE pilot trial were used to test model predictive capability and assumptions. For PEEP changes of up to and including 14 cmH2O, the parabolic model was shown to improve peak inspiratory pressure prediction resulting in less than 10% absolute error in the CURE cohort and 16% in the McREM cohort.

Viral RNA mutations can arise from misincorporation by RNA-polymerases and modification by host factors. Recent SARS-CoV-2 sequence analyses showed a strong bias toward C-to-U mutation, suggesting that host APOBEC cytosine deaminases with immune functions may cause the mutation. We report the experimental evidence demonstrating that APOBEC3A and APOBEC1 can efficiently edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA to produce C-to-U mutation at specific sites. However, APOBEC-editing does not inhibit the viral RNA accumulation in cells. Instead, APOBEC3A-editing of SARS-CoV-2 promotes viral replication/propagation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the APOBEC-mediated mutations for fitness and evolution. Unlike the unpredictability of random mutations, this study has significant implications in predicting the potential mutations based on the UC/AC motifs and surrounding RNA structures, thus offering a basis for guiding future antiviral therapies and vaccines against the escape mutants.

Concomitantly, the state of children's health in the least-developed countries is the worst since the 1950s before the Declaration of Alma Ata. Worldwide decline in public health protections, infrastructures, and systems, and a health worker crisis primarily in Africa and Asia, limit the delivery of intensive and critical care services. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subgroups by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS Using pandemics as a model of public health emergencies, steps to improve care to the most vulnerable of populations are outlined, including mandates under the International Health Regulations Treaty of 2007 and World Health Organization guidelines. Recommendations include an emphasis on first improving primary care, prevention, and basic emergency care, where possible. Advances in care should move incrementally without compromising primary care resources. A first step in preparing for a pandemic in developing countries involves building capacity in public health surveillance and proven community containment and mitigation strategies. Given the severe lack of healthcare workers in at least 57 countries, the Task Force also supports World Health Organization's recommendations that planning for a public health emergency include means for health workers to collaborate with staff in the military, transport, and education sectors as well as international healthcare workers to maximize the efficiency of scarce human resources. Rapid response teams can be augmented by international subject matter experts if these do not exist at the country level.","output":"The reality of pediatric emergency mass critical care in the developing world."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study investigated 18F-FDG PET/CT features of adenovirus-vectored vaccination against COVID-19 in healthy subjects.

Using cancer genomics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we performed computational analyses of associations between ACE2 expression and antitumor immunity, immunotherapy response, oncogenic pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical outcomes in 13 cancer cohorts. We found that ACE2 upregulation was associated with increased antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression, and favorable anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy response. ACE2 expression levels inversely correlated with the activity of cell cycle, mismatch repair, TGF-?, Wnt, VEGF, and Notch signaling pathways. Moreover, ACE2 expression levels had significant inverse correlations with tumor proliferation, stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

The primary purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of older adult caregivers in an online, interactive mindfulness intervention. METHODS. Self-reported older caregivers who participated in an online-based mindfulness program (n = 20) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about any previous experience with mindfulness and/or meditation, hopes or goals held prior to the start of the program, desired expectations, motivation for joining, impressions of sessions, most beneficial topics, potential application of content, and any perceived effects. Participants responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS.

METHODS: The researchers analyzed data and information derived from service statistics reports from June 1st to July 15th, 2020 in terms of hospital resources, as well as utilization patterns of beds, ICU, and ventilators, for 11 screening hospitals affiliated with the General Organization of Teaching Hospitals and institutes in Egypt assigned by the Ministry of Health and Population to provide medical care for COVID-19 patients. Hospital indicators in terms of COVID-19 screening services, as well as utilization patterns of inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators were computed. RESULTS: A total of 78,869 non-medical personnel and 2,176 medical personnel were presented with COVID-19 triage symptoms. Investigations conducted in the targeted 11 hospitals delineated that 22.2% of non-medical personnel and 27.9% of medical personnel were COVID-19 PCR-confirmed cases. The inpatient bed occupancy rate was 70% for non-medical patients and 67% for medical staff patients. For ICU, the bed occupancy rate was 92 % for non-medical patients and 88% for medical patients. Among the confirmed cases, 38% of medical patients utilized a ventilator vs. 36% of medical personnel cases. Hospital ranking according to utilization pattern among non-medical personnel, Hospital H ranked first in terms of the high load of screening services. Hospital C ranked first regarding the number of confirmed cases, whereas Hospital D ranked first for high ICU utilization among all teaching hospital ICU cases. With respect to medical personnel, Hospital G ranked first for the high load of screening services for the total studied cases. Hospital G ranked first for the number of confirmed cases.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy, Germany, Spain, and New York City over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late June 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 14.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two-thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 14.0% between March 9 and June 30, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well-designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","output":"Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Literature review shows that little research has done so far to estimate how tourism indicators are affected by new High Speed Rail (HSR) lines.

The Chinese experience confirmed that, during the period 1999-2010, emerging high speed rail services did have significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China.

The aim of this paper is to analyze and validate the suitability of this tool to assess empirically the effects of HSR on Spanish tourism during the period 1999-2014, and to enhance the abovementioned model with a tourism database. With more than 20 years HSR experience, and operating the longest HSR network in Europe (2,900 km), Spain offers a good scenario for this model application because Spanish tourism sector represents 10.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Results clearly show that there is a direct linkage between the evolution of certain Spanish tourism outputs and the construction of the HSR network.

Three pigs were killed at the same day; 2 pigs, at 2 days; 2 pigs, at 2 weeks; 2 pigs, at 4 weeks; and 2 pigs, at 8 weeks. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed in all pigs initially and thereafter at selected intervals. Pathological sections were performed for correlation. Initial CT scans were analyzed for lesions for degree of circumferential contact (< 25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and 76%-100%) to the hepatic veins for analysis of any contour deformity. The hepatic veins were also analyzed for any thrombus and for any narrowing. Those lesions with follow-up scans were also analyzed for changes over time. RESULTS Twenty-three lesions showed contiguity to the hepatic veins between 3 to 9 mm in size at the initial CT. No contour deformity due to perivascular tissue sparing is detected for any lesion. There was no thrombus detected in any vessel at any time point. Vessel narrowing was seen in 9 of 23 veins on the initial CT, all less than 50% in diameter and all with lesion contact of greater than 25% in circumference, but 2 of 3 veins with follow-up scans showed return-to-normal caliber. No late narrowing of any hepatic vein was seen on the long-term follow-up.

Those with positive rRT-PCR or highly clinically suspicious patients with typical chest CT scan pulmonary manifestations were considered confirmed COVID-19 for additional analyses. Patients, based on outcome, were categorized into outpatient, ordinary-ward admitted, intensive care unit (ICU) admitted, and deceased; their demographic, clinical, and chest CT scan parameters were compared. The pulmonary chest CT scan features were scaled with a novel semi-quantitative scoring system to assess pulmonary involvement (PI). RESULTS: Chest CT scans of 739 patients (mean age = 49.2  17.2 years old, 56.7% male) were reviewed; 491 (66.4%), 176 (23.8%), and 72 (9.7%) cases were managed outpatient, in an ordinary ward, and ICU, respectively. A total of 439 (59.6%) patients were confirmed COVID-19 cases; their most prevalent chest CT scan features were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (93.3%), pleural-based peripheral distribution (60.3%), and multi-lobar (79.7%), bilateral (76.6%), and lower lobes (RLL and/or LLL) (89.1%) involvement. Patients with lower SpO2, advanced age, RR, total PI score or PI density score, and diffuse distribution or involvement of multi-lobar, bilateral, or lower lobes were more likely to be ICU admitted/expired.

Droplets from deep lungs are especially infectious because the alveoli are the major sites of coronavirus replication. However, their exhalation fraction, size distribution, and exiting speeds are unclear. This study investigated the behavior and fate of respiratory droplets (0.1C4 m) during coughs in a single-path respiratory tract model extending from terminal alveoli to mouth opening. An experimentally measured cough waveform was used to control the alveolar wall motions and the flow boundary conditions at lung branches from G2 to G18. The mouth opening was modeled after the image of a coughing subject captured using a high-speed camera. A well-tested k- turbulence model and Lagrangian particle tracking algorithm were applied to simulate cough flow evolutions and droplet dynamics under four cough depths, i.e., tidal volume ratio (TVR) = 0.13, 0.20. 0.32, and 0.42. The results show that 2-m droplets have the highest exhalation fraction, regardless of cough depths. A nonlinear relationship exists between the droplet exhalation fraction and cough depth due to a complex deposition mechanism confounded by multiscale airway passages, multiregime flows, and drastic transient flow effects. The highest exhalation fraction is 1.6% at the normal cough depth (TVR = 0.32), with a mean exiting speed of 20 m/s. The finding that most exhaled droplets from deep lungs are 2 m highlights the need for more effective facemasks in blocking 2-m droplets and smaller both in infectious source control and self-protection from airborne virus-laden droplets.","output":"SARS COV-2 virus-laden droplets coughed from deep lungs: Numerical quantification in a single-path whole respiratory tract geometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological data in COVID-19 mortality indicate that men are more prone to die of SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, but biological causes for this sexual dimorphism are unknown.

The female sex hormones and the immune stimulatory genes, including Toll-like receptors, interleukins, and micro-RNAs present on X-chromosome, may impart lesser infectivity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 in females over males. The sex hormone estrogen interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, one of the most critical pathways in COVID-19 infectivity, and modulates the vasomotor homeostasis. Testosterone on the contrary enhances the levels of the two most critical molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2), transcriptionally and posttranslationally, thereby increasing viral load and delaying viral clearance in men as compared with women.

The CT findings were retrospectively analyzed according to the age groups and gender. RESULTS: Under 20 years of age, except for the ground-glass opacity and consolidation, no other finding was observed. Airway changes and crazy-paving pattern were more common over 80 years. While the tree-in-bud pattern was more common in the 20-29 age group than in other age groups, the halo sign was mostly seen at the age of 30-39 years. Unlike other groups, the thin reticular pattern was more common in patients aged 60-79 years. When the findings were compared by gender, the rates of centrilobular nodules (p=0.006), airway changes (p=0.004), and tree-in-bud pattern (p=0.050) were significantly higher in males than in females.

There are benefits to neoadjuvant therapy, such as monitoring for response, as well as an increased rate of breast conservation and reduction of potential morbidity associated with breast surgery, including axillary management. Among patients with highly proliferative tumors, such as HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer, those with residual disease are at higher risk of recurrence, which informs the recommended systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting. For instance, in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy, there is a role for adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine for those with residual disease at the time of surgery. The same holds true regarding the role of adjuvant capecitabine in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With the added complexities of treating patients in the era of the COVID-19 outbreak, additional considerations are critical, including initiation of surgery within an appropriate time from completion of neoadjuvant therapy.

However, the role of surgery in patients with persistent N2 disease is still controversial. This study aims to detail the diagnostic problems, prognostic features, and long-term survival of the persistent N2 non-small cell lung cancer patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS One-hundred fifty patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and subsequently underwent resection, in-between 2003 and 2015, were retrospectively analyzed. In this study, \\"persistent N2\\" group refers to patients who received neoadjuvant therapy for clinically or histologically proven N2, who underwent a surgery after having been classified as \\"downstaged\\" at restaging, but in whom ypN2 lesions were subsequently confirmed on the operative specimens. Patients with multistation N2 were included in the study. There were 119 patients who met the criteria, whereas persistent ypN2 was detected in 28.5% (n = 34) of all patients. RESULTS Overall 5-year survival rate was 47.2%, while it was 23.4% for patients with persistent N2. Factors that adversely affected survival were to have nonsquamous cell histological type (p = 0.006), high ypT stage (p = 0.001), persistent N2 (p = 0.02), and recurrence during follow-up (p < 0.001). A trend toward a shorter survival was observed when the ypN2 zone was subcarinal versus other zones, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). In addition, a trend toward a shorter survival of patients with multiple N2 involvement (p = 0.412) was observed.

Three perinatal SARS-CoV-2 transmissions with mild symptoms in affected neonates were recorded (two cases confirmed by PCR, the third one based on clinical findings).

Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that public firms with high pre-pandemic WFH index values had significantly higher sales, net incomes, and stock returns than their peers during the pandemic. Our results indicate that firms with higher digital resilience, as measured through our pre-pandemic WFH index, performed significantly better in general, and in non-essential industries in particular, where WFH feasibility was necessary to continue operation. The ability to use digital technologies to work remotely also mattered more in non-high-tech industries than in high-tech ones. Lastly, we find evidence that firms with lower pre-pandemic WFH feasibility attempted to catch up to their more resilient competitors via greater software investment. This is consistent with a complementarity between digital technologies and WFH practices.

This is especially true as we are encountering variants of concern (VOC) with increased transmissibility and vaccination breakthroughs. Microbial co-infections are being investigated as one of the crucial factors for exacerbation of disease severity and complications of COVID-19. A key question remains whether early transcriptionally active microbial signature/s in COVID-19 patients can provide a window for future disease severity susceptibility and outcome? Using complementary metagenomics sequencing approaches, respiratory virus oligo panel (RVOP) and Holo-seq, our study highlights the possible functional role of nasopharyngeal early resident transcriptionally active microbes in modulating disease severity, within recovered patients with sub-phenotypes (mild, moderate, severe) and mortality. The integrative analysis combines patients' clinical parameters, SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analysis, microbial differential composition, and their functional role. The clinical sub-phenotypes analysis led to the identification of transcriptionally active bacterial species associated with disease severity. We found significant transcript abundance of Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Bacillus cereus in the mortality, Leptotrichia buccalis in the severe, Veillonella parvula in the moderate, and Actinomyces meyeri and Halomonas sp. in the mild COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the metabolic pathways, distinguishing the microbial functional signatures between the clinical sub-phenotypes, were also identified. We report a plausible mechanism wherein the increased transcriptionally active bacterial isolates might contribute to enhanced inflammatory response and co-infections that could modulate the disease severity in these groups. Current study provides an opportunity for potentially using these bacterial species for screening and identifying COVID-19 patient sub-groups with severe disease outcome and priority medical care. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is invariably a disease of diverse clinical manifestation, with multiple facets involved in modulating the progression and outcome. In this regard, we investigated the role of transcriptionally active microbial co-infections as possible modulators of disease pathology in hospital admitted SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Specifically, can there be early nasopharyngeal microbial signatures indicative of prospective disease severity? Based on disease severity symptoms, the patients were segregated into clinical sub-phenotypes: mild, moderate, severe (recovered), and mortality. We identified significant presence of transcriptionally active isolates, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Bacillus cereus in the mortality patients. Importantly, the bacterial species might contribute toward enhancing the inflammatory responses as well as reported to be resistant to common antibiotic therapy, which together hold potential to alter the disease severity and outcome.","output":"Increased Abundance of Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Bacillus cereus in Upper Airway Transcriptionally Active Microbiome of COVID-19 Mortality Patients Indicates Role of Co-Infections in Disease Severity and Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many experimental surgerical procedures have been perfomed in the analyse of the phenomenon of brain trophism and plasticity, however undesirable intercorrence can occour leading to specific changes in the results that should be taken into attention.

Rats were submitted to incomplete global cerebral ischemia (IGCI) by occlusion of the bilateral carotid arteries for 30 minutes. During the IGCI surgical, some rats received a higher dose of the chloral hydrate anaesthesia which promoted a cardiogenic interruption of the blood flow (CIBF) for a period of 10 minutes followed by and prompt reperfusion. During that period, animals were submited to a cardiac massage and ventilated. Sham operation were made in control animals. Rats were killed and their brains processed 14 days after the surgery. The animals that have received a IGCI showed a slight astroglial and microglial reaction in all subfields of the hippocampal formation, however the animal submitted to CIBF showed a massive infiltration of the reactive astrocyte and microglia in CA1 subfield. This results demonstrated that a transient occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries leads to activation of glial cells in the hippocampus, however this response can be remarkable changed in animal developing a transient systemic hypoperfusion during surgery.

Some works have highlighted pathological changes on lung microvasculature with local pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy that may explain pulmonary artery thrombosis found on pulmonary computed tomography (CT) angiography. The objective of our study was to describe lung perfusion disorders assessed by pulmonary dual-energy CT (DECT) angiography in severe COVID-19 patients. Methods This single center retrospective study included 85 consecutive patients with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 who underwent a pulmonary DECT angiography between March 16th 2020 and April 22th 2020. Pulmonary DECT angiography was performed when the patient had severe clinical symptoms or suffered from active neoplasia or immunosuppression. Two chest radiologists performed pulmonary angiography analysis in search of pulmonary artery thrombosis and a blinded semi quantitative analysis of iodine color maps focusing on the presence of parenchymal ischemia. The lung parenchyma was divided into volumes based on HU values. DECT analysis included lung segmentation, total lungs volume and distribution of lung perfusion assessment. Results Twenty-nine patients (34%) were diagnosed with pulmonary artery thrombosis, mainly segmental (83%). Semi-quantitative analysis revealed parenchymal ischemia in 68% patients of the overall population, with no significant difference regarding absence or presence of pulmonary artery thrombosis (23 vs. 35, P=0.144). Inter-reader agreement of parenchymal ischemia between reader 1 and 2 was substantial [0.74; interquartile range (IQR): 0.59-0.89]. Volume of ischemia was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary artery thrombosis [29 (IQR, 8-100) vs. 8 (IQR, 0-45) cm3, P=0.041]. Lung parenchyma was divided between normal parenchyma (59%, of which 34% was hypoperfused), ground glass opacities (10%, of which 20% was hypoperfused) and consolidation (31%, of which 10% was hypoperfused). Conclusions Pulmonary perfusion evaluated by iodine concentration maps shows extreme heterogeneity in COVID-19 patients and lower iodine levels in normal parenchyma. Pulmonary ischemic areas were more frequent and larger in patients with pulmonary artery thrombosis. Pulmonary DECT angiography revealed a significant number of pulmonary ischemic areas even in the absence of visible pulmonary arterial thrombosis.

Questionnaires are usually built de novo for each event, resulting in substantially delayed epidemiological responses that are detrimental to the understanding and control of the event considered. Moreover, the public health and/or academic institution databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires are usually difficult to merge, impairing necessary collaborations. We aimed to show that e-commerce concepts and software tools can be readily adapted to enable rapid collection of data after an infectious disease outbreak or environmental disaster. Here, the customers are the epidemiologists, who fill their shopping baskets with standardised questions. METHODS: For each epidemiological field, a catalogue of questions is constituted by identifying the relevant variables based on a review of the published literature on similar circumstances. Each question is tagged with information on its source papers. Epidemiologists can then tailor their own questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from this catalogue. The software immediately provides them with ready-to-use forms and online questionnaires. All databases constituted by the different EpiBasket users are interoperable, because the corresponding questionnaires are derived from the same corpus of questions. RESULTS: A proof-of-concept prototype was developed for Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) surveys, which is one of the fields of the epidemiological investigation frequently explored during, or after, an outbreak or environmental disaster. The catalogue of questions was initiated from a review of the KAP studies conducted during or after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.

This vulnerability may have substantially increased during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic which might have affected students' socio-economic situation but possibly also their mental well-being. We examined whether the financial situation changed during the COVID-19 pandemic among German university students, and whether changes were associated with mental well-being. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in May and July 2020 at five German universities. Participants were asked, if they had sufficient financial resources to cover monthly expenses before and during the pandemic. The answer options were dichotomized into worsened and no change/better financial situation compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D 8 scale. For examining associations between sociodemographic, study-related, and financial factors and worsened financial situation, we ran a generalized linear mixed model. To assess associations between depressive symptoms and worsened financial situation, we performed a linear mixed model. Results: We included 7,199 participants in the analyses (69% female, 30% male, 1% diverse, mean age: 24 years, standard deviation: 4.7). Overall, 25% of the participants reported to have a worsened financial situation at the time of the survey than in the time before COVID-19. Factors associated with a worsened financial situation were migration background, parents not being academics, not being able to borrow money, and payment of tuition fee by student and loan [odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.20 to 2.35]. Factors associated with lower odds were: being single, living with others, studying a health-related field, being enrolled in a doctoral/Ph.D. or state exam program, and publicly funded tuition/tuition paid with a scholarship (OR ranging from 0.42 to 0.80). A worsened financial situation was associated with 1.02 points more on the CES-D 8 scale (95% CI: 0.80C1.24).

Several months have passed since the pandemic has struck. However, the world is still looking for an effective treatment plan to battle the viral infection. The first vaccine just received emergency approval in December 2020 for use in USA and UK. These are excellent news, however, the worldwide distribution of such vaccine, the possibility of virus mutation and the lack of data regarding the long-term effects of such vaccines are a significant concern. In addition, although remdesivir was recently approved by the FDA to be used as a clinical drug against COVID-19, it hasnt stood out yet as a proven form of therapeutics. Such inability to produce a novel therapy has caused enough inconveniences for the affected people worldwide. Repurposing the already available drugs to fight against the virus seems to be a reasonable option amidst such uncertainty. Given the vast collection of potential treatment candidates to be explored against COVID-19, there is a decent chance that a success in this regard will serve the intermediary purpose of clinically treating the infection until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed worldwide and will be able to treat COVID-19 patients that do not adequately respond to vaccines. Such treatments may prove very useful in future coronavirus outbreaks too. Proper research into these repurposing treatments may yield a certain insight into the field of novel treatment production as well. This review study accumulates a relevant set of information about drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, in terms of their repurposing properties and the specific phases of clinical trials they are undergoing across the world. A potential timeline is also suggested to estimate when an effective result can be expected from the ongoing clinical trials for a better anticipation of the drug landscape. This study will hopefully help accelerate investment of resources into development and discovery of drugs and vaccines against the infection.","output":"Drug Repurposing for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: A Clinical Landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work introduces a new socially assistive robot termed MARIA T21 (meaning Mobile Autonomous Robot for Interaction with Autistics, with the addition of the acronym T21, meaning Trisomy 21, which is used to designate individuals with Down syndrome). This new robot is used in psychomotor therapies for children with Down syndrome (contributing to improve their proprioception, postural balance, and gait) as well as in psychosocial and cognitive therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder. The robot uses, as a novelty, an embedded mini-video projector able to project Serious Games on the floor or tables to make already-established therapies funnier to these children, thus creating a motivating and facilitating effect for both children and therapists. The Serious Games were developed in Python through the library Pygame, considering theoretical bases of behavioral psychology for these children, which are integrated into the robot through the robot operating system (ROS). Encouraging results from the childCrobot interaction are shown, according to outcomes obtained from the application of the Goal Attainment Scale. Regarding the Serious Games, they were considered suitable based on both the Guidelines for Game Design of Serious Games for Children and the Evaluation of the Psychological Bases used during the games development. Thus, this pilot study seeks to demonstrate that the use of a robot as a therapeutic tool together with the concept of Serious Games is an innovative and promising tool to help health professionals in conducting therapies with children with autistic spectrum disorder and Down syndrome. Due to health issues imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sample of children was limited to eight children (one child with typical development, one with Trisomy 21, both female, and six children with ASD, one girl and five boys), from 4 to 9 years of age. For the non-typically developing children, the inclusion criterion was the existence of a conclusive diagnosis and fulfillment of at least 1 year of therapy. The protocol was carried out in an infant psychotherapy room with three video cameras, supervised by a group of researchers and a therapist. The experiments were separated into four steps: The first stage was composed of a robot introduction followed by an approximation between robot and child to establish eye contact and assess proxemics and interaction between child/robot. In the second stage, the robot projected Serious Games on the floor, and emitted verbal commands, seeking to evaluate the childs susceptibility to perform the proposed tasks. In the third stage, the games were performed for a certain time, with the robot sending messages of positive reinforcement to encourage the child to accomplish the game. Finally, in the fourth stage, the robot finished the games and said goodbye to the child, using messages aiming to build a closer relationship with the child.","output":"A New Socially Assistive Robot with Integrated Serious Games for Therapies with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Down Syndrome: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Existing mental health apps are largely not aimed at generally healthy young people who may be experimenting with addictive substances and mind-altering experiences. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the interest and expectations of young people regarding a proposed smartphone app designed to help protect and promote mental health and resilience in the face of risks associated with substance use. METHODS: The study was based on agile system development and had 3 empirical substudies. Our feasibility study (study 1) included an anonymous questionnaire that examined the potential interest of young people in this type of app. It was answered by 339 Israelis aged 18-30 years. The second part of the feasibility study was a pilot study with 1.2% (4/339) of the people who answered the questionnaire and expressed interest in participating in a focus group. They tested and refined the elements planned for the focus groups. Study 2 was a participatory design study involving 7 focus groups of 5 to 7 participants each (young people aged 18-35 years, n=38). Persona development, open discussion, and a Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire were used to elicit user expectations and requirements for the app and to understand the perceived usefulness and usability of the proposed features. Study 3 comprised in-depth interviews with experts in the field of youth mental health and drug use to enlist their professional opinion regarding the value of such an app and recommendations about the features it should include. RESULTS: The mock-up for the proposed app had five key features: personalized assessment of risk for a drug-associated mental crisis, support for self-monitoring, useful information (eg, warning signs and first-aid guidelines), resilience-building exercises, and a support center. Participants rated highly the usefulness of all 5 main features and 96% (24/25) of the specific features we proposed within those main categories. The participants also suggested additional features as well as a new user persona we had not considered: the parents or family members of the young person. The focus groups rated highly the perceived usability of the app. Most of the experts saw value in all the main features and suggested specific knowledge sources for the apps content. Finally, participants of both the feasibility study and the participatory design study expressed moderate to high interest in using the app for self-help and high interest in using the app to help friends. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide preliminary encouraging support for the 5 main features suggested by the research team and reinforce recommendations for mobile health apps found in the literature. The findings emphasize the insight that this kind of app should be designed primarily for use by individuals seeking to help others.","output":"Participatory Design of a Mobile App to Safeguard Mental Resilience in the Context of Drug Use in Young Adults: Multi-Method Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a disease that emerged in Wuhan, China on January 7, 2020, and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization However, there is no specific treatment and management protocol for COVID-19, which has led to a high mortality and morbidity in our country and worldwide This case report aimed to describe the nursing care of a patient who was admitted to the hospital with high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and respiratory problems and diagnosed as COVID-19 The nursing diagnoses of the patient were made according to the 10th edition of NANDA and patient care was conducted in accordance with the Gordon Health Patterns Model (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Koronavirs hastal-19 (COV&Iacute;D-19), ilk kez 29 Aral?k 2019 tarihinde ?in'in Wuhan kentinde ortaya km, ilk tan? 7 Ocak 2020 tarihinde koyulmu?tur Bu nedenle COV&Iacute;D-19 ad?n? almt?r 11 Mart 2020 tarihinde ise Dnya Sa?l?k ?rgt taraf?ndan pandemi olarak ilan edilmi?tir Ancak dnyada oldu?u gibi lkemizde de yksek morbidite ve mortalitiye yol a?an COV&Iacute;D-19 hastalna y?nelik spesifik bir tedavi ve bak?m protokol bulunmamaktad?r Bu olgu sunumunda yksek ate?, ishal, kusma ve solunum problemleri ile hastaneye ba?vuran ve COV&Iacute;D-19 tan?s? konulan hastan?n hem?irelik bak?m?na y?nelik bilgi verilmesi ama?lanmt?r Hastan?n hem?irelik tan?lar?

Translational arrest is a common antiviral strategy used by hosts. In response, RVFV inhibits two well-known antiviral pathways that attenuate translation during infection, PKR and type I IFN signaling. Despite this, translational arrest occurs during RVFV infection by unknown mechanisms. Here, we find that RVFV infection triggers the decay of core translation machinery mRNAs that possess a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (5'-TOP) motif in their 5'-UTR, including mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which leads to a decrease in overall ribosomal protein levels. We find that the RNA decapping enzyme NUDT16 selectively degrades 5'-TOP mRNAs during RVFV infection and this decay is triggered in response to mTOR attenuation via the translational repressor 4EBP1/2 axis. Translational arrest of 5'-TOPs via 4EBP1/2 restricts RVFV replication, and this increased RNA decay results in the loss of visible RNA granules, including P bodies and stress granules. Because RVFV cap-snatches in RNA granules, the increased level of 5'-TOP mRNAs in this compartment leads to snatching of these targets, which are translationally suppressed during infection. Therefore, translation of RVFV mRNAs is compromised by multiple mechanisms during infection. Together, these data present a previously unknown mechanism for translational shutdown in response to viral infection and identify mTOR attenuation as a potential therapeutic avenue against bunyaviral infection.","output":"Virus-induced translational arrest through 4EBP1/2-dependent decay of 5'-TOP mRNAs restricts viral infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: On the grounds of their anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects, we hypothesized that SSRIs and SNRIs might be effective treatments for Covid-19. Methods: We examined the association of antidepressant use with intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death in time-to-event analyses adjusted for numerous potential confounders. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. Results: Of the 9,509 inpatients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 2,164 patients (22.8%) were excluded because of missing data or exclusion criterion (i.e. less than 18 years old of age). Of the remaining 7,345 adult inpatients, 460 patients (6.3%) received an antidepressant during the hospitalization. The primary endpoint occurred respectively in 143 patients exposed to antidepressants (31.1%) and 1,188 patients who were not (17.3%). After adjusting for the older age [74.8 (SD=15.5) versus 56.8 (SD=19.3); Welch's t-test=23.7; p<0.001] and the greater medical severity of patients receiving antidepressants, the primary analyses showed a significant negative association of the composite endpoint with exposure to any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; p<0.001), SSRIs (HR, 0.56; p<0.001), and SNRIs (HR, 0.57; p=0.034), but not with other antidepressant classes. Exposure to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine was significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses.

A reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for the study of limit of detection (LoD), which is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with an accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure.

Advances in biotechnologies make it possible to generate scRNA-seq profiles for large-scale cells, requiring effective and efficient clustering algorithms to identify cell types and informative genes. Although great efforts have been devoted to clustering of scRNA-seq, the accuracy, scalability and interpretability of available algorithms are not desirable. In this study, we solve these problems by developing a joint learning algorithm [a.k.a. joints sparse representation and clustering (jSRC)], where the dimension reduction (DR) and clustering are integrated. Specifically, DR is employed for the scalability and joint learning improves accuracy. To increase the interpretability of patterns, we assume that cells within the same type have similar expression patterns, where the sparse representation is imposed on features. We transform clustering of scRNA-seq into an optimization problem and then derive the update rules to optimize the objective of jSRC. Fifteen scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of jSRC, where the number of single cells varies from 49 to 110 824.

We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of two COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. RESULTS: 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (OR(Mortality)=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.710 (-13)) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for pre-existing disease s/conditions at baseline (OR(M)=1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p=3.110 (-8)) and at the early pandemic (OR(M)=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p=0.011) decreased the association. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions.","output":"Biological Aging Predicts Vulnerability to COVID-19 Severity in UK Biobank Participants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nasal packing is routinely used after septoplasty because it is believed to decrease risk of postoperative bleeding, hematomas, and adhesions. Multiple studies have shown, however, that there are numerous complications associated with nasal packing. The purpose of this work was to perform a meta-analysis on the existing literature to evaluate the role of nasal packing after septoplasty. METHODS Two independent reviewers conducted a literature search using EMBASE, OVID, Medline, PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane Library, and reference list review from 1966 to August 2010 to identify studies assessing nasal packing after septoplasty. All papers were reviewed for study design, results, and were assigned an Oxford level of evidence grade, Detsky score, and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) score. RESULTS Sixteen papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Eleven papers were randomized control trials, 3 were prospective, and 2 were retrospective studies. Nasal packing did not show benefit in reducing postoperative bleeding, hematomas, septal perforations, adhesions, or residual deviated nasal septum. There was, however, an increase in postoperative infections. Two studies using fibrin products as nasal packing showed a decreased bleeding rate. CONCLUSION Nasal packing after septoplasty does not show any postoperative benefits. Fibrin products show a possibility of decreasing postoperative bleeding.

The number of HLA-C-restricted HIV-1 epitopes identified is much smaller than those of HLA-A-restricted or HLA-B-restricted ones. Here, we utilized a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify HIV-1 peptides presented by HLA-C*14:03 protective and HLA-C*14:02 nonprotective alleles. We identified 25 8- to 11-mer HLA-I-bound HIV-1 peptides from HIV-1-infected HLA-C*14:02(+)/14:03(+) cells. Analysis of T cell responses to these peptides identified novel 6 T cell epitopes targeted in HIV-1-infected HLA-C*14:02(+)/14:03(+) subjects. Analyses using HLA stabilization assays demonstrated that all 6 epitope peptides exhibited higher binding to and greater cell surface stabilization of HLA-C*14:02 than HLA-C*14:03. T cell response magnitudes were typically higher in HLA-C*14:02(+) than HLA-C*14:03(+) individuals, with responses to the Pol KM9 and Nef epitopes being significantly higher. The results show that HLA-C*14:02 can elicit stronger T cell responses to HIV-1 than HLA-C*14:03 and suggest that the single amino acid difference between these HLA-C14 subtypes at position 21, outside the peptide-binding groove, indirectly influences the stability of peptide-HLA-C*14 complexes and induction/expansion of HIV-specific T cells. Taken together with a previous finding that KIR2DL2(+) NK cells recognized HLA-C*14:03(+) HIV-1-infected cells more than HLA-C*14:02(+) ones, the present study indicates that these HLA-C*14 subtypes differentially impact HIV-1 control by T cells and NK cells. IMPORTANCE Some human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with good clinical outcomes in HIV-1 infection and are called protective HLA alleles. Identification of T cell epitopes restricted by protective HLA alleles can give important insight into virus-immune system interactions and inform design of immune-based prophylactic/therapeutic strategies. Although epitopes restricted by many protective HLA-A/B alleles have been identified, protective HLA-C alleles are relatively understudied. Here, we identified 6 novel T cell epitopes presented by both HLA-C*14:02 (no association with protection) and HLA-C*14:03 (protective) using a mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome profiling approach. We found that these peptides bound to and stabilized HLA-C*14:02 better than HLA-C*14:03 and observed differences in induction/expansion of epitope-specific T cell responses in HIV-infected HLA-C*14:02(+) versus HLA-C*14:03(+) individuals. These results enhance understanding of how the microstructural difference at position 21 between these HLA-C*14 subtypes may influence cellular immune responses involved in viral control in HIV-1 infection.","output":"Impact of Micropolymorphism Outside the Peptide Binding Groove in the Clinically Relevant Allele HLA-C*14 on T Cell Responses in HIV-1 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations in metastatic head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (mHNcSCC).

Thus, the investigation of online social network services is of paramount importance. In this paper, we use the sentiment analysis, which detects attitudes and emotions toward issues of society posted in social media, to understand the actual economic situation. To this end, two steps are suggested. In the first step, after training the sentiment classifiers with several big data sources of social media datasets, we consider three types of feature sets: feature vector, sequence vector and a combination of dictionary-based feature and sequence vectors. Then, the performance of six classifiers is assessed: MaxEnt-L1, C4.5 decision tree, SVM-kernel, Ada-boost, Na?ve Bayes and MaxEnt. In the second step, we collect datasets that are relevant to several economic words that the public use to explicitly express their opinions. Finally, we use a vector auto-regression analysis to confirm our hypothesis. The results show the statistically significant relationship between public sentiment and economic performance. That is, depression and unemployment lead to KOSPI.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including the isolation of infected individuals, tracing and quarantine of exposed individuals are decisive tools to prevent onwards transmission and curb fatalities. Strategies that combine NPIs with SARS-CoV-2 testing may help to shorten quarantine durations while being non-inferior with respect to infection prevention. Thus, combined strategies can help reducing the socio-economic burden of SARS-CoV2 and generate greater public acceptance. We developed a software that enables policy makers to calculate the reduction in transmissibility through quarantine or isolation in combination with arbitrary testing strategies. The user chooses between three different modi [(i) isolation of infected individuals, (ii) management of potentially infected contacts and (iii) quarantine of incoming travelers], while having total flexibility in customizing testing strategies, as well as setting model parameters. The software enables decision makers to tailor calculations specifically to their questions and perform an assessment 'on the fly', based on current evidence on infection dynamics. Underneath, we analytically solve a stochastic transit compartment model of the infection time course, which captures temporal changes in test sensitivities, incubation- and infectious periods, as well as times to symptom onset using its default parameters. Using default parameters, we estimated that testing travelers at the point of entry reduces the risk about 4.69 (4.19,4.83) fold for PCR vs. 3.59 (3.22, 3.69) fold for based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT, 87% relative sensitivity) when combined with symptom screening. In comparison to 14 days of pure quarantine, 8 (PCR) vs. 10 (RDT) days of pre-test quarantine would be noninferior for incoming travelers as well as for contact person management.

This information may determine the health-seeking behavior of an individual and may delay medical attention. Little is known regarding the quality of patient information on appendicitis on the internet, as this has not been previously studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify the quality of information regarding appendicitis on websites intended for the public. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of information on appendicitis available online using the following 4 search terms in google: appendicitis, appendix, appendectomy, and appendicectomy. The top 100 websites of each search term were assessed using the validated Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool (score 0-36). RESULTS: A total of 119 websites met the eligibility criteria for evaluation. The overall median EQIP score for all websites was 20 (IQR 18-22). More than half the websites originated from the USA (65/119, 54.6%), and 45.4% (54/119) of all websites originated from hospitals, although 43% (23/54) of these did not mention qualitative risks from surgery. Incidence rates were only provided for complications and mortality in 12.6% (15/119) and 3.3% (4/119) of all websites, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of the quality and readability of websites concerning appendicitis by the EQIP tool indicates that most sites online were of poor credibility, with minimal information regarding complication rates and mortality.

Storage of medical data in the cloud is expanding, and ventilation can be monitored remotely. The aim of this bench study was to determine whether tidal volume (VT) can be affected by the location of supplemental oxygen placement. METHODS We tested 4 home ventilators in a bench test using a dual-chamber test lung to test the addition of supplemental oxygen placement via a connector in the circuit (ie, front intake port) versus via the manufacturer's rear intake port, with different oxygen supply flows of 2, 4, 6, and 8 L/min. We compared the effectively delivered VT as measured with a pneumotachograph (ie, measured VT) versus the VT reported by each home ventilator (ie, monitored VT). RESULTS For all of the home ventilators, the monitored VT and measured VT were comparable when the rear oxygen intake was used, regardless of oxygen flow. However, when the front oxygen intake was used, the monitored VT as measured by the ventilators was significantly lower than the measured VT, with the greatest difference reaching 29% for the highest oxygen flow tested (8 L/min). CONCLUSIONS The monitored VT may be inaccurate if oxygen is added with a connector in the circuit, which may have consequences on both the individual level and collective level (ie, big data analysis).

The model, trained on chemically diverse compounds, has above 80% accuracy on several test sets. Our results suggest that about 25% of drugs are predicted to be very bitter, with even higher prevalence (~40%) in COVID19 drug candidates and in microbial natural products. Only ~10% of toxic molecules are predicted to be intensely bitter, and it is also suggested that intense bitterness does not correlate with hepatotoxicity of drugs. However, very bitter compounds may be more cardiotoxic than not very bitter compounds, possessing significantly lower QPlogHERG values. BitterIntense allows quick and easy prediction of strong bitterness of compounds of interest for food, pharma and biotechnology industries. We estimate that implementation of BitterIntense or similar tools early in drug discovery process may lead to reduction in delays, in animal use and in overall financial burden.","output":"Intense bitterness of molecules: Machine learning for expediting drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic has induced a global health crisis, which requires more in-depth investigation into immunological responses to develop effective treatments and vaccines. To understand protective immunity against COVID-19, we screened over 60,000 asymptomatic individuals in the Southeastern United States for IgG antibody positivity against the viral spike protein, and approximately three percent were positive. Of these three percent, individuals with the highest anti-S or anti-RBD IgG level showed a strong correlation with inhibition of ACE2 binding and cross-reactivity against non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus S-proteins. We also analyzed samples from 94 SARS-CoV-2 patients and compared them to asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients had decreased antibody responses, ACE2 binding inhibition, and antibody cross-reactivity. Our study shows that healthy individuals can mount robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms.

Neutrophils are now recognized as a key cell type mediating early graft injury, which activates further innate immune responses and intensifies acquired immunity and alloimmunity. Since the macrolide Bryostatin-1 has been shown to block neutrophil transmigration, we aimed to determine whether these findings could be translated to the field of kidney transplantation. To study the effects of Bryostatin-1 on ischemia-elicited neutrophil transmigration, an in vitro model of hypoxia and normoxia was equipped with human endothelial cells and neutrophils. To translate these findings, a porcine renal autotransplantation model with eight hours of reperfusion was used to study neutrophil infiltration in vivo. Graft-specific treatment using Bryostatin-1 (100 nM) was applied during static cold storage. Bryostatin-1 dose-dependently blocked neutrophil activation and transmigration over ischemically challenged endothelial cell monolayers. When applied to porcine renal autografts, Bryostatin-1 reduced neutrophil graft infiltration, attenuated histological and ultrastructural damage, and improved renal function. Our novel findings demonstrate that Bryostatin-1 is a promising pharmacological candidate for graft-specific treatment in kidney transplantation, as it provides protection by blocking neutrophil infiltration and attenuating functional graft injury.","output":"Bryostatin-1 Attenuates Ischemia-Elicited Neutrophil Transmigration and Ameliorates Graft Injury after Kidney Transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With respect to reopening the economy as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions, governmental response and messaging have been inconsistent, and policies have varied by state as this is a uniquely polarizing topic.

Objective To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. Results Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period;18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1%, had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%. Teleconsultation overall satisfaction level was 9 (IQI 8?10), and 61.5% of respondents consider teleconsultation as a \\"health care option\\" after the healthcare crisis.

Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic. Objective: To study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model. Main Outcome measures: In-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Results: Fifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI/ARB users. Conclusion: There is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI/ARB compared with non-users. In patients with hypertension, ACE/ARB use might be associated with reduced mortality, however these findings need to be confirmed in prospective randomized controlled trials.","output":"Association of Renin Angiotensin System Blockers with Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly recognized in the outbreak of COVID-19, especially during the emergence of Omicron variant.

In this study, we aimed to compare music therapy to a control (no music) group with respect to sedation requirements, anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Methods In this randomized controlled study, we compared the effect of music therapy in patients  18 years old. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were screened for the study to rule out any contraindications for spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio for either the \\"music\\" or \\"control\\" group. Both groups were compared for sedation requirements, preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction. Results Subjects in the music group had a statistically significant lower than average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State baseline score as compared to the control group (music group 31.00 (standard deviation (SD) 1.44), control group 38.04 (SD 2.35); p = 0.01). Postoperative STAI-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State scores for the music group were lower for the music group than the control group (music group 28.34 (SD 1.64), control group 32.21 (SD 1.56), p= 0.09). STAI-Trait scores were similar pre-operatively, but significantly less post-operatively in the music group (28.14 SD 1.0) as compared to the control group (34.71 SD 2.31); p = 0.01.

The mechanisms of many events induced by NO are now well defined, so that a fundamental understanding of NO biology is almost established. Accumulated evidence suggests that NO and oxygen radicals such as superoxide are key molecules in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases. NO biosynthesis, particularly through expression of an inducible NO synthase (iNOS), occurs in a variety of microbial infections. Although antimicrobial activity of NO is appreciated for bacteria and protozoa, NO has opposing effects in virus infections such as influenza virus pneumonia and certain other neurotropic virus infections. iNOS produces an excessive amount of NO for long periods, which allows generation of a highly reactive nitrogen oxide species, peroxynitrite, via a radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide. Thus, peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules. NO also appears to affect a host's immune response, with immunopathological consequences. For example, overproduction of NO in virus infections in mice is reported to suppress type 1 helper T-cell-dependent immune responses, leading to type 2 helper T-cell-biased immunological host responses. Thus, NO may be a host response modulator rather than a simple antiviral agent. The unique biological properties of NO are further illustrated by our recent data suggesting that viral mutation and evolution may be accelerated by NO-induced oxidative stress. Here, we discuss these multiple roles of NO in pathogenesis of virus infections as related to both non-specific inflammatory responses and immunological host reactions modulated by NO during infections in vivo.","output":"Nitric oxide and virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has been demonstrated; however, emerging evidence suggests insufficient protection in certain immunocompromised cancer patients.

In the present study, we applied this system for targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (CoV-2-S) by using CoV-2-S-expressing aAVCs (aAVC-CoV-2) and evaluated the immune response in a murine model. A single dose of aAVC-CoV-2 induced a large amount of CoV-2-S-specific, multifunctional CTLs in addition to CD4+ T cell-dependent anti-CoV-2-S-specific Abs. CoV-2-S-specific CTLs infiltrated the lung parenchyma and persisted as long-term memory T cells. Furthermore, we immunized mice with CoV-2-S- and tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-co-expressing aAVCs (aAVC-TAA/CoV-2) and evaluated whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 and antitumor CTLs were elicited. We found that the aAVC-TAA/CoV-2-S therapy exerted apparent antitumor effects and induced CoV-2-S-specific CTLs.

The ethanol extract was fractionated into n-hexane and further analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to obtain information regarding the compounds contained in betel fruit. Each compounds potential antimalarial activity was evaluated using AutoDock Vina and compared to artemisinin, an antimalarial drug. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) were performed to evaluate the stability of the interaction between the ligand and receptors. Results detected 20 probable compounds in the n-hexane extract of betel fruit based on GC-MS analysis. The docking study revealed that androstan-17-one,3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5 alpha)- has the highest binding affinity for plasmepsin 1 and plasmepsin 2. The compound exhibits a similar interaction with artemisinin at the active site of the receptors. The compound does not violate Lipinskis rules of five. It belongs to class 5 toxicity with an LD(50) of 3000 mg/kg. MDS results showed stable interactions between the compound and the receptors.

Human bocavirus (HBoV), a novel virus, is recognized to increasingly associate with previously unknown etiology respiratory infections in young children. In this study, the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HBoV infections were described in hospitalized Vietnamese pediatric patients. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from patients with acute respiratory infections at the Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for HBoV by PCR and further molecularly characterized by sequencing. HBoV was found in 78 (7.2%) children. Co\\\\infection with other viruses was observed in 66.7% of patients infected with HBoV. Children 12C24 months old were the most affected age group. Infections with HBoV were found year\\\\round, though most cases occurred in the dry season (DecemberCApril). HBoV was possible to cause severe diseases as determined by higher rates of hypoxia, pneumonia, and longer hospitalization duration in patients with HBoV infection than in those without (P\\\\value <0.05). Co\\\\infection with HBoV did not affect the disease severity. The phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 gene showed minor variations and all HBoV sequences belonged to species 1 (HBoV1). In conclusion, HBoV1 was circulating in Vietnam and detected frequently in young children during dry season. Acute respiratory infections caused by HBoV1 were severe enough for hospitalization, which implied that HBoV1 may have an important role in acute respiratory infections among children. J. Med.

All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and a large proportion of them were diagnosed with severe illness when admitted. Due to the overwhelming of our system, a total of 14 patients (17.1%) were treated in the ICU, 83% of deaths never received Critical Care Support, only 40% had mechanical ventilation support despite 100% needing oxygen and the leading cause of death being pulmonary. Most of the patients who died were male (65.9%). More than half of the patients who died were older than 60 years (80.5%), and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of the patients who died had comorbidities (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), followed by sepsis/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhagic, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed.

Due to expert recommendations, high-dose rocuronium (HDR) has become a commonly used pre-intubation neuromuscular blocking agent. Aim: We conducted this retrospective caseCcontrol observational study with the hypothesis that high-dose rocuronium was not associated with higher incidence of PICA. Methods: We included 93 patients who were intubated using the rapid sequence intubation (RSI) technique with rocuronium for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted from March 2020 to February 2021 to a tertiary care hospital in North Carolina, USA. The patients were grouped based on high (1.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight and above) versus low (<1.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight) dose rocuronium used for RSI. The differences of the various outcomes between the groups were analyzed. Results: The baseline demographics were similar in both groups except for higher body mass index in high-dose group 39 versus 32 (kg/m2), p = 0.009. There was a total of six PICA events (6.45%). The HDR group had 8.0% of PICA versus 4.7% in the low-dose group. In-hospital mortality was 60.0% in the HDR group versus 72.1% in the low-dose group. Conclusion: The incidence of PICA in COVID-19 patients with ARDS who were intubated using the RSI technique was higher than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Relevance for Patients: The use of high-dose paralytics during invasive ventilation with RSI and their consequences should be explored with the help of large-scale studies. The rate of PICA is still very low, and perhaps, the use of HDR is safe, as suggested by the expert panel.","output":"Risk of post-intubation cardiac arrest with the use of high-dose rocuronium in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Infection of mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an acute encephalomyelitis associated with primary demyelination of the central nervous system. Efforts at understanding the components of the immune response in the development of chronic MHV-induced demyelination have implicated the antibody response and both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. In this report, we demonstrate that Balb/c (H-2) mice immunized with the JHM (JHMV) strain of MHV develop a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. One population of these virus-specific CTL recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing either the entire N protein or carboxy-terminal deletions were used to determine the number and location of the epitope(s) recognized. The CTLs were found to recognize a peptide contained within the carboxy-terminal 149 amino acids of the N protein. Analysis of infected cell lines expressing transfected major histocompatibility genes demonstrated that the anti-N protein CTLs were restricted exclusively to the L molecule. These data provide the first definition of a MHV-specific CTL response directed to a viral protein and suggest that the anti-N protein CTL response is one potential mechanism used by the host to clear JHMV from the central nervous system.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are Ld restricted and specific for the carboxy terminus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the application of touching combined with intelligent interaction of voice and rhythm in the nursing of neonatal feeding intolerance and its effect on the quality of life.

The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the study group. The control group received touch nursing and the study group received touch combined with intelligent interactive nursing mode of voice, music, and rhythm. The general data, feeding performance, feeding process, growth and development, feeding intolerance, total intestinal feeding, jaundice duration, hospital stay, and quality of life scores were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: First of all, we compared the general data of the two groups. There was no significant difference in gestational age, sex, mode of delivery, birth weight, head circumference, body length, Apgar score, and other general data between the two groups. Second, we compared the feeding performance of the two groups. Before nursing, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). After nursing, the feeding rate, milk intake ratio, and proficiency of the two groups increased, and the comparison between the two groups. The feeding rate, milk intake ratio, and proficiency of the study group were better than those of the control group. In terms of the feeding process of the two groups, the days of oral feeding, complete import feeding, feeding conversion, and indwelling gastric tube in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In terms of the growth and development of the two groups, the recovery time of birth weight in the study group was lower than that in the control group, and the growth of body weight, length, and head circumference at 14 days in the study group was higher than those in the control group. The feeding intolerance, the duration of jaundice, and the days of hospitalization in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the feeding intolerance, the duration of jaundice, and the days of hospitalization in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

Adolescents have been especially affected with school closure and home confinement. The impact of the pandemic on sleep habits and quality of sleep and quality of life among adolescents have not been adequately characterized. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic induced an evening shift of the daily rhythm among adolescents and adversely affected sleep quality and quality of life of high school students. METHODS: Students were questioned about their usual bed and wake-up times and answered the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Ninety-four students (64% females, aged 15+1 years) participated in both phases of the study. Students delayed bed and wake-up times in 1.5[0.5-2.0] and 2.0[1.5-2.5]h, respectively. Chronotype (MEQ) shifted towards eveningness during the pandemic. Sleep duration increased and quality of sleep (PSQI) improved only among those students with shorter sleep duration before the pandemic. During the pandemic, the physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL worsened but the environmental domain improved as compared to the study before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: High school students delayed bed and wake-up times and shifted chronotype towards eveningness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Delaying diagnosis can lead to disease progression, but the impact of this delay on mortality is unknown. The COVID-19 infection rate at which immediate operative risk exceeds benefit is unknown. We sought to model immediate versus delayed surgical resection in a suspicious lung nodule <2 cm. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed, and sensitivity analyses performed. The base case was a 65-year-old male smoker with COPD presenting for surgical biopsy of 1.5-2.0 cm lung nodule highly suspicious for cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared immediate surgical resection to delayed resection after three months. The likelihood of key outcomes was derived from the literature where available. The outcome was 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: Immediate surgical resection resulted in a similar but slightly higher 5-year overall survival when compared to delayed resection (0.77 versus 0.74), due to the risk of disease progression. However, if the probability of acquired COVID-19 infection is greater than 13%, delayed resection is favorable (0.74 vs 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate surgical biopsy of lung nodules suspicious for cancer in hospitals with low COVID-19 prevalence likely results in improved 5-year survival. However, as the risk of perioperative COVID-19 infection increases above 13%, a delayed approach has similar or improved survival.

Dps has been shown to use both its ferritin and DNA-binding functions to respond to a variety of environmental pressures, including oxidative stress. One mechanism that allows Dps to achieve this is through a global nucleoid restructuring event during stationary phase, resulting in a compact, hexacrystalline nucleoprotein complex called the biocrystal that occludes damaging agents from DNA.

AIC-diagnosis is established retrospectively when LVSD normalizes or improves significantly over time following rhythm restoration. However, the prevalence and most importantly the time course of this relevant disease remain unclear and hence merit investigation to enable the correct diagnosis. PURPOSE: Therefore, our aim was to evaluate a) the occurrence of AIC in this clinical relevant cohort of patients with newly diagnosed and otherwise unexplainable LVSD and concomitant tachycardia and b) the time needed to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of AIC in order to facilitate a diagnostic algorithm. METHOD: We prospectively screened patients hospitalized for newly diagnosed and otherwise unexplainable LVSD (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%) and coexisting tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation/flutter + heart rate (HR) >100/min) in 3 cardiological centers. Coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were performed to exclude other causes for LVSD. Patients underwent a rhythm control strategy in accordance to the local clinical pathways. LVEF was assessed by echocardiography at presentation and at follow-up (FU) visits after 2, 4, and 6 months. Patients who lost sinus rhythm (SR) during FU were excluded. Patients with any increase of 15% in absolute EF or an EF 50% with an improvement of 10% after 6 months of FU were assigned to the AIC-group, which is a common definition of AIC. All others were assigned to an idiopathic DCM-group as final comparator. RESULTS: 68 patients were eligible, 18 of them were excluded: 1 lost to follow-up, 1 PCI, 2 COVID-19, 1 diagnosed cancer, 1 withdraw consent and 12 lost SR. Thus, our sample consists of a total of 50 patients. At presentation, meanSD HR was 12117/min. After rhythm therapy, HR normalized (6710/min) and LVEF increased in both groups, see fig. 1. Surprisingly, only 9 patients did not fulfill the AIC-criteria in this specific collective resulting in a prevalence of 82% (95%-CI: 68% C 92%). This high prevalence of AIC underlines the importance of the disease. 2 and 4 months after rhythm intervention, 58% and 73% of patients fulfilled AIC-criteria (fig. 2). The sensitivity for detection of AIC by echocardiographic LVEF-measurement at months 2 and 4 of FU was 65% and 86% with a specificity of 100%, emphasizing that a FU of 6 months is necessary to certainly distinguish between AIC and idiopathic DCM. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AIC in patients with newly diagnosed and otherwise unexplainable LVSD with concomitant tachycardia is 82%. Analysis of the time course of AIC clearly suggests that the final diagnosis cannot be established before 6 months after successful rhythm restoration. These results may help to improve diagnosis of AIC in daily clinical practice.

For untold years, individuals, households, villages and at times the entire communities get together to observe their various religious, cultural and community festivals. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic period, the practice of gathering to celebrate those festivals became a challenging practice. This is because density of population and intensity of social contacts are deemed to increase SARS-CoV-2 high transmissibility. In this paper, we analyzed the trend of COVID-19 active cases in Sarawak in the first half of the year 2021 and calibrated the parameter signifying the proportion of exposed population taking effective precautionary measures,. in our model. Our findings suggest that after every festival celebration the value of. is decreased, leading to the increased number of active cases. In addition, the pre-festival mobility change involving visits to the retail and grocery stores are higher than any other time. Therefore, the festival gatherings and increased pre-festival mobility are catalysts that accelerated the increment of the number of active COVID-19 cases in Sarawak. In light of this, we proposed that any form of festival related gathering ought to be avoided in order to curb any forms of outbreak in Sarawak.","output":"Sarawak Covid-19: Effects of Pre-festival Mobility and Festival Gatherings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Periodontal disease (PD) comprises a group of diseases involving inflammatory aspects of the host and dysbiotic events that affect periodontal tissues and could have systemic implications.

Households with young children who were not being breast-fed reported that they had reduced milk consumption by at least 1/3 in the immediate aftermath of the melamine disclosure and 39% reported that they cut out milk consumption altogether. A significantly higher percentage of households with children reported being concerned with the effects of melamine in milk and two communicable diseases: SARS and H1N1 influenza than were those with no children. A significantly higher percentage of households with no young children were concerned with the effects of Trace Sudan in chicken, Clenbuterol in pork, chicken eggs with red yolks, and excess iodine in milk powder than were those with young children. All households that reduced consumption of fluid milk following news of the melamine contamination reported a much greater concern with most food safety and health scares than did households that did not reduce consumption of fluid milk. Survey data revealed that most consumers had a relatively low level of knowledge of the Food Safety Law that went into effect just over three months before this survey was conducted.

We find that, in mouse, Lnc-Rewind acts as an epigenetic regulator of MuSC proliferation and expansion by influencing the expression of skeletal muscle genes and several components of the WNT (Wingless-INT) signalling pathway. Among them, we identified the nearby Wnt7b gene as a direct Lnc-Rewind target. We show that Lnc-Rewind interacts with the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase and mediates the in cis repression of Wnt7b by H3K9me2 deposition. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of adult muscle stem cells fate by lncRNAs.","output":"Epigenetic regulation of Wnt7b expression by the cis-acting long noncoding RNA Lnc-Rewind in muscle stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper uses a variety of analytic and computational models to assess the impact of university student social/study bubbles.

Observational studies and numerous randomized trials. Data sources: - Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number registry from 2011 to 2021. Vitamin D plays an essential role in maintaining bone health through regulating calcium concentrations in the body. The development of vitamin D deficiency is associated with deteriorating bone health and in severe cases, hypocalcemia, rickets, and osteomalacia in children and adults. Those at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency include patients with chronic illnesses (e.g., chronic kidney disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, and sickle cell disease), dark-pigmented skin, poor nutrition, and infants who are exclusively breastfed. The primary source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure with nutritional intake. However, the composite literature is often confusing and has led to heated debates about the optimal concentrations of vitamin D and related guidelines for supplementation. According to the last period of research, the impact of vitamin D is actively discussing the correct functioning of the immune system. It is established that it participates in the formation of the innate and adaptive immune response. In last years appeared data from controlled trials where there are confirmed D hypovitaminosis correlations with infections. The systemic review of the randomized controlled trials and meta analysis showed the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for reducing morbidity with respiratory diseases. In literary sources, the impact of Vitamin D is considered to influence the duration and severity of pneumonia. The authors note that in the cases of severe and complicated pneumonia, the concentrations of vitamin D was significantly lower than in control cases. It has been proposed that the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling pathway may generate beneficial effects in ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 with decreasing the cytokine/chemokine storm, regulating the renin?angiotensin system, modulating neutrophil activity. The systemic review of the randomized controlled trials and meta analysis showed the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for reducing morbidity with respiratory diseases.

Undergoing assisted reproductive treatments (ART) could generate further stress in these patients. Studies investigating the impact of anxiety on ART outcomes have shown controversial results. Moreover, there are no publications focusing on anxiety symptomsin infertile Tunisian couples. METHODS: we conducted a prospective study including 79 infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization at the Reproductive Medicine Unit of the Farhat Hached Hospital (Tunisia). Participants were asked to answer to the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) on the day of oocyte retrieval. Accordingly, they were classified into the 3 groups: group A: very low anxiety (n= 36; BAI<21), group B: moderate anxiety (n= 24; 22BAI35) and group C: severe anxiety (n=19; BAI36). For each patient, two blood samples were collected to assess free cortisol level on the day of oocyte retrieval and on the day of embryo transfer. RESULTS: results showed that women with primary infertility were significantly more stressed than those with secondary infertility (p= 0.011). Cortisol level was significantly higher on the day of embryo transfer than on the day of oocyte pick-up (p<0.0001). A lower implantation rate was found in severely anxious patients compared with moderately anxious women (p= 0.03) and those having low levels of anxiety (p= 0.001) and was negatively correlated to BAI score (r= -0.65; p= 0.001).

The aim of our study was to detect pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with severe form of COVID-19 infection using pulmonary CT angiography, and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. METHODS: From March to December 2020, we performed a prospective monocentric study collecting data from 374 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We subsequently selected patients with at least two of the following inclusion criteria: (1) severe acute respiratory symptoms (such as dyspnea, persistent cough, fever > 37.5 C, fatigue, etc.); (2) arterial oxygen saturation  93% at rest; (3) elevated D-dimer ( 500 ng/mL) and C-reactive protein levels ( 0.50 mg/dL); and (4) presence of comorbidities. A total of 63/374 (17%) patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent CT angiography during intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent (Iomeprol 400 mgI/mL). Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: About, 26/60 patients (40%) were found positive for PE at chest CT angiography. In these patients, D-dimer and CRP values were significantly higher, while a reduction in SaO2 < 93% was more common than in patients without PE (P < 0.001). Median time between illness onset and CT scan was significantly longer (15 days; P < 0.001) in patients with PE. These were more likely to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (19/26 vs. 11/34 patients; P < 0.001) and required mechanical ventilation more frequently than those without PE (15/26 patients vs. 9/34 patients; P < 0.001). Vascular enlargement was significantly more frequent in patients with PE than in those without (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Our results pointed out that patients affected by severe clinical features of COVID-19 associated with comorbidities and significant increase of D-dimer levels developed acute mono- or bi-lateral pulmonary embolism in 40% of cases. Therefore, the use of CT angiography rather than non-contrast CT should be considered in these patients, allowing a better evaluation, that can help the management and improve the outcomes.","output":"Role of CT angiography in detecting acute pulmonary embolism associated with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global health crisis since its first appearance in Wuhan, China Current epidemiological studies suggest that COVID-19 affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung diseases The differences in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are likely to be multifaceted, depending on various biological, social, and economical factors Specifically, the socioeconomic differences and psychological impact of COVID-19 affecting males and females are essential in pandemic mitigation and preparedness Previous clinical studies have shown that females are less susceptible to acquire viral infections and reduced cytokine production Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response Furthermore, in-vivo studies of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) showed higher expression in the kidneys of male than female patients, which may explain the differences in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19 between male and female patients However, it remains unknown whether the expression of ACE2 differs in the lungs of male or female patients Disparities in healthcare access and socioeconomic status between ethnic groups may influence COVID-19 rates Ethnic groups often have higher levels of medical comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status, which may increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 through weak cell-mediated immunity In this article, we examine the current literature on the gender and racial differences among COVID-19 patients and further examine the possible biological mechanisms underlying these differences","output":"Racial and Gender-Based Differences in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak disproportionally affects vulnerable populations including people who inject drugs (PWID). Social distancing and stay-at-home orders might result in a lack of access to medical and social services, poorer mental health, and financial precariousness, and thus, increases in HIV and HCV risk behaviors. This article explores how the HIV/HCV risk behaviors of PWID in Haiphong, a city with high harm reduction service coverage in Vietnam, changed during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what shaped such changes, using the risk environment framework. METHOD: We conducted three focus group discussions with peer outreach workers in May 2020 at the very end of the first lockdown, and 30 in-depth interviews with PWID between September and October 2020, after the second wave of infection in Vietnam. Discussions and interviews centered on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, and how their drug use and sexual behaviors changed as a result of the pandemic. RESULTS: The national shutdown of nonessential businesses due to the COVID-19 epidemic caused substantial economic challenges to participants, who mostly were in a precarious financial situation before the start of the epidemic. Unsafe injection is no longer an issue among our sample of PWID in Haiphong thanks to a combination of different factors, including high awareness of injection-related HIV/HCV risk and the availability of methadone treatment. However, group methamphetamine use as a means to cope with the boredom and stress related to COVID-19 was common during the lockdown. Sharing of smoking equipment was a standard practice. Female sex workers, especially those who were active heroin users, suffered most from COVID-related financial pressure and may have engaged in unsafe sex. CONCLUSION: While unsafe drug injection might no longer be an issue, group methamphetamine use and unsafe sex were the two most worrisome HIV/HCV risk behaviors of PWID in Haiphong during the social distancing and lockdown periods. These elevated risks could continue beyond the enforced lockdown periods, given PWID in general, and PWID who are also sex workers in particular, have been disproportionately affected during the global crisis.","output":"How has the COVID-19 epidemic affected the risk behaviors of people who inject drugs in a city with high harm reduction service coverage in Vietnam?

This paper has two objectives: (1) to define the Fundamental Cause Theory (FCT) and the Socioecological Model (SEM) within the context of physical therapy in order to promote best clinical practice and (2) to apply the concept of \\"fundamental interventions\\" in clinical practice to mitigate the negative impact of downstream effects of social determinants of health across levels of the SEM-individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and societal. This theoretical lens provides the conceptual framework necessary for physical therapists to think creatively about ways to change their practice in their own contexts to impact the life of individual patients and transform the movement health of society. IMPACT As health care providers, physical therapists have a responsibility to make every effort to meet the needs of their patients and optimize movement health in society; yet significant structural and systemic barriers often prevent patients from reaching their fullest potential.

Between March and September 2020, as part of the initial Everyone In government response to COVID-19 in England, 10,566 people were living in emergency accommodation and nearly 18,911 people had been moved into settled accommodation. However, some forms of temporary accommodation may not be suitable as shared facilities make it impossible for people to adhere to government guidelines to reduce the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: This is parallel group, pilot randomised controlled trial. The target is to recruit three local authorities, each of which will recruit 50 participants (thus a total of approximately 150 participants). Individuals are eligible if they are aged 18 and over, in a single-person homeless household, temporarily accommodated by the LA with recourse to public funds. Participants will be randomised to receive settled accommodation (intervention group) or temporary accommodation (control group). The intervention group includes settled housing such as Private Rented Sector (low and medium support), Social Housing (low and medium support), and Housing First (High support). The control group will maintain treatment as usual. The follow-up period will last 6 months. The primary outcome is to assess the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and acceptability of trial processes against progression criteria laid out in a traffic light system (green: all criteria are met, the trial should progress as designed in this pilot; amber: the majority of criteria are met and with adaptations to methods all criteria could be met; red: the minority of criteria are met and the pilot RCT should not proceed). Secondary outcomes include assessment of completeness of data collection at 3 and 6 months and percentage of participants consenting to data linkage, as well as a process evaluation and economic evaluation.

Seven-hundred seventeen patients from the metropolitan area of Milan in Lombardia (Italy) who had been referred for tele-monitoring after a confirmed or plausible SARS-CoV-2 infection between February and May 2020 were evaluated with a semi-structured phone interview between February and March 2021, regardless of the severity of the disease during the acute phase. In the phone interview performed by trained medical staff we looked for clinical complications in the following domains: respiratory disorders, fatigue and weakness, muscle and joint pain, movement impairments, neurological and cognitive impairments, sensory alterations, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients were asked if symptoms were present before the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if the symptom was present at the current time.Interpretation: At 12-months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were still suffering of symptoms identified at shorter follow-up including fatigue, pain and sleep disorders among the most frequent. A more severe impairment in the acute phase did not seem to predict more severe complications, further supporting the unpredictability of such consequences.

We sought to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibody (Ab) among resident and fellow physicians with varying degrees of exposure to COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study of Milwaukee-based resident and fellow physicians, encompassing December 2019-June 2020, was conducted. Relevant variables of interest were ascertained by survey and payroll data, and Abbott ARCHITECT Ab test (index cut-off of 1.4) was performed. Descriptive statistics were generated, with 95% CI calculated for the study's primary outcome of seroprevalence. Results: Among survey respondents (92 of 148, 62%), 61% were male, 44% were non-White, mean age was 31 years, 94% had no underlying conditions, and 52% were either family or internal medicine residents. During the study period, 32% reported cough, headache, or sore throat and 62% traveled outside of Wisconsin. Overall, 83% thought they had a COVID-19 exposure at work and 33% outside of work; 100% expressed any exposure.

The SGp and main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 are important targets for designing and developing antiviral compounds for new drug discovery. In this study, we selected seventeen phytochemicals and later performed molecular docking to determine the binding interactions of the compounds with the two receptors and calculated several drug-likeliness properties for each compound. Luteolin, myricetin and quercetin demonstrated higher affinity for both the proteins and interacted efficiently. To obtain compounds with better properties, we designed three analogues from these compounds and showed their greater druggable properties compared to the parent compounds.

We strongly believe that the application of ERAS protocols could play a key role during these unprecedented COVID-19 times. ABSTRACT: The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the provision of medical services for both patients that receive care for COVID-19 and for those that need care either for benign diseases, including obesity, or for malignancies, such as gynecological cancer. In this perspective article, we focus on the association among three major worldwide health issues and how ERAS protocols can potentially provide optimal management of patients with obesity and malignancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special attention to patients who required surgery for gynecologic oncology. A thorough search of the literature on the respective topics was performed. Patients with malignancy and obesity presented with increased vulnerability to COVID-19 infection. However, the management of their disease should not be withheld. Protective measures should be established to reduce exposure of patients with oncological diseases to SARS-CoV-2 while simultaneously enabling their access to vaccination. Since ERAS protocols have proved to be efficient in many surgical fields, including gynecologic oncology, general surgery, and orthopedics, we strongly believe that ERAS protocols may play a significant role in this effort. The end of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be accurately predicted. Nevertheless, we have to ensure the appropriate and efficient management of certain groups of patients.","output":"Where Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) Protocols Meet the Three Major Current Pandemics: COVID-19, Obesity and Malignancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak forced governments to make decisions that had adverse effects on local food systems and supply chains.

However, the prognostic meaning and time-line changes of lung injury assessed by LUS in COVID-19 hospitalised patients, is unknown. METHODS: Prospective cohort study designed to analyse prognostic value of LUS in COVID-19 patients by using a quantitative scale (LUZ-score) during the first 72 h after admission. Primary endpoint was in-hospital death and/or admission to the intensive care unit. Total length of hospital stay, increase of oxygen flow or escalate medical treatment during the first 72 h, were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: 130 patients were included in the final analysis; mean age was 56.713.5 years. Time since the beginning of symptoms until admission was 6 days (4C9). Lung injury assessed by LUZ-score did not differ during the first 72 h (21 points [16C26] at admission versus 20 points [16C27] at 72 h; p=0.183).

This study provides an in-depth analysis of the trends of taxa trade and factors that influence trade from 1975C2018 by combining zoonotic disease data with data from the CITES database. Trade flow showed that reptiles were the most traded group, followed by birds, mammals, and amphibians. Species of the families Pythonidae, Dendrobatidae, Cercopithecidae, and Psittacidae were the most traded.

Most exporter countries that traded with Ghana are from Africa and importers from the United States of America, Europe and Asia. Continuous trade in reptiles and birds, especially the endangered pythons and psittacus species, could lead to their extinction in the wild. The outbreak of zoonotic diseases influenced the dynamics of the wildlife trade in Ghana as traders shifted their activities among taxa over a period of time.

METHODS: We reviewed the records of 1167 patients with benign parotid tumors who were seen in our department between September 1999 and April 2021. Among them, 387 cases were WT and 668 cases were pleomorphic adenoma. We evaluated preoperative diagnoses of WT by symptoms/signs, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), imaging, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and technetium-99m pertechnetate (Tc-99m) scintigraphy. Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analyses. RESULTS: Warthin tumors were treated by surgery in 238 cases and follow-up in 149 cases. The 238 patients were diagnosed as WT at the final pathology after surgery. Among them, 172 patients (72.3%) were determined as benign histological type by preoperative FNAC; in these 172 patients, 170 (71.4%) were correctly diagnosed as WT in the final pathology. Preoperative Tc-99m scintigraphy was performed in 69 patients diagnosed with WT by final pathology or FNAC, and the positive rate of Tc-99m scintigraphy in WT was 75.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Combining FNAC and Tc-99m scintigraphy, as well as considering clinical findings, enables the diagnosis of WT in most cases. In particular, WT is more common in the elderly, grows more slowly, and is less likely to be malignant. Therefore, if WT can be diagnosed preoperatively with a high rate of correct diagnosis, it could be an accurate and effective means of managing patients through follow-up without surgery.","output":"Management for Warthin Tumor of the Parotid Gland: Surgery or Observation.

This study examines equality in the regional distribution of medical imaging devices within the scope of health expenditures. Turkey's Nomenclature of Territorial Units Level 1 regions' data have been used as a representative dataset. Regions were compared in terms of the number of medical imaging devices and imaging numbers. According to the indicator of the total number of medical imaging devices per 1 million people, the highest number of medical imaging devices was in Istanbul and least in the Middle East Anatolia Region. According to the imaging number indicators for every 1,000 examinations, it was found that the highest and lowest regions were in Istanbul and the Eastern Black Sea, respectively. The findings of this study show that there is an inequality in the regional distribution of medical imaging devices. Based on the findings, it can be argued that the main reason for this inequality is that private sector investments are concentrated in some regions. In addition, higher public health expenditure per capita in some regions can be argued as another reason.","output":"Sa?l?k Harcamalar?

We observed a high impact of both the mother's phenotype and lactation time on HM metabolome composition. Furthermore, statistically significant differences, although weak, were observed in terms of GA when comparing extremely and moderately preterm milk. Overall, our study provides new insights into preterm HM metabolome composition that may help to optimize feeding of preterm newborns, and thus improve the postnatal growth and later health outcomes of these fragile patients.","output":"NMR Metabonomic Profile of Preterm Human Milk in the First Month of Lactation: From Extreme to Moderate Prematurity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PRCIS: Face mask wearing has no significant effects on artifacts or vessel density measurements in optic nerve head and macular OCT-Angiography scans. PURPOSE: To assess the difference in area of artifacts observed in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) scans with and without face mask wear and to verify if mask wear interferes with OCT-A vessel density measurements. SUBJECTS AND CONTROLS: 64 eyes of 10 healthy subjects, 4 ocular hypertensive, 8 glaucoma suspects, and 17 glaucoma patients were included. METHODS: High density optic nerve head (ONH) and macula OCT-A scans were obtained in patients with and without surgical masks. Seven different artifacts (motion, decentration, defocus, shadow, segmentation failure, blink, and Z-offset) were quantitatively evaluated by 2 trained graders. The changes in the area (% of scan area) of artifacts, without and with mask wearing, and differences of vessel density were evaluated. RESULTS: Trends of increasing motion artifact area for the ONH scans [4.23 (-0.52, 8.98) %, P=0.08] and defocus artifact area for the macular scans [1.06 (-0.14, 2.26) %, P=0.08] were found with face mask wear. However, there were no significant differences in the mean % area of any artifacts (P>0.05 for all). Further, the estimated mean difference in vessel density in images acquired without and with masks was not significant for any type of artifact. CONCLUSION: Face mask wearing had no significant effect on area of artifacts or vessel density measurements.

Existing interventions to improve medication adherence have only been moderately effective. Habit formation theory is a promising strategy to improve adherence. The cue-reward-repetition principle posits that habits are formed by repeatedly completing an activity after the same cue and having the action rewarded every time. Over time, cues become increasingly important whereas rewards become less salient because the action becomes automatic. Leveraging the cue-reward-repetition principle could improve adherence to daily gout medications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial tests an adaptive intervention that leverages the repetition cue-reward principle. The trial will began recruitment in August 2021 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Eligible patients are adults with gout who have been prescribed a daily oral medication for gout and whose most recent uric acid is above 6 mg/dL. Participants will be randomised to one of three arms and given electronic pill bottles. In the two intervention arms, participants will select a daily activity to link to their medication-taking (cue) and a charity to which money will be donated every time they take their medication (reward). Participants in Arm 1 will receive reminder texts about their cue and their charity reward amount will be US$0.50 per day of medication taken. Arm 2 will be adaptive; participants will receive a US$0.25 per adherent-day and no reminder texts. If their adherence is <75% 6 weeks postrandomisation, their reward will increase to US$0.50 per adherent-day and they will receive reminder texts.

The negative health outcomes for the COVID-19 infection have been most severe in the frail elderly dwelling in Canadian long-term care (LTC) homes. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey of Ontario LTC Clinicians working in LTC homes in Ontario Canada was conducted to provide the clinician perspective on the preparedness and engagement of the LTC sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with the Ontario Long-Term Care Clinicians organization (OLTCC) and was distributed between March 30, 2020 to May 25, 2020. All registered members of the OLTCC and Nurse-led LTC Outreach Teams were invited to participate. The primary outcomes were: 1) the descriptive report of the screening measures implemented, communication and information received, and the preparation of the respondent's LTC home to a potential COVID-19 outbreak; and 2) the level of agreement, as reported using a five-point Likert scale), to COVID-19 preparedness statements for the respondent's LTC home was also assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54% (160/294). LTC homes implemented a wide range of important interventions (e.g. instituting established respiratory isolation protocols, active screening of new LTC admissions, increasing education on infection control processes, encouraging sick staff to take time off, etc). Ample communications pertinent to the pandemic were received from provincial LTC organizations, the government and public health officials. However, the feasibility of implementing public health recommendations, as well as the engagement of the LTC sector in pandemic planning were identified as areas of concern. Medical director status was associated with an increased knowledge of local implementation of interventions to mitigate COVID-19, as well as endorsing increased access to reliable COVID-19 information and resources to manage a potential COVID-19 outbreak in their LTC home. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the communication and implementation of recommendations in the Ontario LTC sector, despite some concerns regarding feasibility. Importantly, LTC clinician respondents clearly indicated that better engagement with LTC leaders is needed to plan a coordinated pandemic response.","output":"A cross-sectional survey assessing the preparedness of the long-term care sector to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pain is one of the most common reasons people present to the emergency centre with 7-10% of presentations being due to acute abdominal pain.

Current standard nucleic acid-based RT-PCR assays, although highly sensitive and specific, require transportation of samples to specialised laboratories, trained staff and expensive reagents. The latter are often not readily available in low- and middle-income countries and this may significantly impact on the successful disease management in these settings. Various studies have suggested a SARS-CoV-2 loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay as an alternative method to RT-PCR. METHODS: Four previously published primer pairs were used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the LAMP assay. To determine optimal conditions, different temperatures, sample input and incubation times were tested. Ninety-three extracted RNA samples from St. George's Hospital, London, 10 non-extracted nasopharyngeal swab samples from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, and 92 non-extracted samples from Queen Elisabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Malawi, which have previously been tested for SARS-Cov-2 by quantitative reverse-transcription RealTime PCR (qRT-PCR), were analysed in the LAMP assay. RESULTS: In this study we report the optimisation of an extraction-free colourimetric SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assay and demonstrated that a lower limit of detection (LOD) between 10 and 100 copies/L of SARS-CoV-2 could be readily detected by a colour change of the reaction within as little as 30 min. We further show that this assay could be quickly established in Malawi, as no expensive equipment is necessary. We tested 92 clinical samples from QECH and showed the sensitivity and specificity of the assay to be 86.7% and 98.4%, respectively. Some viral transport media, used routinely to stabilise RNA in clinical samples during transportation, caused a non-specific colour-change in the LAMP reaction and therefore we suggest collecting samples in phosphate buffered saline (which did not affect the colour) as the assay allows immediate sample analysis on-site. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 LAMP is a cheap and reliable assay that can be readily employed in RLS to improve disease monitoring and management.

RESULTS: There were 672 study participants engaged in this study and around 75.8% of health care providers who took the vaccine had injection site symptoms like pain (65.48%) and tenderness (57.89%). Most of them (60%) developed their injection site symptom within 12 hours after vaccination and the symptoms lasted for about 24C72 hours on most (63.53%) of the participants. Mild symptoms were identified among 70.98% of the study participants; tiredness and headache were the most reported symptoms with 52.08% and 50.15%, respectively. Only 6.1% of participants reported severe symptoms. CONCLUSION: As like that of other vaccines, the OxfordCAstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has some adverse effects and most side effects peaked within the first 24 hours following vaccination and usually lasted 1C3 days. Severe symptoms were uncommon, but they were found to be a major reason why vaccine recipients did not recommend it to others and did not plan to take their second dose. After receiving the COVID-19 vaccination, recipients should be advised about potential vaccine symptoms, how to handle them, and when and where to seek additional guidance if necessary.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine: Side Effects After the First Dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine Among Health Professionals in Low-Income Country: Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of insomnia in various industries and the associated demographic factors. We searched the nationwide night-shift Workers Specific Health Examination (nsWSHE) data extracted in 2015 information on factors associated with insomnia, including sex, age, and the number of workers in the workplace. The prevalence of moderate insomnia in the total industry was 4.6%. Industries with a high prevalence of insomnia included the arts, sports, and recreation-related services industry, followed by the activities of household as employers industry, financial and insurance activities industry, human health and social welfare industry, and accommodation and food services activities industry. The prevalence of insomnia was higher in women. Age was a significant factor. In general, insomnia was highest among those aged 60 years. Insomnia was highest in small-sized companies with fewer than five employees compared to large enterprises with more than 1000 employees. This study is the first to analyze the prevalence of insomnia among night-shift workers who participated in the WSHEs.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study with historical control. SETTING: Tertiary referral outpatient institute. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive services provided to patients with spinal disorders (N=1207). INTERVENTIONS: Telemedicine services included teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy, and lasted as long as usual interventions. They were delivered using free teleconference apps, caregivers were actively involved, and interviews and counseling were performed as usual. Teleconsultations included standard, but adapted, measurements and evaluations by video and from photographs and videos sent in advance according to specific tutorials. During telephysiotherapy, new sets of exercises were defined and recorded as usual. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared the number of services provided in 3 phases, including corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. During the control (30 working d) and COVID-19 surge (13d) only usual consultations and physiotherapy were provided; during the telemed phase (15d), only teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy were provided. If a reliable medical decision was not possible during teleconsultations, usual face-to-face interventions were prescribed. Continuous quality improvement questionnaires were also evaluated. RESULTS: During telemed, 325 teleconsulations and 882 telephysiotherapy sessions were provided in 15 days. We found a rapid decrease (-39%) of outpatient services from the control to the COVID-19 phase (R2=0.85), which partially recovered in the telemed phase for telephysiotherapy (from -37% to -21%; P<.05) and stabilized for teleconsultation (from -55% to -60%) interventions. Usual face-to-face interventions were required for 0.5% of patients. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was very high (2.8 out of 3). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is feasible and allows medical professionals to continue providing outpatient services with a high level of patient satisfaction. During the current pandemic, this experience can provide a viable alternative for many outpatient services while reducing the need for travel and face-to-face contact to a minimum.","output":"Feasibility and Acceptability of Telemedicine to Substitute Outpatient Rehabilitation Services in the COVID-19 Emergency in Italy: An Observational Everyday Clinical-Life Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored the perceptions of NHS employees working within a UK mental health trust in relation to the social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questioning focussed on social isolation and desire to interact with others before and since COVID-19; effects of safety measures including personal protective equipment and social distancing; and perceived influences of the pandemic on service users and social aspects of service delivery. All employees at an English NHS mental health service were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire (July-September 2020), resulting in 464 completed questionnaires. Response frequencies were summed across the total sample, and the influence of patient contact, age, and vulnerability to COVID-19 were explored using pairwise comparisons. Approximately two thirds of employees felt there had been a fundamental change in how they felt about interacting with others, and many had lost confidence in their ability to relate emotionally to others. Respondents were keen to adhere to safety guidance, but the majority believed that face masks and social distancing could have a detrimental effect on communication and rapport within the workplace. Other concerns included passing on the virus, social isolation of employees and service users, and a reduction in community services. COVID-19 safety measures may impact morale, communication, empathy, and the provision of client-centred care.

In order to alleviate the dual pressures from international climate negotiations and domestic environmental degradation, the Chinese government has pronounced it will reach its emission peak before 2030. However, through analyzing 12 scenarios, we found that it will be very difficult to meet this ambitious goal under the current widely used policies. With the trial implementation of Chinas carbon emission trading system (ETS), concerns arise over whether national ETS can accelerate the carbon peak process. In this paper, we propose a new proactive data envelopment analysis approach to investigate the impacts of national carbon ETS on carbon peak. Several important results are obtained. For example, we find that carbon ETS has a significant accelerating effect on carbon peak, which effect will advance the carbon peak by one to 2 years, and the corresponding peak values are reduced by 2.71C3 Gt. In addition, the setting of carbon price in the current Chinese pilot carbon market is found to be overly conservative. Last, our estimation on the carbon trading volume indicates that the ETS lacks vitality as the annual average carbon trading volume only represents approximately 4.3% of the total average carbon emissions. Based on these findings, several policy implications are suggested regarding the means by which China can more smoothly peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and implement national carbon ETS.","output":"Impacts of the carbon emission trading system on Chinas carbon emission peak: a new data-driven approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that a high respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications. The studys primary objective is to demonstrate that the incidence of postoperative complications is lower in an interventional group (patients monitored using a hemodynamic algorithm that incorporates the RER) than in a control group (treated according to standard practice). METHODS: We shall perform a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, superiority trial of consecutive patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery (i.e., abdominal, vascular, and orthopedic surgery). The control group will be treated according to the current guidelines on standard hemodynamic care. The interventional group will be treated according to an algorithm based on the RER. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one complication in the 7 days following surgery. The secondary outcomes will be the length of hospital stay, the total number of complications per patient, the 30-day mortality, the total intraoperative volume of fluids administered, and the Sequential [sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and laboratory data measured on postoperative days 1, 2, and 7. A total of 350 patients will be included. DISCUSSION: In the operating theater, the RER is potentially a continuously available, easy-to-read, indirect marker of tissue hypoperfusion and postoperative complications. If the RER does predict the occurrence of tissue hypoperfusion, it will help the physician to provide personalized hemodynamic management and limit the side effects associated with excessive hemodynamic optimization (volume overload, vasoconstriction, etc.).

Moreover, among other aims, it analyzes if teachers perceived negative impact of DL on life influenced WFC and negative affect. Finally, it examines differences in DL-related variables concerning gender, area of living, type of school, and teacher type. A path analysis model and MANOVAs on 587 teachers (Mage = 48.809.17) have been performed. Among the main findings, workaholism is a positive predictor of WFC, negative affect, and DL negative impact on work and life. Work engagement, instead, is a negative predictor of these variables and a positive predictor of DL perceived efficacy. However, workaholism is a stronger predictor than work engagement. Moreover, DL negative impact on life is a positive predictor of negative affect, while DL perceived efficacy for students negatively predicts it. Finally, DL negative impact on life predicts WFC. In conclusion, this study suggests that it is imperative to reduce workaholism (and increase study engagement) to improve teachers well-being and work quality during DL. Moreover, Schools Heads should implement training to help teachers to face the technical and educational issues posed by DL (especially for teachers working in kindergarten and secondary school and with children with special needs) to make them able to provide DL of good quality.

The origin of independent federal public health authority derives from laws designed to provide medical care for eighteenth-century merchant seamen, a group who traveled constantly and often had little access to care when they became ill in unfamiliar cities. Moreover, their illnesses threatened the mercantile trade that was essential to the economy of the fledging nation. The origins of what is now the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) began in 1798, when Congress established a fund to provide treatment for sick and injured merchant seamen.

RECENT FINDINGS: People living with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and present worse COVID-19-related outcomes, including mortality. They show low levels of information and of concern regarding the possibility of contagion and infection but presented substantially stable levels of psychotic symptoms and even increased subjective well being during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as well as the prolonged social isolation and the spread of misinformation, appear to be responsible in some cases for the onset of psychotic symptoms. SUMMARY: Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to avoid contagion. Particular attention should be devoted to maintaining the continuity of care, especially in frail patients. Telemedicine might represent a valid support, but face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential. The hypothesis of a direct role of viral infection on the onset of psychotic disorders is currently debated, as viral involvement of central nervous system appears to be rather infrequent in COVID-19.","output":"Schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created substantial challenges across higher education, requiring academic institutes to conduct all teaching, learning, and assessments remotely online.

A disinfection co-robot prototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly protection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a classroom scenario. In a static classroom with students sitting in a grid pattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while reducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness compared to a static filter.

For acute ischemic stroke, expert surveys have yielded MCIDs that are substantially higher than the MCIDs observed in actual expert behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice, potentially because of anchoring bias. METHODS We administered a structured, internet-based survey to a cross-section of academic stroke neurologists in the United States. Survey responses assessed demographic and clinical experience, and expert judgment of the MCID of the absolute increase needed in the proportion of patients achieving functional independence at 3 months to consider a novel, safe neuroprotective agent as clinically worthwhile. To mitigate anchoring bias, the survey response framework used a base 1000 rather than base 100 patient framework. RESULTS Survey responses were received from 122 of 333 academic stroke neurologists, there were 23% women, 72.8% had 6 years of practice experience, and neurovascular disease accounted for more than half of practice time in >70%. Responder-nonresponder and continuum of resistance tests indicated that responders were representative of the full expert population. Among respondents, the median MCID was 1.3% (interquartile range, 0.8% to >2%). CONCLUSIONS Stroke expert responses to MCID surveys are affected by anchoring and centrality bias. When survey design takes these into account, the expert-derived MCID for a safe acute ischemic stroke treatment is 1.1% to 1.5%, in accord with actual physician behavior in guideline writing and clinical practice.

Sedentary behavior was associated with LBP in office workers (OR=1.23). Moreover, excess weight (OR=1.35, 1.14-1.59) and smoking (OR=1.28, 1.03-1.60) were associated with LBP. Among children, sedentary lifestyle was a remarkable risk factor for LBP (OR=1.41, 1.24- 1.60); prolonged TV watching (OR=1.23, 1.08-1.41) and computer/mobile using and console playing time (OR=1.63, 1.36-1.95) were significant risk factors for LBP. Consumption of coffee, however, has yield conflicting results to be considered as a risk factor. Moreover, the researches on the correlation between sedentariness and high-intensity LBP are scarce and inconclusive. Conclusion: Sedentary behavior, whether in work or leisure time, associates with a moderate increase in the risk of LBP in adults, children and adolescents.","output":"Association between sedentary behavior and low back pain; A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: College students show higher prevalence of mental health issues as compared to the general population. Unfortunately, this year, students all over the world have to face, added pressure due to COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the mental health of Medical and Engineering Students. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out at different medical and engineering colleges in Bihar, Delhi and Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. 699 responses were collected and analyzed during the study period. Data was collected by email/ online platform through Google form via non- probability Sampling Technique. Mental health status was determined by using Corona virus anxiety screening (CAS), GHQ (General Health Questionnaire)-12, GAD (General Anxiety Disorder)-7 scale and PHQ (Patient Health Questionnaire)-9 scales.369 (53%) MBBS and 330 (47%) Engineering students participated in the study. RESULTS: Maximum participants in both groups did not have anxiety related to COVID-19 (MBBS (96.8%) and Engineering (95.2%). About two-third participants secured above cut off score i.e., MBBS (62.3%) and Engineering (64.8%) in GHQ-12. Approximately comparable proportion in both groups were found to have severe anxiety and depression (16% vs 20%), when applied GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Uncertainty in the timing of the exams/ Academic delay was found to be the most worrying factor (MBBS, 41.19% vs Engineering 31.82%). CONCLUSIONS: About two-thirds of medical and engineering students psychologically equally affected by current pandemic in our study.

This also appears to hold for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Evidence from China and Europe has suggested that mortality from COVID-19 infection is higher in men than women, but evidence from US populations is lacking. Utilizing data from a large healthcare provider, we determined if males, as compared to females have a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and if among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, male sex is independently associated with COVID-19 severity and poor in-hospital outcomes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Data were extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMR). A total of 96,473 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens via Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were included. For hospital-based analyses, all patients admitted during the same time-period were included. Of the 96,473 patients tested, 14,992 (15.6%) tested positive, of whom 4,785 (31.9%) were hospitalized and 452 (9.5%) died. Among all patients tested, men were significantly older. The overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity among all tested individuals was 15.5%, and was higher in males as compared to females 17.0% vs. 14.6% [OR 1.20]. This sex difference held after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, insurance type, median income, BMI, smoking and 17 comorbidities included in Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [aOR 1.39]. A higher proportion of males (vs. females) experienced pulmonary (ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure) and extra-pulmonary (acute renal injury) complications during their hospital course. After adjustment, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in males as compared to females. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of a large US cohort, males were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients, males were more likely to have complications, require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and had higher mortality than females, independent of age. Sex disparities in COVID-19 vulnerability are present, and emphasize the importance of examining sex-disaggregated data to improve our understanding of the biological processes involved to potentially tailor treatment and risk stratify patients.","output":"Sex differences in susceptibility, severity, and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019: Cross-sectional analysis from a diverse US metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) is characterized by patient-reported symptoms following treatment for B. burgdorferi infection.

In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PCV2-ORF2 capsid protein were generated, biologically characterized, and subsequently used to map the antigenic sites of PCV2 capsid protein by using infectious PCV DNA clones containing PCV1/PCV2-ORF2 chimeras. The PCV1/PCV2-ORF2 chimeras were constructed by serial deletions of PCV2-ORF2 and replacement with the corresponding sequences of the PCV1-ORF2. The reactivities of chimeric PCV1/PCV2 clones in transfected PK-15 cells with the seven MAbs were detected by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The chimera (r140) with a deletion of 47 amino acids at the N terminus of PCV2-ORF2 reacted strongly to all seven MAbs.

Our argument is that legislative protections based on common principles are needed for all types of COVID surveillance. Our starting point is that emergency measures pose risks requiring emergency-quality protections. Unfortunately, emergencies tend to reduce normal legislative oversight. We consider two desirable principles which are often difficult to deliver if maximum effectiveness against COVID is sought: no compulsion (voluntary);and no central database. We use three points of comparison to illustrate the legislative protections needed (and in some cases, absent):1. Australias bluetooth proximity tracing app (COVIDSafe Act)2. Australian QR Codes for attendance check-ins (no model law)3. EUs COVID status certificates (EU Digital Covid Certificate Regulations)We argue for 10 common principles which can and should be implemented in legislation applying to all types of COVID surveillance systems:1. Put controls within the countrys data privacy law2. Guarantee access to avoid discrimination3. Minimise & define authorised uses of COVID data4. Minimise data collection5. Anti-coercion provisions6. Prevent surveillance creep 7. Continuous deletion program (if data is collected)8. Sunset clause for whole system9. Supervision by independent DPA10. Transparency These 10 principles are applicable even where COVID surveillance systems are developed which are compulsory and involve centralised databases.

Full-length genome characterization of DCH revealed the genetic diversity between the nine Thai DCH sequences obtained, and that they phylogenetically formed three distinct monophyletic clades. A putative DCH recombinant strain was found, suggesting a possible role of recombination in DCH evolution. Additionally, quantitative PCR was used to determine the viral copy number in various organs of the DCH-moribund cats, while the pathological findings were compared to the viral localization in hepatocytes, adjacent to areas of hepatic fibrosis, by immunohistochemical (IHC) and western blot analysis. In addition to the liver, positive-DCH immunoreactivity was found in various other organs, including kidneys, lung, heart, intestine, brain, and lymph nodes, providing evidence of systemic infection. Ultrastructure of infected cells revealed electron-dense particles in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hepatocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.

Mounting studies specified that manifestly endless coronavirus-related newsfeeds and death numbers considerably increased the risk of global mental health issues. Social media provided positive and negative data, and the COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide infodemic. It has eroded public trust and impeded virus restraint, which outlived the coronavirus pandemic itself. METHODS: The study incorporated the narrative review analysis based on the existing literature related to mental health problems using the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) approach to minimize the COVID-19 adverse consequences on global mental health. The study performed a search of the electronic databases available at PsycINFO, PubMed, and LISTA. This research incorporates the statistical data related to the COVID-19 provided by the WHO, John Hopkins University, and Pakistani Ministry of Health. RESULTS: Pakistan reported the second-highest COVID-19 cases within South Asia, the fifth-highest number of cases in Asia after Iran, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the 14th highest recorded cases, as of October 14, 2020.

Repair, on the other hand, allows restoring the function of an existing but failing organ. The recognition that human lungs can both repair and regenerate is quite novel, the concept has not been widely used to treat patients. We present evidence that the human adult lung does repair and regenerate and introduce different ways to harness this power. Various types of lung stem cells are capable of proliferating and differentiating upon injury driving the repair/regeneration process. Injury models, primarily in mice, combined with lineage tracing studies, have allowed the identification of these important cells. Some of these cells, such as basal cells, broncho-alveolar stem cells, and alveolar type 2 cells, rely on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling for their survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. While preclinical studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of FGFs, a recent clinical trial for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using intravenous injection of FGF7 did not report the expected beneficial effects. We discuss the potential reasons for these negative results and propose the rationale for new approaches for future clinical trials, such as delivery of FGFs to the damaged lungs through efficient inhalation systems, which may be more promising than systemic exposure to FGFs. While this change in the administration route presents a challenge, the therapeutic promises displayed by FGFs are worth the effort.","output":"Evidence for lung repair and regeneration in humans: key stem cells and therapeutic functions of fibroblast growth factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, the second pandemic of the twenty-first century.

A secondary objective was to correlate Doppler ultrasound findings with those from direct measurement of renal blood flow (RBF). METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in hemodynamically stable Maryland piglets with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) and in hemodynamically unstable critically ill children requiring CKRT. Doppler-based RRI and PI were assessed for each subject. Measurements were made by two different operators (pediatric intensivists) before and after CKRT onset. RESULTS: Observer variability assessment in the measurement of RRI and PI rendered a moderate correlation for both RRI (ICC 0.65, IQR 0.51-0.76) and PI (ICC 0.63, IQR 0.47-0.75). RRI and PI showed no correlation with RBF or urine output. Baseline RRI and PI were normal in control piglets [RRI 0.68 (SD 0.02), PI 1.25 (SD 0.09)] and those with AKI [RRI 0.68 (SD 0.03), PI 1.20 (SD 0.13)]. Baseline RRI and PI were elevated in critically ill children (RRI 0.85, PI 2.0). PI and RRI did not change with CKRT in any study group. CONCLUSIONS: Observer variability between inexperienced pediatric intensivists was comparable with that between senior and junior operators. Doppler-based calculations did not correlate with invasive measurements of RBF. RRI and PI were normal in hemodynamically stable piglets with and without AKI. RRI and PI were high in hemodynamically unstable patients requiring CKRT. RRI and PI did not change after CKRT onset, despite changes in hemodynamic status.

The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Drug repurposing screen identifies masitinib as a 3CLpro inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation and recognized as the most prevalent chronic illness among children.

Its use in the perioperative setting for patients with metastatic disease has not been well studied. We characterize perioperative plasma ctDNA and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 71 patients undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases and evaluated their plasma with a targeted 73-gene ctDNA next-generation sequencing test before and after surgery. The association between perioperative ctDNA, as well as other patient factors, and PFS was evaluated by Cox regression. RESULTS ctDNA was detectable in 28 patients (39.4%) preoperatively and in 37 patients (52.1%) postoperatively. Patients with high ctDNA [maximum somatic variant allele fraction (MSVAF) > 0.25%] had worse PFS than those with low MSVAF (< 0.25%) in both the pre- and postoperative settings (median 4.8 vs. 19.3 months, p < 0.001, and 9.2 vs.15.0 months, p = 0.049, respectively; log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, high-grade histology [hazard ratio (HR) 3.42, p = 0.001], incomplete resection (HR 2.35, p = 0.010), and high preoperative MSVAF (HR 3.04, p = 0.001) were associated with worse PFS. Patients with new postoperative alterations in the context of preoperative alteration(s) also had a significantly shorter PFS compared with other groups (HR 4.28, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS High levels of perioperative ctDNA and new postoperative ctDNA alterations in the context of preoperative alterations predict worse outcomes in patients undergoing resection for peritoneal metastases.

Methods Stakeholders of respective centers for advanced trauma training deliberated over safe means to resume ATLS and ATCN. Meticulous screening of all participants and pre- and post-course tracking were deemed the most important components for the safe resumption of courses. 'Paperless' course, 'open-air' skill stations, 'payment protection', 'buddy system', point of care sanitizer installation, packed food, and potable beverages were major organizational changes. Participants above 60 years and with uncontrolled comorbidities were not enrolled. Results Two ATCN, one ATLS (civilian), and one combined ATLS-ATCN (military) were conducted. 78 delegates trained by 32 faculties and 13 personnel. All underwent daily thermal scanning and smartphone application-based COVID-19 tracking.

Reporter activity could be readily quantified in infected cultures, but the virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was more stable than viruses bearing fluorescent proteins and was therefore analyzed in detail. Quantification of Gaussia luciferase activity in the supernatants of infected culture allowed the convenient and highly sensitive detection of viral spread, and enzymatic activity correlated with the number of infectious particles released from infected cells. Furthermore, the Gaussia luciferase encoding virus allowed the sensitive quantification of the antiviral activity of the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) zanamivir and the host cell interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1C3, which are known to inhibit influenza virus entry.

Previous studies have shown that vascular growth is impaired in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Objective: The goal of this study was to examine tracheal (T-VEGF) and gastric (G-VEGF) levels in premature infants in the first and third day of life and examine if these levels were associated with the development of BPD.Design/methods: Tracheal aspirates from intubated infants and gastric samples from others were obtained on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 3 (D3) from 43 preterm infants (<2000 g birth weight, 34 wks gestation). VEGF was quantified by a VEGF Elisa Kit. Demographic, clinical, and pulmonary outcome data were collected including information on respiratory support (oxygenation index (OI) and ventilatory index (VI)) and on the development of BPD, determined at 36 weeks PMA using NICHD criteria.Results: The mean birth weight was 1060  379 g and gestational age 27.5  2.8 wks. BPD was diagnosed in 26 infants who were less mature than the 17 controls without BPD. Day 1 and day 3T-VEGF concentrations did not correlate, but day 3 levels correlated with gestational age (r = 0.75, p < .05). BPD infants, characterized by longer ventilator, CPAP and oxygen days, had day 1T-VEGF levels similar to control infants (126.6  194.7 vs. 149.7  333.2 pg/ml) but day 3 levels were significantly lower (168.9  218.8 vs. 1041.6  676.7 pg/ml). Day 1G-VEGF levels reflected tracheal samples, trending lower in BPD infants. Mode of delivery, race, sex, antenatal steroid administration, chorioamnionitis, sepsis, or growth restriction did not impact VEGF levels. However, lower VEGF levels were associated with a lower VI and lower OI: Day 3 OI correlated with day 3T-VEGF (r = 0.72, p > .05), albeit not significantly. T-VEGF increased from day 1 to day 3 in controls and decreased in BPD infants. There was no relationship between oxygen, CPAP and ventilator days and day 1 or day 3T-VEGF levels.Conclusions: BPD may be associated with low-serum VEGF levels during the first week of life.

RESULTS: Most patients preferred and perceived decision making as shared (SDM; 58% and 43%, respectively), followed by paternalistic (26% and 38%), and informative (16% and 15%). A large minority (n = 103, 21%) of patients preferring shared or informative decision making (n = 482) experienced paternalistic decision making. Mean (SD) OPTION5 scores were highest in consultations which patients perceived as informative (26.0 (19.7)), followed by shared (19.1 (17.2)) and lowest in paternalistic decision making (11.8 (13.4) p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients want to be involved in decision making. Patients perceive that the physician makes the decision more often than they prefer, and perceive more involvement in the decision than objective assessment by an independent researcher shows. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A clearer understanding of patients' medical decision-making experiences is needed to optimize physician SDM training programmes and patient awareness campaigns.","output":"Patients' preferred and perceived decision-making roles, and observed patient involvement in videotaped encounters with medical specialists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus has emerged as a global health threat due to its accelerated geographic spread over the last two decades. This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Historically, it has caused two pandemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome followed by the present COVID-19 that emerged from China. The virus is believed to be acquired from zoonotic source and spreads through direct and contact transmission. The symptomatic phase manifests with fever, cough and myalgia to severe respiratory failure. The diagnosis is confirmed using reverse transcriptase PCR. Management of COVID-19 is mainly by supportive therapy along with mechanical ventilation in severe cases. Preventive strategies form the major role in reducing the public spread of virus along with successful disease isolation and community containment. Development of a vaccine to eliminate the virus from the host still remains an ongoing challenge.","output":"Origin, transmission, diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted clinical research due to safety measures such as social distancing and lockdowns. However, developing treatments for COVID-19 relies on conducting clinical trials. Using telemedicine or virtual methods may support ongoing trials and limit the pandemic's impact on clinical research. OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of virtual methods among ongoing and discontinued COVID-19 clinical trials. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional analysis, we performed a systematic search of ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 related trials registered since the pandemic began. In masked, duplicate fashion, authors extracted data from included studies, noting whether trialists reported using telecommunication, virtualization, or remote data collection to deliver interventions and monitor outcome measures. The authors also coded the use of virtual methods for recruitment, enrollment, or follow-up visits. Chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess differences in the use of virtual methods between ongoing and discontinued studies and differences between intervention types. RESULTS: Our search returned 2549 clinical trials, of which 2383 were included. Of included studies, 2109 (88.5%) were ongoing and 274 (11.5%) were discontinued. Overall, 519 (24.6%) ongoing COVID-19 trials reported using virtual methods for trial conduct and 43 (15.7%) discontinued trials reported using virtual methods. There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of reporting virtual methods between discontinued and ongoing trials (X(2)(1) = 27.2, P < .001). Studies listed as Behavioral or Other were more likely to report using virtual methods for delivering interventions compared to other intervention types (X(2)(1) = 751.88, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented need for safe and efficient clinical trial conduct. Nearly a quarter of ongoing COVID-19 clinical trials in our sample reported using virtual methods for supporting trial progress. Ongoing trials were more likely to report virtual methods compared to discontinued trials. Developing strategies that allow for continuing trials during emergencies may limit trial disruption. Exploring and developing remote trial methods may continue to be valuable in light of emerging COVID-19 variants and may persist beyond the pandemic.","output":"The use of telecommunication and virtualization among ongoing and discontinued COVID-19 clinical trials: A cross-sectional analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper argues that this animal surveillance has the potential for considerable function creep going far outside the scheme's original objectives and acts as a conduit for more problematic surveillance of humans This results in social sorting of people with subsequent unforeseen consequences leading to discrimination and curtailment of freedoms for both animals and their owners Ultimately this opens people up to further intrusive targeting by commercial interests and, more alarmingly, scrutiny from law enforcement agencies Design/methodology/approachAn empirical study examining an initiative involving the collection of canine DNA sources data from publicly available Cabinet, Select Committee and Scrutiny Committee records from the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham (LBBD) It also draws on news media sources, publicity material from the company running the scheme and from this and other local authorities Methods include analysis of documents, semiotic and discourse analysis FindingsThis paper highlights the importance of animals to surveillance studies and examines the extent to which animals are a part of the surveillant assemblage in their own right It also demonstrates how nonhuman animals extend the reach of the surveillant assemblage Social implicationsThe scheme was called a badge of considerate dog ownership, yet it is one that can be franchised to tie up with diverse income streams being described as advantageous in the age of austerity In 2017, it was reported that this scheme was to be rolled out in other areas and was moving from being voluntary to being mandatory with the enforcement of Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) These have been described as geographically defined ASBOS that have come into force under the Anti-social Behaviour and Policing Act (2014);they often work to criminalise activities that were not previously considered illegal Originality/valueIn the theorising of surveillance, animals have been largely overlooked Epidemiological studies proliferate, yet the role of animals in many aspects of everyday surveillance has been neglected","output":"No shit Sherlock!

Methods: We therefore performed a comprehensive comparative study, analyzing RNA-Seq data of infections with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including data from different types of cells as well as COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses. Results and Conclusion: First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TMPRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2.

The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works related to the new pathogen have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is challenging. In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for investigating: (1) which tools and frameworks are mostly used for early scholarly communication; (2) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e. quasi-zero-day) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. Additionally, correlation coefficients are not inflated by indicators associated with zero values, which are quite common at very early stages after an article has been published. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Then, we define a method, i.e. the Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS), that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator. CIS shows promising results as a tool for selecting relevant papers even in a tight time-window. Our results foster the development of automated frameworks aimed at helping the scientific community in identifying relevant work even in case of limited literature and observation time.","output":"Using altmetrics for detecting impactful research in quasi-zero-day time-windows: the case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparotomy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI), but is often unhelpful or too late due to non-specific clinical and radiological signs.

Few studies combining parasitology and entomology have been conducted despite the need for accurate information to design effective vector control measures. In a Malagasy region of moderate to intense transmission of both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, parasitology and entomology have been combined to survey malaria transmission in two nearby villages. METHODS: Community-based surveys were conducted in the villages of Ambohitromby and Miarinarivo at three time points (T1, T2 and T3) during a single malaria transmission season. Human malaria prevalence was determined by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy and real-time PCR. Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches and pyrethrum spray catches and the presence of Plasmodium sporozoites was assessed by TaqMan assay. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence was not significantly different between villages, with an average of 8.0% by RDT, 4.8% by microscopy and 11.9% by PCR. This was mainly due to P. falciparum and to a lesser extent to P. vivax. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence rate as determined by PCR at T2 ([Formula: see text] = 7.46, P = 0.025). Likewise, mosquitoes were significantly more abundant at T2 ([Formula: see text] = 64.8, P < 0.001), especially in Ambohitromby. At T1 and T3 mosquito abundance was higher in Miarinarivo than in Ambohitromby ([Formula: see text] = 14.92, P < 0.001). Of 1550 Anopheles mosquitoes tested, 28 (1.8%) were found carrying Plasmodium sporozoites. The entomological inoculation rate revealed that Anopheles coustani played a major contribution in malaria transmission in Miarinarivo, being responsible of 61.2 infective bites per human (ib/h) during the whole six months of the survey, whereas, it was An. arabiensis, with 36 ib/h, that played that role in Ambohitromby. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a similar malaria prevalence in two nearby villages, the entomological survey showed a different contribution of An. coustani and An. arabiensis to malaria transmission in each village. Importantly, the suspected secondary malaria vector An. coustani, was found playing the major role in malaria transmission in one village. This highlights the importance of combining parasitology and entomology surveys for better targeting local malaria vectors. Such study should contribute to the malaria pre-elimination goal established under the 2018C2022 National Malaria Strategic Plan.

OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) images of 12 * 12 mm centered on the foveal of each eye were analyzed. Three-dimensional choroidal vascularity index (CVI), choroidal thickness, and choriocapillaris density were compared among BRVO eyes, fellow eyes, and healthy control eyes. En face CVI maps in BRVO eyes were generated to analyze the dilatation pattern of choroidal vessels. Results: CVI values in a few 1 * 1 mm grids in the non-affected hemi side were higher in BRVO eyes compared with the fellow eyes and control eyes (p < 0.05). Choriocapillaris density decreased in both BRVO eyes and fellow eyes compared with normal eyes while choriocapillaris density was higher in a few grids in the non-affected hemi side in BRVO eyes compared with fellow eyes (p < 0.05).

The ideal cell system for a diagnostic virology laboratory would be a continuous line which retained its diploid chromosome number. It would be impossible in a routine laboratory to inoculate each specimen into every type of cell culture. A routine procedure is therefore employed and the specimen is inoculated into three types of cells which will support the growth of as many viruses as possible. Mixed culture technique (cocultivation) has proved of value when a viral agent is difficult to isolate from the original tissue, for example, isolation of measles from a brain biopsy. Cultures of chopped tissues have been used for many years to support the growth of viruses but the techniques were not readily applicable to diagnostic virology.

OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of using Tanner stages as a method for esti mating chronological age in alleged child pornography cases based on published evidence. MATERIAL AND METHOD Systematic review study in PubMed and Scopus databases following PRISMA guideli nes. Articles describing the outcome of using Tanner stages to estimate chronological age in alleged child pornography cases were identified. For screening, those written in English or Spanish published from January 1, 2000, to April 30, 2020, were considered. The following data were extracted from the articles included: type of study; material and methods used; Tanner items examined; evaluators' characteristics; results; estimated chronological age versus real age; observer-dependent variations (bias); and conclusions. RESULTS Seven studies were included. Three were literature reviews and four were case studies with expert testimony and observer bias. This method is ineffective when the alleged victim, in both sexes, shows sexual maturation in Tanner stages 3-5. In stages 1-2, it may be useful to state that the victim is under 18 years old, but not to determine their chronological age.

Anxiety and depression are among the most common psychological difficulties. The aim of this study is to evaluate an optimized version of a promising indicated group intervention for emotional problems. The program (EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targets school children 8C12 years with anxious and depressive symptoms and examines three factors. Factor 1 compares the standard EMOTION intervention delivered in 16 group-based sessions (Group), versus a partially-digital EMOTION intervention (DIGGI) delivered as eight group sessions and eight digital sessions. Both versions use virtual reality technology (VR) to improve behavioral experiments. Factor 2 compares parent participation in a 5-session parent group (high involvement) versus sharing information with parents via a brochure (low involvement). Factor 3 compares the use of a measurement and feedback system (MFS) designed to help group leaders tailor the intervention using feedback from children with no MFS. METHODS: Using a cluster-randomized factorial design, 40 schools across Norway will be randomized to eight different experimental conditions based on three, two-level factors. To assess internalizing symptoms in children, children and their parents will be given self-report questionnaires pre-, post-, and one year after intervention. Parents also report on demographics, user satisfaction, personal symptoms and perception of family related factors. Teachers report on child symptoms and school functioning. Group leaders and the head of the municipal services report on implementation issues. The primary outcomes are changes in depressive and anxious symptoms. Some secondary outcomes are changes in self-esteem, quality of life, and user satisfaction. Questions regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are included. Treatment fidelity is based on checklists from group leaders, and on user data from the participating children. DISCUSSION: This study is a collaboration between three regional centers for child and adolescent mental health in Norway. It will provide knowledge about: (1) the effect of school-based preventive interventions on anxiety and depression in children; (2) the effect of feedback informed health systems, (3) the effect and cost of digital health interventions for children, and (4) the effect of parental involvement.

With graphs growing in size, node classification on large graphs can be space and time consuming, even with powerful classifiers such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Hence, some questions are raised, particularly, whether one can keep only some of the edges of a graph while maintaining prediction performance for node classification, or train classifiers on specific subgraphs instead of a whole graph with limited performance loss in node classification. To address these questions, we propose Sparsified Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN), a neural network graph sparsifier that sparsifies a graph by pruning some edges. We formulate sparsification as an optimization problem, which we solve by an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based solution. We show that sparsified graphs provided by SGCN can be used as inputs to GCN, leading to better or comparable node classification performance with that of original graphs in GCN, DeepWalk, and GraphSAGE.","output":"SGCN: A Graph Sparsifier Based on Graph Convolutional Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An online questionnaire survey was used to assess the application of noninvasive strategies in the management of COVID-19 patients.

A computer-assisted analysis of the two now complete sets of these sequences of strain IBV-M42 and MHV-A59 shows that, in contrast to the previous theory, differences amongst stabilities of intermolecular base-pairings between the leader and the intergenic regions are not sufficient to determine the mRNA gradients in both MHV and IBV infected cells. Neither can the accessibility of the interacting regions on the leader and the negative stranded genome, as revealed by secondary structure analysis, explain the mRNA levels. The nested gene organisation itself, on the other hand, could be responsible for observed mRNA levels gradually increasing with gene order. Relatively slow new initiation events at intergenic regions are proposed to block elongation of passing transcripts which, via temporary pausing, can cause premature termination of transcription.

Early diagnosis of infected individuals will play an important role in stopping its further escalation. The present gold standard for sampling is the nasopharyngeal swab method. However, several recent papers suggested that saliva-based testing is a promising alternative that could simplify and accelerate COVID-19 diagnosis. Objectives: Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the reliability and consistency of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in saliva specimens. Methods: We have reported our meta-analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook. We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science and clinical trial registries for eligible studies published between 1 January and 25 April 2020. The number of positive tests and the total number of tests conducted were collected as raw data. The proportion of positive tests in the pooled data were calculated by score confidence-interval estimation with the FreemanCTukey transformation. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) measure and the (2)-test. Results: The systematic search revealed 96 records after removal of duplicates. Twenty-six records were included for qualitative analysis and 5 records for quantitative synthesis. We found 91% (CI 80C99%) sensitivity for saliva tests and 98% (CI 89C100%) sensitivity for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) tests in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients, with moderate heterogeneity among the studies. Additionally, we identified 18 registered, ongoing clinical trials of saliva-based tests for detection of the virus.

PURPOSE: To update a previous review of remdesivir for adults with COVID-19, including new meta-analyses of patients with COVID-19 of any severity compared with control. DATA SOURCES: Several sources from 1 January 2020 through 7 December 2020. STUDY SELECTION: English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir for COVID-19. New evidence is incorporated by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: 1 reviewer abstracted data; a second reviewer verified the data. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method were used. DATA SYNTHESIS: The update includes 5 RCTs, incorporating data from a new large RCT and the final results of a previous RCT. Compared with control, a 10-day course of remdesivir probably results in little to no reduction in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.06]; 4 RCTs) but may result in a small reduction in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.56 to 0.90]; 3 RCTs). Remdesivir probably results in a moderate increase in the percentage of patients who recovered and a moderate decrease in serious adverse events and may result in a large reduction in time to recovery. Effect on hospital length of stay or percentage remaining hospitalized is mixed. Compared with a 10-day course for those not requiring ventilation at baseline, a 5-day course may reduce mortality, the need for ventilation, and serious adverse events while increasing the percentage of patients who recovered or clinically improved. LIMITATION: Summarizing findings was challenging because of varying disease severity definitions and outcomes. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, remdesivir probably results in little to no mortality difference but probably improves the percentage recovered and reduces serious harms and may result in a small reduction in the proportion receiving ventilation. For patients not receiving ventilation, a 5-day course may provide greater benefits and fewer harms with lower drug costs than a 10-day course.

However, information about the effect of cryopreservation on outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic donor grafts is limited. We evaluated outcomes of HCT recipients who received either fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 7397 patients were included in the analysis. Recipients of cryopreserved graft were divided into 3 cohorts based on graft source: HLA-matched related PBSC donors (na?=a?1051), matched unrelated PBSC donors (na?=a?678), and matched related or unrelated BM donors (na?=a?154). These patients were propensity score matched with 5514 patients who received fresh allografts. The primary endpoint was engraftment. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increased risk of delayed engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival with cryopreservation of BM grafts. In contrast, cryopreservation of related donor PBSC grafts was associated with decreased platelet recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.78; P < .001) and an increased risk of grade II-IV (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.48; Pa?=a?.002) and grade III-IV (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.84; P < .001) acute graft-versus-host disease. Cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC grafts was associated with delayed engraftment of neutrophils (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and platelets (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.66; P < .001) as well as an increased risk of NRM (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.66; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58; Pa?=a?.002) and decreased progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.58; P < .001). Reasons for cryopreservation were not routinely collected; however, in a subset of unrelated donor HCT recipients, the reason was typically a change in patient condition. Products cryopreserved for patient reasons were significantly associated with inferior OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; Pa?=a?.029). We conclude that cryopreservation is associated with slower engraftment of PBSC grafts, which may be associated with inferior transplantation outcomes in some patient populations. However, the small numbers in the cryopreserved BM cohort and the lack of information on the reason for cryopreservation in all patients suggests that these data should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the context of the risks associated with unexpected loss of a graft during the pandemic.

After infection with SARS-CoV, the acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function. A dysregulation in this wound healing process leads to fibrosis. Many survivors of SARS-CoV infection develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), with higher prevalence in older patients. Using mouse models of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, we have identified that the wound repair pathway, controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is critical to recovery from SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage. In mice with constitutively active EGFR [EGFR(DSK5) mice], we find that SARS-CoV infection causes enhanced lung disease. Importantly, we show that during infection, the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) are upregulated, and exogenous addition of these ligands during infection leads to enhanced lung disease and altered wound healing dynamics. Our data demonstrate a key role of EGFR in the host response to SARS-CoV and how it may be implicated in lung disease induced by other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses.IMPORTANCE PF has many causative triggers, including severe respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV. Currently there are no treatments to prevent the onset or limit the progression of PF, and the molecular pathways underlying the development of PF are not well understood.

One missense variant in ACE2 (X:14,077,550; Asp30Gly), common in Ch. sabaeus, causes a change in amino acid residue that has been inferred to reduce binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility. The remaining populations appear as susceptible as humans, based on these criteria for receptor usage. All missense variants observed in wild Ch. sabaeus populations are also present in the VRC, along with two splice acceptor variants (at X:14,065,076) not observed in the wild sample that are potentially disruptive to ACE2 function. The presence of these variants in the VRC suggests a promising model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine and therapy development. In keeping with a One Health approach, characterizing actual susceptibility and potential for bi-directional zoonotic/anthroponotic transfer in savanna monkey populations may be an important consideration for controlling COVID-19 epidemics in communities with frequent human/non-human primate interactions that, in many cases, may have limited health infrastructure.","output":"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variation in savanna monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.): Potential risk for zoonotic/anthroponotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and a potential model for functional studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have potential to impact transmission of other respiratory viruses.

We provide a review of a range of epidemic models and explain the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the art of coupling between epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. More specifically, we provide answers to fundamental questions in human decision-making amid epidemics, including what interventions to take to combat the disease, who are decision-makers, and when and how to take interventions, and how to make interventions. Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become increasingly crucial in modeling human responses or behavior amid epidemics in the last decade. In this review, we motivate the game-theoretic approach to human decision-making amid epidemics. This review provides an overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which categorizes existing literature based on multiple dimensions, including (1) types of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games; (2) types of interventions, such as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, and taking antidotes; (3) the types of decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid epidemics. We showcase three representative frameworks with unique ways of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models from a vast body of literature. Each of the three frameworks has their unique way of modeling and analyzing and develops results from different angles.

SETTING: Nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital payment and cost data. DESIGN: Retrospective review and economic impact analysis. METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges that were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and also stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1,230,992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2,350 million USD, with a total hospital payment of 3,624-3,786 million USD. This led to an estimated net income of 1,278-1,440 million USD overall to U.S. hospitals in the NASS dataset from elective ophthalmic surgery (approximately 107-120 million USD per month), with a larger proportion performed in teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The cessation of elective ophthalmic surgeries at HOPDs during COVID-19 resulted in a significant loss of income for hospitals in the U.S. as well as teaching experiences for trainees at academic medical centers.","output":"Impact of reduced elective ophthalmic surgical volume on U.S. hospitals during the early coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The article analyses the global public goods approach to COVID-19 technologies, embedded in 2020 affirmations by the World Health Assembly (WHA), the UN Human Rights Council and G20 on broad immunization against COVID-19 After identifying the access to COVID-19 tools (ACT) Accelerator members, the UN efforts are identified, focusing primarily on the UN human rights bodies, acknowledging how these and the WHA have mutually reinforced each others' efforts The article finds that the global public goods terminology appeared in UN resolutions in 2020, while wording that included vaccines?on an equal footing as medicines?appeared in 2016, and recognition of generic medicines appeared in 2019 The so-called Trilateral Cooperation on IP and public health between two UN specialized agencies and the World Trade Organization (WTO) has increased awareness of the flexibilities within WTO's TRIPS Agreement These flexibilities are explained With notable exceptions, like India, these flexibilities are not widely applied in domestic legislation A different emphasis characterizes the millennium development goals era as compared to the sustainable development goals era, and this shift is explained by applying relevant theories Among pro-TRIPS developed countries there is an acknowledgment of obstacles created by the IP system, but their overall position has not changed","output":"Does TRIPS (agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) prevent COVID-19 vaccines as a global public good?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, 414,179 cases of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported.

Employment and educational outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined in a well-defined cohort of patients receiving care in an early psychosis clinic. METHODS: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 128 patients receiving care at McLean Hospital's first-episode psychosis (FEP) clinic between January 1 and September 21 in 2019 and 2020. Using a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and robust standard errors, the authors compared the average changes in the weekly employment and education proportions before and after COVID-19 lockdowns with the same changes in 2019. RESULTS: Employment losses among patients with FEP were greater than among the general population and persisted through the end of follow-up. In 2020, average employment after a stay-at-home order was instituted was 33% lower than before the order compared with the change in employment during the same period in 2019. The effect was stronger among men and those who identified as non-White, were age <21 years, or did not have a college education. Although educational engagement recovered in the fall of 2020, it still remained below the 2019 levels.

Materials and Methods: Study participants were 86 children between 8 and 17 years of age (mean age, 11.7 years; 70 boys, 16 girls; mean intellectual quotient, 83.6). QOL was evaluated using the self-assessment KINDL(R). Participants answered questions regarding depression and anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS) for temporary mood. Their parents answered questionnaires regarding their maladaptive behaviors and differences in sleep patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The student's t-test was performed to examine the presence or absence of sleep changes in the children, which affected QOL, temporary mood, and maladaptive behaviors. Multiple or simple linear regression analyses were also performed to identify the psychogenic factors that significantly affected decreased QOL for each group with and without changes in sleep schedule. Results: During the COVID-19 stay-at-home period, 46.5% of participants experienced changes in sleep patterns. These changes were associated with decreased QOL as well as internalized symptoms. The decreased QOL of children with sleep patterns changed was predicted by a high level of depression. In addition, low QOL in children with unchanged sleep patterns was predicted by a high level of depression and low current mood status. Conclusions: Almost half of the participants experienced a poor sleep schedule during the stay-at-home period. These alterations in sleep patterns were associated with a low QOL. The QOL of children with a stable life schedule was affected not only by depressive tendencies but also temporary moods. Therefore, they need to live a fulfilling life to maintain their QOL. However, the QOL of children with poor sleep patterns was affected only by depressive tendencies.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.

Studies on VSV assembly led to the creation of a recombinant VSV in which the glycoprotein (G) gene was deleted. This recombinant (rVSV-G) has been used to produce VSV pseudotypes containing the envelope glycoproteins of heterologous viruses, including viruses that require high-level biocontainment; however, because the infectivity of rVSV-G pseudotypes is restricted to a single round of replication the analysis can be performed using biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment. As such, rVSV-G pseudotypes have facilitated the analysis of virus entry for numerous viral pathogens without the need for specialized containment facilities. The pseudotypes also provide a robust platform to screen libraries for entry inhibitors and to evaluate the neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination. This manuscript describes methods to produce and titer rVSV-G pseudotypes. Procedures to generate rVSV-G stocks and to quantify virus infectivity are also described. These protocols should allow any laboratory knowledgeable in general virological and cell culture techniques to produce successfully replication-restricted rVSV-G pseudotypes for subsequent analysis.","output":"Generation of VSV pseudotypes using recombinant G-VSV for studies on virus entry, identification of entry inhibitors, and immune responses to vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS: In 2013, the total number of obstetrician-gynecologists decreased. The Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology established the Obstetrics and Gynecology MIRAI Committee in 2015. Within the MIRAI Committee, Japanese Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynecology (JTOG) was established; it was comprised of 20 promising young obstetrician-gynecologists recommended from regions across Japan. The office term is 2 years. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to learn and inform about the results of MIRAI's activities. METHODS: We surveyed the trends in new obstetrician-gynecologists and also matched each seminar participant with them. RESULT: The number of new memberships has been increasing since the nadir in 2016. In particular, there are over 100 more new physicians specializing in the field in 2020 than there were at the nadir in 2016. It was revealed that approximately 50% of the participants in the summer school specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, approximately 70% of POP2 participants specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, which shows that these two recruitment seminars are extraordinarily effective events that result in an increase in the number of new obstetricians and gynecologists. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the activities of this MIRAI Committee and JTOG have been effective. With the spread of COVID-19 and the inability of obstetrician-gynecologists and students/clinical trainees to perform social distancing, it is currently difficult to hold hands-on seminars. However, we hope that new JTOG members will be able to create a new seminar format.","output":"Initiatives and achievements of the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecology MIRAI Committee 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a retrospective chart review examining the demographics, clinical history, physical findings, and comorbidities of patients with influenza and patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The psychological after-effects of this public health emergency on frontline nurses will last for years. AIM To assess factors influencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among frontline nurses in Wuhan 6 mo after the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHODS A total of 757 frontline nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in an online survey from July 27 to August 13, 2020. This cross-sectional online study used a demographic information questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the association of demographics, COVID-19-related variables, and PTSD. Logistic regression was also conducted to investigate which variables were associated with PTSD outcomes. RESULTS A total of 13.5%, 24.3%, and 21.4% of the frontline nurses showed symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors were strongly associated with PTSD: Having a relative, friend, or colleague who died of COVID-19;experiencing stigma;or having psychological assistance needs, depressive symptoms or anxiety. Showing resilience and receiving praise after the COVID-19 outbreak were protective factors. CONCLUSION Frontline nurses still experienced PTSD (13.5%) six months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. Peer support, social support, official recognition, reward mechanisms, exercise, better sleep, and timely provision of information (such as vaccine research progress) by the government via social media, and adequate protective supplies could mitigate the level of PTSD among nurses responding to COVID-19. Stigmatization, depression, and anxiety might be associated with a greater risk of PTSD among nurses.","output":"Cross-sectional study of traumatic stress disorder in frontline nurses 6 mo after the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION A large number de registries have been collected both kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19.

To reduce indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between persons, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal masking (the use of face masks in public places by everyone who is not fully vaccinated), and increased room ventilation (1). Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners* to reduce the number of infectious particles in the air and provide enhanced protection from transmission between persons (2); two recent reports found that HEPA air cleaners in classrooms could reduce overall aerosol particle concentrations by &#8805;80% within 30 minutes (3,4). To investigate the effectiveness of portable HEPA air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to exhaled aerosol particles, the investigation team used respiratory simulators to mimic a person with COVID-19 and other, uninfected persons in a conference room. The addition of two HEPA air cleaners that met the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-recommended clean air delivery rate (CADR) (5) reduced overall exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles by up to 65% without universal masking. Without the HEPA air cleaners, universal masking reduced the combined mean aerosol concentration by 72%. The combination of the two HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced overall exposure by up to 90%. The HEPA air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. These findings suggest that portable HEPA air cleaners can reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in indoor environments, with greater reductions in exposure occurring when used in combination with universal masking.","output":"Efficacy of Portable Air Cleaners and Masking for Reducing Indoor Exposure to Simulated Exhaled SARS-CoV-2 Aerosols  United States, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the features of 220 nonemergency (mild or common type) COVID-19 patients from a shelter hospital, as well as evaluate the efficiency of antiviral drug, Arbidol in their disease progressions.

Predicting disease trajectory is crucial for resource allocation and therapeutic intervention. In our single-center retrospective cohort analysis of the first 66 patients admitted for COVID-19 infection, we examined biomarkers of inflammation to distinguish non-critically ill inpatients who remained stable from those that had progressive respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer. Unlike the typical approach where patients are grouped into the two categories of non-critical and critical illness, COVID-19 patients in our study were classified into three cohorts by severity and stability of respiratory failure: stable non-critical illness (mild, 38 [58%]);non-critical illness at admission that progressed to critical illness (progressive, 21 [32%]);and critical illness at admission (severe, 7 [11%]). We found that while CRP level at admission was weakly associated with future progressive respiratory failure and appeared to have limited clinical utility. The progressive cohort showed modestly increased levels of CRP compared to the mild cohort, with significant overlap (125.0  74 vs. 81.3  57 mg/L, P = 0.05). Despite the limited predictive value of admission CRP levels, these measurements were indeed clinically relevant as they correlated with SOFA score ( = 0.41, P < 0.001) and hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2, r = -0.58, P < 0.001). A closer examination of CRP trend showed that dynamic trend of CRP levels within the first 72 hours of admission rather than the static CRP level at admission showed a much stronger association with respiratory deterioration. Specifically, rise in CRP levels most clearly distinguished mild and progressive cohorts (24-48h post-admission: 170.6  95 vs. 91.0  67 mg/L, P = 0.03;48-72h post-admission: 185.0  92 vs. 81.6  63 mg/L, P = 0.002). Trends of inflammatory biomarkers, rather than absolute value at admission, may have most value for clinical triage and targeting therapeutic immunomodulation.

Consequently, the main objective of this study is to investigate in the financial risks that associated with green lending and whether an increasing in green lending will decrease the non-performing loans ratio (NPLR) of UAE banks, based on the period 2015C2020 dataset of 23 UAEs banks. To achieve this objective, we have used a regression technique that includes a two-stage least square regression analysis and random-effect regression analysis to test if the increase in green credit ratio can reduce the NPL ratio in a sample of UAEs banks. The current study can be considered the first empirical attempt that conducted on the banking sector in UAE, to discover the variables that might have a direct impact on the NPL ratio. The results reveal that the ratio of green loans has a negative impact on the NPL ratio, as much as the return of equity, while the quality of credit, inefficiency, and the bank size have a positive impact on NPL ratio. But as was not as expected, we found that the impact of solvency ratio has a negative significant on the NPL ratio.

If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions.

Validated results showed a good agreement between model simulated and observed values, based on the normalized root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r). This agreement indicates that the DNDC model could capture patterns and magnitudes changes across the climate zone, soil type, and management practices. Modeled results pointed out that, under no-tillage practice (NT), the SOC content increased by 30% compared to conventional tillage (CT). During the simulated period (9 years), the SOC sequestration potential (CSP) has been greatly improved with increased crop residue rate and application of farmyard manure (FY-manure). This increase ranged from 415 kg C/ha to 1787 kg C/ha under NT practice, and from 150 kg C/ha to 818 kg C/ha under CT system.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a review of current literature related to surgical and clinical management of patients during COVID-19 crisis paying special attention to oncological ones and especially those suffering from PCa. Based on these publications and current urological guidelines, a manual to manage PCa patients is suggested. RESULTS: Patients suffering from cancer are likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 disease together with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the management of oncological patients should be taken into special consideration and most of the treatments postponed. In case the procedure is not deferrable, it should be adapted to the current situation. While the shortest radiotherapy (RT) regimens should be applied, surgical procedures must undergo the following recommendations proposed by main surgical associations. PCa prognosis is generally favourable and therefore one can safely delay most of the biopsies up to 6 months without interfering with survival outcomes in the vast majority of cases. In the same way, most of the localised PCa patients are suitable for active surveillance (AS) or hormonal therapy until local definitive treatment could be reconsidered. In metastatic as well as castration resistant PCa stages, adding androgen receptor targeted agents (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) could be considered in high risk patients. On the contrary, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and Radium-223 must be avoided with regard to the consequence of hematologic toxicity and risk of COVID-19 infection because of immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the biopsies should be delayed while AS is advised in those patients with low risk PCa. ADT allows us to defer definitive local treatment in many cases of intermediate and high risk PCa. In regard to metastatic and castration resistant PCa, combination therapies with abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide could be considered.

Our goal was to provide guidance for the development of eHealth tools for diverse older populations for use in geriatric care models. DESIGN Guidance for eHealth tools was compiled from user design resources and eHealth design literature. Pragmatic examples were provided from an evidenced-based eHealth tool called PREPAREforYourCare.org (PREPARE). We used quantitative feasibility data from PREPARE research studies and qualitative analysis of PREPARE focus groups, cognitive interviews, and feedback from randomized trials to further inform our recommendations. RESULTS Guidance and lessons learned include: (1) define clear objectives and a conceptual framework; (2) co-create with the target population; (3) optimize the design and layout for accessibility and ease of use, such as text at the 5th grade reading level, closed captioning, etc.; (4) use simple, standardized navigation design; (5) use actionable information to enhance behavior change, such as modeling of behaviors; (6) align accompanying written materials with the eHealth tool; and (7) create tracking mechanisms for ongoing user feedback.

Following a comprehensive internal root-cause investigation, it was hypothesized that prior prime-boost immunization of ferrets with a commercial canine C3 vaccine to protect against the canine distemper virus had resulted in primary immune response to fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the C3 preparation. Upon intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus cultured in medium containing FBS, an allergic airway response occurred in 6 out of 56 of the ferrets. The 6 impacted ferrets were randomly dispersed across study groups, including different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, routes of vaccine candidate administration, and controls (placebo). The root-cause investigation and subsequent analysis determined that the allergic reaction was unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine candidates under evaluation. Histological assessment suggested that the allergic response was characterized by eosinophilic airway disease; increased serum immunoglobulin levels reactive to FBS further suggested this response was caused by immune priming to FBS present in the C3 vaccine. This was further supported by in vivo studies demonstrating ferrets administered diluted FBS also presented clinical signs consistent with a hyperallergic response, while clinical signs were absent in ferrets that received a serum-free SARS-CoV-2 inoculum. It is therefore recommended that vaccine studies in higher order animals should consider the impact of welfare vaccination and use serum-free inoculum whenever possible.","output":"Type I Hypersensitivity in Ferrets Following Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Inoculum: Lessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an infection that is caused by the novel coronavirus. COVID-19 has severely affected the public health by causing more than 200 million cases and four million deaths worldwide. There are, presently, no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. As immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions to prevent this infectious disease, a number of vaccines, around 112, have been developed. In Saudi Arabia, many vaccination campaigns have already started. There are currently four approved COVID-19 vaccines but only three are available for use in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which a web-based survey was distributed to medical students in their clinical years at the College of Medicine in King Saud bin Abdulaziz University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 209 questionnaires were distributed. The survey assessed the demographic data, perception towards COVID-19 vaccine, barriers and predictors for accepting COVID-19 vaccine. Results Two-hundred and four respondents completed the survey with a response rate of 96.7%. Overall, 118 of the participants were males and 86 were females. Sixty-six percent of our participants had taken the vaccine. Of those, males and females were distributed equally in half. Fifty-three percent of the participants who had taken the vaccine aged 21-23. This age group had a significant effect on acceptance of the vaccine. Most common deterrent to taking COVID-19 vaccine was safety issues despite not having a statistical significance. In terms of motivators, the majority thought that fear of getting COVID-19 infection was the most important motivator to taking COVID-19 vaccine, which was statistically significant as well. Conclusion In the setting of spreading COVID-19 infection, the vaccine is still the solution to halting infection spread.

Early de-escalation of monitoring is likely feasible in a particular subset of patients, which may have implications in the post-COVID era. In this study, we examined when patients with AIS are susceptible to early neurologic decline (END) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) after IV tPA and whether those at low clinical risk of neurologic deterioration may be suitable for earlier transition to lower level of care. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of AIS receiving IV tPA based on AHA/ASA guidelines. We included those that presented within 4.5 hours of last seen well (LSW) without large vessel occlusion (LVO) or flow-limiting stenosis (FLS) on non-invasive angiographic imaging. Outcomes included END (4-point worsening of NIHSS at 24 hours) from any cause, parenchymal hemorrhage (PH1 or PH2), and/ or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH;4-point NIHSS worsening with presence of hemorrhage). Results: 1238 patients were included from 1/2013 - 6/2019. END and ICH occurred in 7.4% (91) and 9.4% (116), respectively. 63.7% of patients with END did not have ICH within 24 hours.

Previously, in human focal cerebral infarctions an early expression of macrophage-related protein-8 (MRP8/ S100A8), a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100-protein family, in microglia has been reported. On the other hand, a delayed activation of microglia was observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We therefore examined immunohistochemically microglial expression of MRP8 and allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1), identical to microglial response factor-1 (mrf-1) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (iba1) in human brains after TBI and in control brains. Both, MRP8 and AIF-1 are Ca(2+)-binding peptides which have been associated with microglial activation in experimental models and in human cerebral infarctions. Detection of AIF-1 in controls confirmed constitutive expression of this peptide in a subset of microglial cells. After TBI, the density of AIF-1(+) microglia did not increase significantly. Lesional expression of AIF-1 did not significantly differ from other brain regions. Furthermore, following TBI, we found no significant differences in the density of AIF-1(+) microglia as compared to controls. Microglial MRP8 expression was not detectable in controls and within the first 3 days post TBI, but increased rapidly after 3 days post TBI, suggesting a subpopulation of microglial cells to be AIF-1(C)/MRP8(+).

The study draws on the social determinants of health framework to explain the self-reported chronic health conditions (SR-CHCs) among 331 residents in Austin, Texas. The study employed non-linear techniques suitable for Poisson distribution to estimate the association between gentrification and SR-CHCs and complemented by direct quotes from in-depth interviews (IDIs). Perceived gentrification score significantly vary by marital status (p < 0.001), educational attainment (p < 0.001), and gender (p < 0.01), while SR-CHCs only significantly varies by educational attainment, p = 0.015). Multivariate results show that gentrification was positively associated with SR-CHCs, after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Compared to the Hispanics, blacks were 97% more likely to report multiple counts of SR-CHCs (IRR = 1.969, 95% CI 1.074C3.608), and participants with high household income were 8% less likely to report multiple CHCs (IRR = 0.920, 95% CI 0.870C0.973).

Growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 frequently causes coagulopathy, presenting as hypercoagulation and incidental thrombosis. For these reasons, a multifactorial approach with several anticoagulant markers should be considered in the management of anticoagulation using heparin in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man was infected with COVID-19 with a worsening condition manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was refractory to conventional therapy, thus we decided to introduce V-V ECMO. We used heparin as an anticoagulant therapy for V-V ECMO and adjusted the doses of heparin by careful monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to avoid both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. We controlled the doses of heparin in the therapeutic ranges of ACT and APTT, but clinical hemorrhaging and profound elevation of coagulant marker became apparent. INTERVENTIONS: Using thromboelastography (TEG; Haemonetics) in addition to ACT and APTT, we were able to clearly detect not only sufficient coagulability of COVID19 on V-V ECMO (citrated rapid thromboelastography-R 0.5 min, angle 75.5, MA 64.0 mm, citrated functional fibrinogen-MA 20.7 mm) but also an excessive effect of heparin (citrated kaolin -R 42.7 min, citrated kaolin with heparinase 11.7 min). OUTCOMES: Given the TEG findings indicating an excessive heparin effect, the early withdrawal of ECMO was considered. After an evaluation of the patient's respiratory capacity, withdrawal from V-V ECMO was achieved and then anticoagulation was stopped. The hemorrhagic complications and elevated thrombotic marker levels dramatically decreased. LESSONS: TEG monitoring might be a useful option for managing anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO frequently showing a hypercoagulative state and requiring massive doses of heparin, to reduce both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.","output":"Efficacy of thromboelastography in the management of anticoagulation for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DrugCdrug interactions play a vital role in drug research.

Among these methods, the literature-based method is special because it combines the extraction method of DDI and the prediction method of DDI. We first introduce the common databases, then briefly describe each method, and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of some prediction models. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of machine learning methods in predicting drug interactions. This review aims to provide useful guidance for interested researchers to further promote bioinformatics algorithms to predict DDI.","output":"A Review of Approaches for Predicting DrugCDrug Interactions Based on Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is going through the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020. However, the pandemic appears to be less severe in highly dengue endemic countries. In this connection, several studies reported that sero-diagnostic tests for DV yielded considerable false-positive results for SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa in dengue endemic regions, thereby indicating towards potential cross-reactivity between these two viruses. We anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 and DV might share antigenic similarity and performed computational docking studies to test this hypothesis. Our results predicted with high confidence that human DV antibodies can indeed, bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Some of these interactions can also potentially intercept human ACE2 receptor binding to RBM. Dengue serum samples predating the COVID-19, had been found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and this provides direct experimental validation of our predictions. Our analysis also showed that m396 and 80R antibodies (against SARS-CoV-1) did not dock with RBM of SARS-CoV-2, a fact already proven experimentally. This confirmed reliability and robustness of our approach. So, it is highly probable that immunological memory/antibodies to DV in endemic countries may reduce the severity and spread of COVID-19. It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will hinder DV infections by binding to DV particles and reduce dengue incidences in the future or, augment DV infection and severity by deploying antibody-dependent enhancement.","output":"Computational modelling supports that Dengue virus envelope antibodies can bind to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding sites: Is pre-exposure to dengue virus protective against COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDuring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate threat of illness and mortality is not the only concern. In the United States, COVID-19 is not only causing physical suffering to patients, but also great levels of adverse sentiment (e.g., fear, panic, anxiety) among the public. Such secondary threats can be anticipated and explained through sentiment analysis of social media, such as Twitter. MethodsWe obtained a dataset of geotagged tweets on the topic of COVID-19 in the contiguous United States during the period of 11/1/2019 - 9/15/2020. We classified each tweet into \\"adverse\\" and \\"non-adverse\\" using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and tallied up the counts for each category per county per day. We utilized the space-time scan statistic to find clusters and a three-stage regression approach to identify socioeconomic and demographic correlates of adverse sentiment. ResultsWe identified substantial spatiotemporal variation in adverse sentiment in our study area/period. After an initial period of low-level adverse sentiment (11/1/2019 - 1/15/2020), we observed a steep increase and subsequent fluctuation at a higher level (1/16/2020 - 9/15/2020). The number of daily tweets was low initially (11/1/2019 - 1/22/2020), followed by spikes and subsequent decreases until the end of the study period. The space-time scan statistic identified 12 clusters of adverse sentiment of varying size, location, and strength. Clusters were generally active during the time period of late March to May/June 2020. Increased adverse sentiment was associated with decreased racial/ethnic heterogeneity, decreased rurality, higher vulnerability in terms of minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. ConclusionsWe utilized a dataset of geotagged tweets to identify the spatiotemporal patterns and the spatial correlates of adverse population sentiment during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The characteristics of areas with high adverse sentiment may be relevant for communication of containment measures. The combination of spatial clustering and regression can be beneficial for understanding of the ramifications of COVID-19, as well as disease outbreaks in general.","output":"Understanding Adverse Population Sentiment Towards the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, oncologists face new challenges, and they need to adjust their cancer management strategies as soon as possible to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and tumor recurrence. However, data on cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains scarce. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on 223 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 from 26 hospitals in Hubei, China. An individualized nomogram was constructed based on multivariate Cox analysis. Considering the convenience of the nomogram application, an online tool was also created. The predictive performance and clinical application of nomogram were verified by C-index, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Among cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2, there were significant differences in clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors, and compared with patients with solid tumors including lung cancer, patients with hematological malignancies had a worse prognosis. Male, dyspnea, elevated PCT, increased heart rate, elevated D-dimers, and decreased platelets were risk factors for these patients. Furthermore, a good prediction performance of the online tool (dynamic nomogram: https://covid-19-prediction-tool.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/ ) was also fully demonstrated with the C-indexes of 0.841 (95% CI 0.782-0.900) in the development cohort and 0.780 (95% CI 0.678-0.882) in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: Overall, cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 had unique clinical features, and the established online tool could guide clinicians to predict the prognosis of patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and to develop more rational treatment strategies for cancer patients.","output":"An online tool for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal death represents a major burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the main conditions triggering mortality, such as prematurity, labor complications, infections, and respiratory distress syndrome, are frequently worsened by hypothermia, which dramatically scales up the risk of death.

The antibacterial film was formed into an active antibacterial gasket, and its effect on salmon preservation was analyzed. The results show that the LL/PCL nanofiber membrane had a well-developed microstructure, and the fiber surface was smooth and uniform. The diameter of the fibers in the PCL membrane without the core material (linalool) was 113.92  23.74 nm. In contrast, the diameter of the coaxial nanofiber membrane with linalool increased, and the diameter of the LL/PCL membranes with 20% and 40% linalool was 220.62  44.01 and 232.22  56.27 nm, respectively. The hydrophobicity and water vapor permeability were enhanced, whereas the tensile strength and elongation at break decreased slightly, while the thermal stability did not differ significantly with the incorporation of linalool. Analysis of the sustained release of linalool showed that the LL/PCL coaxial fiber membranes could release linalool into the reaction system for a long time. The LL/PCL nanofiber film was used to create an antibacterial active gasket for salmon preservation experiments. Sensory evaluation and analyses of the total bacterial count, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), pH, texture (hardness, elasticity, chewiness, and viscoelasticity), water distribution change, and aroma using an electronic nose were used to determine the quality of salmon. It was found that food-grade tinfoil and the PCL gasket had no significant effect on the freshness of salmon, while the active antibacterial gasket samples containing linalool could decrease the rate of decay salmon and effectively prolong the shelf-life of salmon by releasing linalool.","output":"Preparation of Linalool/Polycaprolactone Coaxial Electrospinning Film and Application in Preserving Salmon Slices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a method to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across regions with a focus on the role of mobility.

We assess the quality of forecasting on the detailed level of municipalities, instead of on a nation-wide level. To model transmissions, we use a simple mobility-enhanced SEIR compartmental model with subpopulations corresponding to the Dutch municipalities. We use commuter information to quantify mobility, and develop a method based on maximum likelihood estimation to determine the other relevant parameters.

However, in the 10 months after its first case, Rwanda recorded 10316 cases and 133 COVID-19-related deaths translating to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.3%, which raised the question: why does Rwanda have a low COVID-19 CFR? Here we analysed COVID-19 data and explored possible explanations to better understand the disease burden in the context of Rwandas infection control strategies. We investigated whether the age distribution plays a role in the observed low CFR in Rwanda by comparing the expected number of deaths for 10-year age bands based on the CFR reported in other countries with the observed number of deaths for each age group. We found that the age-specific CFRs in Rwanda are similar to or, in some older age groups, slightly higher than those in other countries, suggesting that the lower population level CFR reflects the younger age structure in Rwanda, rather than a lower risk of death conditional on age. We also accounted for Rwandas comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies and reliable documentation of COVID-19-related deaths and deduced that these measures may have allowed them to likely identify more asymptomatic or mild cases than other countries and reduced their reported CFR. Overall, the observed low COVID-19 deaths in Rwanda is likely influenced by the combination of effective infection control strategies, reliable identification of cases and reporting of deaths, and the populations young age structure.","output":"One hundred thirty-three observed COVID-19 deaths in 10 months: unpacking lower than predicted mortality in Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Short-term antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown previously.

Except for one participant in whom rheumatoid arthritis existed, all other cases were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2C10 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against wild type at 6 and 12 months and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants at month 12. Three binding antibody assays were used, targeting the nucleocapsid protein (NCP), the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain (RBD). RESULTS: Antibodies to the RBD persisted for 12 months in all cases with increasing concentrations, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below cut-off point in 7 participants and NCP antibodies were above cut-off point in only 5 subjects at month 12. The NAb against wild type were detected in all but 2 samples at 12 months of follow-up but clearly less frequently when targeting the variants. In 5 participants who were vaccinated against COVID-19 there was a strong increase of antibodies against S1 and RBD as well as an increase of NAb titres against wild type and the variants.

In this study, we have examined how MHC II ubiquitination impacts the composition and function of both conventional CD4+ T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) compartments. Responses were examined in two models of altered MHC II ubiquitination: MHCIIKRKI /KI mice that express a mutant MHC II unable to be ubiquitinated or mice that lack membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for MHC II ubiquitination specifically in thymic epithelial cells. Conventional CD4+ T cell populations in thymus, blood, and spleen of MHCIIKRKI/KI and March8 -/- mice were largely unaltered. In MLRs, March8 -/-, but not MHCIIKRKI/KI, CD4+ T cells had reduced reactivity to both self- and allogeneic MHC II. Thymic Treg were significantly reduced in MHCIIKRKI/KI mice, but not March8 -/- mice, whereas splenic Treg were unaffected. Neither scenario provoked autoimmunity, with no evidence of immunohistopathology and normal levels of autoantibody.

The major outcome measures were crude number of in-hospital deaths, deaths per 1000 discharges, and standardised mortality ratio. RESULTS Primary analysis of data from 2 years before and 2 years after EMR go-live showed a reduction in absolute mortality of 33 deaths, a reduction in the mortality rate of 0.48 per 1000 discharges (95% CI 0.09, 0.88 per 1000): and a relative 22% decrease (95% CI: 4%, 36%, P = 0.02) in deaths per 1000 discharges from 2.20 to 1.72.

Early recognition reduces morbidity and mortality, and supporting clinicians in ruling out SBIs may limit unnecessary admissions and antibiotic use. METHODS A prospective, diagnostic accuracy study of clinical and biomarker variables in the diagnosis of SBIs (pneumonia or other SBI) in febrile children <16 years old. A diagnostic model was derived by using multinomial logistic regression and internally validated. External validation of a published model was undertaken, followed by model updating and extension by the inclusion of procalcitonin and resistin. RESULTS There were 1101 children studied, of whom 264 had an SBI. A diagnostic model discriminated well between pneumonia and no SBI (concordance statistic 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.78-0.90) and between other SBIs and no SBI (0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.83) on internal validation. A published model discriminated well on external validation. Model updating yielded good calibration with good performance at both high-risk (positive likelihood ratios: 6.46 and 5.13 for pneumonia and other SBI, respectively) and low-risk (negative likelihood ratios: 0.16 and 0.13, respectively) thresholds.

This study determined neutralizing antibody titers (NT(50)) and antibodies against spike protein (SP) or nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigens approximately 6 months after the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 survivors in Japan were recruited. Serum samples and data related to patients characteristics and COVID-19 history were collected. NT(50) and titers of antibodies against NP and SP antigens were measured at 20C32 weeks after the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test results. Factors associated with NT(50) were identified using the multivariable linear regression and the correlations among NT(50) and titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and total immunoglobulins (Igs) against NP and SP were assessed by Spearmans correlation. Results: Among 376 participants (median [range] days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 180 (147C224); median [range] years of age, 50 (20C78); 188 [50%] male), most tested positive for NT(50) (n = 367, 98%), SP-IgG (n = 344, 91%), SP-total Ig (n = 369, 98%), NP-IgG (n = 314, 84%), and NP-total Ig (n = 365, 97%).

Similarly, two allogeneic clonal transmissible cancers have killed thousands of wild Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and also modulate MHC-I expression to evade anti-cancer and allograft responses. IFNG treatment restores MHC-I expression on devil facial tumor (DFT) cells but is insufficient to control tumor growth. Transcriptional co-activator NLRC5 is a master regulator of MHC-I in humans and mice but its role in transmissible cancers remains unknown. In this study, we explored the regulation and role of MHC-I in these unique genetically mis-matched tumors. METHODS: We used transcriptome and flow cytometric analyses to determine how MHC-I shapes allogeneic and anti-tumor responses. Cell lines that overexpress NLRC5 to drive antigen presentation, and B2M-knockout cell lines incapable of presenting antigen on MHC-I were used to probe the role of MHC-I in rare cases of tumor regressions. RESULTS: Transcriptomic results suggest that NLRC5 plays a major role in MHC-I regulation in devils. NLRC5 was shown to drive the expression of many components of the antigen presentation pathway but did not upregulate PDL1. Serum from devils with tumor regressions showed strong binding to IFNG-treated and NLRC5 cell lines; antibody binding to IFNG-treated and NRLC5 transgenic tumor cells was diminished or absent following B2M knockout. CONCLUSION: MHC-I could be identified as a target for anti-tumor and allogeneic immunity. Consequently, NLRC5 could be a promising target for immunotherapy and vaccines to protect devils from transmissible cancers and inform development of transplant and cancer therapies for humans.

A total of 11,000 doses of influenza vaccine, single-dose prefilled syringes, were provided free to HCWs at 29 selected hospitals, clinics, and research institutes in four provinces: Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak and Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: Before the campaign, a workshop was organized to discuss an implementation plan including technical requirements, cold chain, uptake reporting, and surveillance for adverse events following immunization. All sites distributed communication materials and encouraged their staff to register for vaccination. Following immunization sessions, sites sent reports on uptake and adverse events following immunization. Left-over vaccine was transferred to other sites to maximize vaccine use. RESULTS: The average uptake was 57% for all health care workers, with 11 sites achieving 90% and above. These 11 sites were small with less than 500 staff, including 5 primary hospitals, 3 preventive medicine units, and 2 referral hospitals. Among the six biggest sites with over 1000 staff, four sites had the lowest uptake (14C47%). Most of the high-uptake sites were from the central to the south; only one site, a referral hospital, was from the north. After redistribution of left-over vaccine, only 130 vaccine doses (1.2%) were not used and destroyed. Based on factors that affected uptake, including registration levels, differing communication strategies, availability of vaccination, and commitment by health facility leaders, we recommended ways to increase health care worker coverage; recommendations to improve reporting adverse events following immunization were also made. CONCLUSIONS: The project demonstrated that it was feasible to conduct influenza vaccination campaigns among health care workers in Vietnam.

Over a quarter of the worlds population is estimated to have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), with 5C10% expected to develop active TB. Hepatotoxicity is a well described side-effect of anti-tuberculosis medication, often leading to disruptions in treatment. Currently, NICE guidelines recommend careful liver function test (LFT) monitoring of patients on anti-tuberculosis medication with liver disease, abnormal baseline LFTs or with history of alcohol or hepatotoxic drug misuse. However, there is no specific guidance on LFT monitoring for routine treatment.MethodsAll patients with LTBI in a single centre were identified from hospital records over a 3-year period (January 2018-December 2020). Clinical notes and blood test results were analysed for all patients, identifying any drug induced liver injury (DILI). Frequency and timing of LFT monitoring once starting treatment was reviewed and correlated with patient symptoms.ResultsOver a 3-year period, 180 patients received treatment for LTBI. 169 patients (94%) had baseline LFTs measured. 7 patients (3.9%) had deranged LFTs during their treatment, with 3 (1.7%) meeting the criteria for DILI. 2 of the 3 patients (66%) with DILI were symptomatic prompting blood tests, 1 patient (33%) had abnormal baseline LFTs. Of the 7 patients with LFT derangement during treatment, 4 (57%) had deranged baseline LFTs, 4 (57%) were symptomatic. Only 1 patient had neither symptoms nor abnormal baseline LFTs, but had abnormal baseline renal function requiring regular monitoring.ConclusionsThese results suggest that risk of DILI is present but relatively low in patients receiving treatment for LTBI. Most patients from this cohort with DILI were either high risk as per NICE guidance or symptomatic prompting LFT checking. Therefore, routine monitoring of LFTs for all patients on LTBI treatment is unlikely to be cost-effective or change treatment outcomes. Instead, LFT monitoring should be considered specifically for patients that are high risk or with symptoms of DILI.ReferencesNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (2016) Tuberculosis.

AIMS: We aimed to prospectively determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is detected via real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the GI tract of patients scheduled for endoscopy and if the virus obtained from these clinical specimens could be isolated in culture. METHODS: All patients underwent symptom screening and had negative nasopharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours of their scheduled procedure. Study samples were collected via repeat nasopharyngeal swab, rectal swab, and fluid from the upper GI tract and/or colon based on their endoscopic procedure(s). Samples were tested for SARSCoV-2 via rRT-PCR. Clinical specimens confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA were then isolated and cultured in Vero-E6 cells. RESULTS: 243 patients (mean age 63.1 years;54.3% men) were enrolled from July 15th, 2020 to September 2nd, 2020 (Table 1). Most patients (177;72.8%) were asymptomatic, with nausea/vomiting (23;9.5%) being the most commonly reported COVID-19 related symptom.

The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1C35.4 with the PK-DNase method, 34.7C39.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9C38.6 with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control Ct of 33.2 (both P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The PK-DNase method is suitable for homogenizing sputum samples prior to RNA extraction.","output":"Comparative Evaluation of Three Homogenization Methods for Isolating Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleic Acids From Sputum Samples for Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the COVID-19 pandemic as a context for learning about the role of science in a global health crisis.

Mice vaccinated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation are protected against lethal sepsis following Candida albicans/Staphylococcus aureus (Ca/Sa) intra-abdominal infection (IAI) or Ca bloodstream infection (BSI). The protection against IAI is mediated by long-lived Gr-1(+) leukocytes as putative myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and not by prototypical trained macrophages. This study aimed to determine if a similar TII mechanism (Gr-1(+) cell-mediated suppression of sepsis) is protective against BSI and whether this TII can also be induced following intravenous (i.v.) vaccination. For this, mice were vaccinated with low-virulence Candida strains (i.p. or i.v.), followed by lethal challenge (Ca/Sa i.p. or Ca i.v.) 14 days later, and observed for sepsis (hypothermia, sepsis scoring, and serum cytokines), organ fungal burden, and mortality. Similar parameters were monitored following depletion of macrophages or Gr-1(+) leukocytes during lethal challenge. The results showed that mice vaccinated i.p. or i.v. were protected against lethal Ca/Sa IAI or Ca BSI. In all cases, protection was mediated by Ly6G(+) Gr-1(+) putative granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs), with no role for macrophages, and correlated with reduced sepsis parameters. Protection also correlated with reduced fungal burden in spleen and brain but not liver or kidney. These results suggest that Ly6G(+) G-MDSC-mediated TII is induced by either the i.p. and i.v. route of inoculation and protects against IAI or BSI forms of systemic candidiasis, with survival correlating with amelioration of sepsis and reduced organ-specific fungal burden.","output":"Trained Innate Immunity Induced by Vaccination with Low-Virulence Candida Species Mediates Protection against Several Forms of Fungal Sepsis via Ly6G(+) Gr-1(+) Leukocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective, observational study was performed in a university ICU from March to June 2020 (first wave) and from September 2020 to January 2021 (second wave). In first wave, patients received bundle 1 including early invasive ventilation, hydroxychloroquine, cefotaxime and azithromycin. In second wave, bundle 2 included non-invasive oxygenation support and dexamethasone. The main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, ICU supportive therapies, viral clearance and antimicrobial resistance emergence. RESULTS: 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were admitted to our ICU. Thirty-five were treated according to bundle 1 and 76 to bundle 2. In-hospital mortality was similar in the two groups (23%, p = 1). The hospital (p = 0.003) and ICU (p = 0.01) length of stay and ventilator-free days at 28 days (p = 0.03) were significantly reduced in bundle 2.

It ameliorated inflammatory responses and protected against acute lung inflammation in animal models. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a kind of inflammatory disease in which alveolar cells are damaged. However, a network pharmacology study to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms preventing ALI has not been performed. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we examined the main active ingredients in LJF and the protective effects of LJF on LPS-induced ALI in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the main active ingredients of LJF were screened in the TCMSP database, and the ALI-associated targets were collected from the GeneCards database. Then, we used compound-target and target-pathway networks to uncover the preventive mechanisms of LJF. Furthermore, we assessed the preventive effects of LJF in an LPS-induced rat model with the RNA-Seq technique to validate the possible molecular mechanisms of the effects of LJF in the treatment of ALI. RESULTS: The network pharmacology results identified 28 main active compounds in LJF, and eight chemical components highly related to the potential targets, which were potential active compounds in LJF. In all, 94 potential targets were recognized, including IL6, TNF, PTGS2, APP, F2, and GRM5. The pathways revealed that the possible targets of LJF involved in the regulation of the IL-17 signalling pathway. Then, in vivo experiments indicated that LJF decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, decreased the levels of oxidative stress factors (MDA and MPO) and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in lung tissue. The RNA-Seq results revealed that 7811, 775 and 3654 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Ctrl (control group), ALI-LJF (Lonicerae japonicae flos group) and ALI-DXSM (dexamethasone group), respectively. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs associated with immune response and inflammation signalling pathways and the IL-17 signalling pathway were significantly enriched in LJF. Compared with those in ALI, the expression of CXCL2, CXCL1, CXCL6, NFKBIA, IFNG, IL6, IL17A, IL17F, IL17C, MMP9 and TNFAIP3, which are involved in the IL-17 signalling pathway, were significantly decreased in the LJF group according to the qRT-PCR analyses.

We also explored the role of lymphatics in early peripheral arterial disease. METHODS After informed consent and following intradermal injections of indocyanine green for rapid lymphatic uptake, near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging was employed to assess lymphatic anatomical structure and quantify lymphatic propulsion rates in subjects with early venous insufficiency. Anatomical observations included interstitial backflow, characterized by the abnormal spreading of indocyanine green from the injection site primarily into the surrounding interstitial tissues; dermal backflow, characterized by the retrograde movement of dye-laden lymph from collecting lymphatics into the lymphatic capillaries; and lymphatic vessel segmentation and dilation. RESULTS Ten venous insufficiency subjects were enrolled, resulting in three legs with C2 disease, eight legs with C3, eight legs with C4 disease, and one leg with C5 disease. Interstitial and/or dermal backflow were observed in 25%, 33%, and 41% of injection sites in each limb with C2, C3, and C4 disease, respectively. Distinct vessel segmentation and dilation was observed in limbs with C3 and higher classification, and dermal backflow proximal to the injection sites was observed in two legs with C4 disease and in the inguinal region of the C5 study subject. Overall average lymph propulsion rates were 1.30.4 contractile events/min, 1.20.7 events/min, and 0.80.5 events/min for limbs with C2, C3, and C4 disease respectively. One subject with peripheral arterial disease, who had previously undergone bypass surgery, presented with extensive dermal backflow and lymphatic reflux. CONCLUSIONS Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging demonstrate that, compared to normal health subjects, lymphatic anatomy and contractile function generally degrade with severity of venous insufficiency. Lymphatic abnormalities mimic those in early cancer-acquired lymphedema subjects, as previously observed by us and others.

CASE: A 27-year-old male patient presented with acute epididymitis secondary to acute Chlamydia infection that progressed to multisystem inflammatory failure with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, cardiogenic shock with heart failure, and gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction. He tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab thrice within 4 days of presentation, but positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibody signifying remote infection. The patient was treated with tocilizumab and steroids, along with doxycycline for concurrent Chlamydia infection, resulting in dramatic improvement in all organ function.

In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine what fabrics would be most effective in both practices. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (cotton, polyester, silk), as measured by their resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Laboratory-based tests were conducted when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier for respirators and when constructed as face coverings. When used as material in these two situations, silk was more effective at impeding the penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested fabrics. We found that silk face coverings repelled droplets in spray tests as well as disposable single-use surgical masks, and silk face coverings have the added advantage over masks such that they can be sterilized for immediate reuse. We show that silk is a hydrophobic barrier to droplets, can be more breathable than other fabrics that trap humidity, and are re-useable via cleaning. We suggest that silk can serve as an effective material for making hydrophobic barriers that protect respirators, and silk can now be tested under clinical conditions to verify its efficacy for this function.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites.

We proposed a simple approach to disentangle the effect of school closures from other lockdown measures on the pandemic course based on publicly available data in Germany. METHODS We used data on the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases from the onset of the pandemic to 14th April 2021. We compared the proportion of children (5-14 years old) in all cases prior to the lockdown measures, including school closure, to that during a ten-week lockdown in Germany. The total number of paediatric cases occurring during lockdown was compared to the number expected in absence of school closures. The latter was calculated based on the actual weekly number of all cases and the pre-lockdown proportion of paediatric cases. RESULTS The proportion of children in all cases was 2.3 percentage points lower at the nadir than the proportion before the lockdown. The estimated total number of paediatric cases prevented by school closures was estimated at 13,246 amounting to 24% of the expected cases in absence of school closures. CONCLUSION School closure during the winter lockdown reduced the number of expected SARS-CoV-2 cases in children in absence of school closures. The contribution of these prevented cases to the total population incidence is small.

CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department 7 hours after an intentional overdose of hydroxychloroquine. Initial presentation demonstrated proximal muscle weakness. The patient was found to have a QRS complex of 134 ms and QTc of 710 ms. He was treated with early orotracheal intubation and intravenous diazepam boluses. Due to difficulties formulating continuous diazepam infusions, we opted to utilize an intermitted intravenous bolus strategy that achieved similar effects that a continuous infusion would. The patient recovered without residual side effects. DISCUSSION: Hydroxychloroquine toxicity is rare but projected to increase in frequency given its selection as a potential modality to treat COVID-19 disease. It is important for clinicians to recognize the unique effects of hydroxychloroquine poisoning and initiate appropriate emergency maneuvers to improve the outcomes in these patients.","output":"Intentional Hydroxychloroquine Overdose Treated with High-Dose Diazepam: an Increasing Concern in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigate work-nonwork boundary management among workers who transitioned to remote work Based on five waves of data and a sample of 155 remote workers, we find that the preference for segmentation was associated with greater work-nonwork balance We also found that having a dedicated office space within the home and fewer household members was associated with greater work-nonwork balance However, these variables did not moderate the relationship between segmentation preferences and work-nonwork balance as expected We discuss implications for future research on boundary management processes and practices (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Boundary management and work-nonwork balance while working from home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence of hip fracture has not changed. Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative.

However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the autophagic pathway and whether autophagy contributes to virus infection in vivo is unclear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2-triggered autophagy in animal models, including the long-tailed or crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, and xenografted human lung tissues. In Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells, SARS-CoV-2 induces autophagosome formation, accompanied by consistent autophagic events, including inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway and activation of the ULK-1-Atg13 and VPS34-VPS15-Beclin1 complexes, but it blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Modulation of autophagic elements, including the VPS34 complex and Atg14, but not Atg5, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, this study represents the first to demonstrate that the mouse bearing xenografted human lung tissue is a suitable model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and that autophagy inhibition suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and ameliorates virus-associated pneumonia in human lung tissues. We also observed a critical role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection in an hACE2 transgenic mouse model. This study, therefore, gives insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 manipulates autophagosome formation, and we suggest that autophagy-inhibiting agents might be useful as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Insights into the virus-host interactions contribute substantially to the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. The novelty of this study is the use of a new animal model: mice xenografted with human lung tissues.

METHODS: We made use of data on COVID-19 testing from 103,049 participants of the UK Biobank (mean age 71.5 years, 54.2% female), coupled to immunization records of the last ten years. Using logistic regression, covarying for age, sex, respiratory disease diagnosis, and socioeconomic status, we tested whether individuals vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis, differed from individuals that had only received other vaccinations on 1) undergoing a COVID-19 test, 2) being diagnosed with COVID-19, and 3) whether they developed severe COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We found that individuals with registered diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations are less likely to develop severe COVID-19 than people who had only received other vaccinations (diphtheria odds ratio (OR)=0.47, p-value=5.3*10(-5); tetanus OR=0.52, p-value=1.2*10(-4)). DISCUSSION: These results indicate that a history of diphtheria or tetanus vaccinations is associated with less severe manifestations of COVID-19.

This longstanding question for governments around the world is felt acutely in the context of the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics. Many countries have laws and policies that criminalise behaviours, making same-sex relationships, illicit drug use, and sex work illegal. Meanwhile, some countries have enshrined gender- and rights-protective institutions in law. Under the global AIDS strategy of the last five years, national AIDS response efforts in countries have focused on reaching people living with HIV with testing and antiretroviral treatment to suppress the HIV virus, preventing mortality and HIV transmission. At the end of this 5-year push, this article provides an ecological analysis of whether those countries with criminalising legal environments achieved more or less success. In countries where same-sex relationships were fully criminalised, the portion of people living with HIV who knew their status was 11% lower and viral suppression rates were 8% lower. Under sex-work criminalization, the rate of people living with HIV who knew their status was 10% lower and viral suppression 6% lower. Drug use criminalisation was associated with 14% lower knowledge of status and viral. On the other hand in countries with laws advancing non-discrimination, human rights institutions, and gender-based violence response, HIV services indicators were significantly better. This ecological evidence on the relationships between the legal environment and successful HIV response provides support for a strategy that includes a focus on law reform to achieve goals missed in 2020. Summary Box Countries around the world, across economic and geographic boundaries, have taken different approaches to the application of criminal law to same-sex sex, sex work, and drug usewith most taking a partially or fully criminalising legal approach in one or more of these areas. In tackling the AIDS pandemic, globally agreed goals for 2020 focused on ensuring most people living with HIV were aware of their HIV status and had suppressed the HIV virus through effective antiretroviral treatment. The AIDS response in countries that criminalised was less successful than those that did notachieving significantly lower levels of HIV status knowledge and HIV viral suppression. Countries with clear laws advancing non-discrimination, human rights institutions, and gender-based violence response had better knowledge of HIV status and viral suppression rates. This analysis suggests a new global AIDS strategy that includes a focus on law reform may hold promise in achieving goals that were missed in 2020.","output":"Law, Criminalisation and HIV in the World: Have countries that criminalise achieved more or less successful AIDS pandemic response?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the rules governing the prevention and control of contagious diseases in occupied territory under international law.

Given that the Association of American Medical Colleges and Society of Neurological Surgeons have recommended neurosurgery residency programs for the 2021 residency application cycle cancel away rotations and in-person interviews, our objective was to evaluate cost savings to medical students applying during this time and the implications. METHODS Utilizing the 2019-2020 Texas STAR Dashboard database, we queried responses from neurosurgery residency applicants. We recorded application costs, away rotation costs, interview costs, and total costs for medical school seniors applying to neurosurgery residency. Demographic information for applicants was also recorded. Mean and median costs were reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was utilized to determine differences in mean costs by medical school region. RESULTS Our cohort included 121 US allopathic applicants to neurosurgery residency. Mean application costs were $1,711, away rotation costs were $3,840, interview costs were $6,400, and total costs were $11,882. No significant difference was observed for mean total costs for applicants from schools in the central ($10,525/applicant), northeast ($11,311/applicant), south ($12,660/applicant) and west ($12,404/applicant) (p=0.181).

SETTING: Canada, Vancouver. METHODS: Participants were from a convenience sample of 14 adults with SCI/D (age 21C63 y) which include those with lumbar to low cervical impairments currently exercising at least once per week using cardiovascular exercise equipment at our Physical Activity Research Centre. The interventions were non-randomized steady-state exercise bouts at self-selected low and moderate workloads on the AROW and ACE for 5 min each. Our primary outcomes were the rate of oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) and the Borg 0C10 Rating Scale of Perceived Exertion (RPE). RESULTS: A repeated measures two-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) indicated that exercising on the AROW resulted significantly greater oxygen consumption and perceived exertion than ACE at similar sub-maximal workloads which may be explained by the differences in efficiency between the devices (Partial eta squared = 0.84, F stat = 48.25; Partial eta squared = 0.86, F stat = 53.54).

The prescription of enterosorbents is appropriate as a primary measure for the treatment of the acute diarrhea for effective prevention of the fluid and electrolyte loss, as well as method for symptom relief of the attack of the disease. Aim of the study - the antidiarrheal efficacy and safety study of high-dispersion silicon dioxide enterosorbent in tablet dosage form in patients with acute diarrhea. This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently. It has been postulated that symptoms and signs of acute diarrhea have to be caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract and did not associated with moderate-to-severe systemic states. 144 patients with established acute diarrhea were randomized into treatment group (enterosorbent Carbowhite, n = 120) or placebo group. Date collection including severity diarrhea, systemic symptoms was performed at baseline and daily during 7 days. Stool examination and serological assay were performed at baseline. The primary end points were declared as time to complete recovery from acute diarrhea. It has been found that the use of the siliceous enterosorbent (Carbowhite) allowed to reduce (p < 0.001) the treatment period averagely for 0.9 days (95% confidence interval 0.5C1.2 days) in comparison with placebo. Data of safety monitoring has revealed that both patient groups had negative stool culture, while initiation of antibiotic treatment was run more frequently in placebo group (8.3%) compared to investigational product group (4.1%, P = 0.044). The siliceous enterosorbent Carbowhite was well tolerated and reduced the recovery time of the acute episode of the diarrhea in the clinically significant form.","output":"Colloidal Silicon Dioxide in Tablet form (Carbowhite) Efficacy in Patients with Acute Diarrhea: Results of Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] RNA is a functionally rich molecule with multilevel, hierarchical structures whose role in the adsorption to molecular substrates is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we introduce a multiscale simulation approach that combines a tractable coarse-grained RNA structural model with an interaction potential of a structureless flat adsorbing substrate. Within this approach, we study the specific role of stem-hairpin and multibranch RNA secondary structure motifs on its adsorption phenomenology. Our findings identify a dual regime of adsorption for short RNA fragments with and without the secondary structure and underline the adsorption efficiency in both cases as a function of the surface interaction strength. The observed behavior results from an interplay between the number of contacts formed at the surface and the conformational entropy of the RNA molecule. The adsorption phenomenology of RNA seems to persist also for much longer RNAs as qualitatively observed by comparing the trends of our simulations with a theoretical approach based on an ideal semiflexible polymer chain.","output":"RNA Secondary Structures Regulate Adsorption of Fragments onto Flat Substrates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospices to look for more ways to support people remotely, including psychological support. Emotional disclosure-based interventions hold potential as a way of providing support remotely. However, evidence of their efficacy in people with terminal illness is mixed. Reviews have highlighted this may be due to interventions not being tailored to the unique needs of this population. In response to this, we are developing Let It Out (LIO), an online, self-guided emotional disclosure-based intervention tailored for people living with terminal illness. AIMS: The primary objective of the study is to optimise the design of the LIO intervention. Secondary objectives include assessing its acceptability and feasibility; exploring potential impact on well-being; identifying potential adverse effects; and informing choice of outcome measures for potential future evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single arm, mixed-methods, multisite, longitudinal study. Up to 40 people living with a terminal illness under the care of hospices in England and Scotland will receive the online LIO intervention. LIO consists of 3, self-guided expression sessions over 2 weeks. The primary outcome measures are (1) a structured feedback form completed by participants after the final expression session; and (2) semi-structured interviews and focus groups with &#8804;15 patient participants, &#8804;30 hospice staff and &#8804;15 informal carers. These quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated via process evaluation to inform optimisation of the intervention design. Secondary outcome measures include validated measures of physical and psychological health collected at baseline and after the final expression session (immediately, 1, 4 and 8 weeks after); and data on recruitment, retention and fidelity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15281/002). The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, and traditional, online and social media platforms.","output":"Let It Out (LIO) study: protocol for a mixed-methods study to optimise the design and assess the feasibility of an online emotional disclosure-based intervention in UK hospices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinicians around the world are experiencing skin breakdown due to the prolonged usage of masks while working long hours to treat patients with COVID-19.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) characterizations and laser granulometry were conducted. Microscopic analysis performed on polymer blend nanocomposites evidenced a localization of A200 silica in the PA11 dispersed phase and R805 silica at the PLA/PA11 interface. Frequency sweep tests on neat polymer nanocomposites revealed a pronounced gel-like behavior for PLASi5 and PA11SiR5, evidencing a high dispersion of A200 in PLA and R805 in PA11. A yield behavior was also evidenced for both PLA80Si5 and PLA80SiR5 blends.

The resulting Transmission Trees are characterized by breadth, depth and generations needed to reach a target of 50% infected from a starting population of 100, or self-extinction prior to reaching that target. Metrics reflecting efficiency of an epidemic relate closely to topology of the trees. It can be shown that the notion of superspreading individuals may be a statistical artefact of Transmission Tree growth, while superspreader events can be readily simulated with appropriate parameter settings. The potential use of contact tracing data to identify chain length and shared paths is explored as a measure of epidemic progression. This characterization of epidemics in terms of topological characteristics of Transmission Trees may complement equation-based models that work from rates of infection. By constructing measures of efficiency of spread based on Transmission Tree topology and distribution, rather than rates of infection over time, the agent-based approach may provide a method to characterize and project risks associated with collections of transmission events, most notably at relatively early epidemic stages, when rates are low and equation-based approaches are challenged in their capacity to describe or predict.","output":"CovidSIMVL -- Transmission Trees, Superspreaders and Contact Tracing in Agent Based Models of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we proposed an advanced business intelligence framework for firms in a post-pandemic phase to increase their performance and productivity.

METHODS: A cross-sectional single-centre study was conducted on 42 participants who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via an NPS within the past 7 days. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained for each test. The positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for the saliva samples and buccal swabs, and compared with NPS. RESULTS: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive by any one of the three tests. With reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7%, and OA 69.0%; the buccal swab had PPA 56.7%, NPA 100%, and OA 73.8%.

METHODS: We collected daily data of COVID-19 incidence, 8 ambient air pollutants (particulate matter of &#8804;2.5 m [PM2.5], particulate matter &#8804;10 m [PM10], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and maximum 8-h moving average concentrations for ozone [O3-8h]) and 3 meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, and wind) in China's 3 worst COVID-19-stricken cities during the study period. The multivariate Poisson regression was performed to understand their correlation. RESULTS: Daily COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with PM2.5 and humidity in all cities. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of PM2.5 for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.036 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032-1.039) in Wuhan, 1.059 (95% CI, 1.046-1.072) in Xiaogan, and 1.144 (95% CI, 1.12-1.169) in Huanggang. The RR of humidity for daily COVID-19 incidence was consistently lower than that of PM2.5, and this difference ranged from 0.027 to 0.111. Moreover, PM10 and temperature also exhibited a notable correlation with daily COVID-19 incidence, but in a negative pattern The RR of PM10 for daily COVID-19 incidence ranged from 0.915 (95% CI, 0.896-0.934) to 0.961 (95% CI, 0.95-0.972, while that of temperature ranged from 0.738 (95% CI, 0.717-0.759) to 0.969 (95% CI, 0.966-0.973).

Recent case series have reported a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and acute myocarditis, predominantly in young males. We hereby describe a previously healthy 17-year-old man, with no past cardiac history, who presented to the emergency department with persistent chest pain and fever (up to 38 C). The patient had received the first dose of Cominarty (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine 10 days before symptom onset and reported flu-like symptoms and conjunctivitis involving both eyes one week before administration of the first vaccine dose. On that occasion, no COVID test was performed and the patient was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotic eye drops. On admission, laboratory tests were performed (Troponin-I  19 500C23 270 ng/l. CRP 23 mg/dl, ESR 43 s, WBC 17 570 cell/mm(3)) as well as COVID-19 PCR, Serological tests and Autoimmune disorders panel all resulting negative. CT coronary angiogram did not reveal any spontaneous coronary artery dissection or anomalous origin of coronary arteries and Calcium Score was 0. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a depressed LVEF (36%) with concomitant posterior and inferior wall as well as posterior and anterior basal interventricular septum hypokinesia. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis with sub-endomyocardial and interstitial fibrosis. CMR was also performed (1-week after presentation) demonstrating mildly depressed systolic function (LVEF 47%), with hypokinesia of the posterior and inferior wall, increased signal intensity on T2 maps (58 ms, n.v. <55 ms), prolonged native T1 values (1083 ms, n.v. <1030 ms) as well as subepicardial and intramyocardial LGE enhancement of infero-lateral segments reflecting intercellular fibrosis. Thereafter, the patient was discharged with medical therapy including ACE-inhibitor, colchicine, and ibuprofen. Given the close proximity between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration and the absence of other predisposing conditions, the aetiology of myocarditis was attributed to the vaccine. In addition, as the patient suffered from flu-like symptoms and conjunctivitis 1 week before the vaccine, a previous paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected and anti-SARS-Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein antibody test revealed high antibody levels with low IgG avidity. Given that myocarditic symptoms evolved after complete Sars-Cov2 symptom resolution, our first hypothesis is that the infection is unlikely to be the cause of acute myocarditis in this patient. Indeed, current literature on COVID-related myocarditis reports close temporal association between respiratory symptoms and myocarditis onset. In support to our hypothesis, recent trials have reported that myocarditis more frequently occurs following administration of mRNA vaccines especially in male adolescents and young adults like our patient. However, cardiac side effects typically occur after full vaccination and symptoms appear within three days following the second dose, which does not fully apply to this case. Notwithstanding this, more recent studies have reported myocarditis even after first vaccination dose in patients with previous COVID-19 infection, analogously to the case described. This case suggests a complex interaction between immunological factors and covid infection/vaccination with potential significant implications on the cardiovascular system. From current literature, much uncertainty remains regarding time interval criteria for reliable post-vaccination myocarditis diagnosis, hence large-scale clinical trials are needed to address this issue.","output":"742 Myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: is that so simple?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) is a chronic granulomatous enteritis, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), responsible for important economic losses in the dairy industry. Current diagnostic methods have low sensitivities for detection of latent forms of MAP infection, defined by focal granulomatous lesions and scarce humoral response or MAP presence. In contrast, patent infections correspond to multifocal and diffuse types of enteritis where there is increased antibody production, and substantial mycobacterial load. Our previous RNA-Seq analysis allowed the selection of five candidate biomarkers overexpressed in peripheral blood of MAP infected Holstein cows with focal (ABCA13 and MMP8) and diffuse (FAM84A, SPARC and DES) lesions vs. control animals with no detectable PTB-associated lesions in intestine and regional lymph nodes. The aim of the current study was to assess the PTB diagnostic potential of commercial ELISAs designed for the specific detection of these biomarkers. The ability of these ELISAs to identify animals with latent and/or patent forms of MAP infection was investigated using serum from naturally infected cattle (n = 88) and non-infected control animals (n = 67). ROC analysis revealed that the ABCA13-based ELISA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of infected animals with focal lesions (AUC 0.837, sensitivity 79.25% and specificity 88.06%) and with any type of histological lesion (AUC 0.793, sensitivity 69.41% and specificity 86.57%) improving on the diagnostic performance of the popular IDEXX ELISA and other conventional diagnostic methods. SPARC and MMP8 showed the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of animals with multifocal (AUC 0.852) and diffuse lesions (AUC 0.831), respectively.

Morphologically, HGEC includes high-grade endometrioid carcinoma, serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, undifferentiated/dedifferentiated carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma. The morphologic classification has been used for prognostication and treatment decisions. However, patient management based on morphologic classification is limited by suboptimal interobserver reproducibility, variable clinical outcomes observed within the same histotype, and frequent discordant histotyping/grading between biopsy and hysterectomy specimens. Recent studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network established four distinct molecular subtypes: POLE-ultramutated, microsatellite unstable, copy number high, and copy number low groups. Compared to histotyping, the TCGA molecular classification appears superior in risk stratification. The best prognosis is seen in the POLE-ultramutated group and the worst in copy number high group, while the prognosis in the microsatellite unstable and copy number low groups is in between. The TCGA subtyping is more reproducible and shows a better concordance between endometrial biopsy and resection specimens.

METHODS: Systematic review (SR) and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of MedRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCTs outcomes since SR search completion. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (out of 2,119 database records) and 117 RCTs (out of 5565 RCTs in the registries) meeting inclusion criteria.

The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, anti(retro)virals, or use of vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work, there is little evidence regarding other compounds with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing.

However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care. We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach. Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis. We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers. In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated. Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized. In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care. Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong. Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1% of gross domestic product. Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed. Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards UHC in the decade to 2030.","output":"Measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 epidemic is one of the major health problems all over the world due to its amazing spreading power and potential damage.

Optional Medicaid services like podiatry are often subject to cost-cutting measures in periods of economic downturn, as was the case in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis. Although the cuts were intended as a cost-saving measure, research indicates they had the opposite effect. The restriction and limitation of these services during the Great Recession resulted in both poorer health outcomes for beneficiaries, and poorer financial outcomes for state Medicaid programs. With states citing record levels of unemployment as of April 2020 and projecting significant declines in annual revenue in 2021, the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to rival those of the Great Recession. Given the historical precedent for restricting or eliminating optional Medicaid services as a cost-saving measure, it is likely that podiatric services will once again come under scrutiny. Previous efforts by state-level podiatric societies have proven successful in lobbying for the reinstatement of coverage under Medicaid by conveying evidence of the negative outcomes associated with elimination to stakeholders.

Based on a review of 90 wildlife laws in 8 high-biodiversity countries with different legal systems, we developed a taxonomy that describes all types of wildlife offenses in those countries. The 511 offenses are organized into a hierarchical taxonomy that scholars and practitioners can use to help conduct legal analyses. This is significant amidst competing calls to strengthen, deregulate and reform wildlife legislation, particularly in response to fears over zoonotic threats and large-scale biodiversity loss. It can be used to provide more nuance legal analyses, and facilitate like-for-like comparisons across countries, informing processes to redraft conservation laws, review deregulation efforts, close loopholes, harmonize legislation across jurisdictions. For example, we apply the taxonomy to compare how 8 countries sanction the offense of \\"hunting a protected species\\", to explore different scales and approaches to imposing fines and imprisonment.

Materials and Methods: Serum BDNF and selenium levels were determined in 40 male elite athletes before and after vigorous exercise (training match) with a probability of exposure to blows and in 10 sedentary men subjected to exercise (Astrand running protocol). Results: Serum BDNF levels were found 11.50  3.50 ng/mL before exercise and 14.02  3.15 ng/mL after exercise in the athlete group (p = 0.02), and 12.18  4.55 ng/ mL and 11.74  2.48 ng/ mL before and after exercise in the sedentary group, respectively (p = 0.873). Serum BDNF (pre-exercise, baseline) levels were slightly lower in the athlete group than those in the sedentary group (11.50  3.50 and 12.18  4.55 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.796). Pre-exercise serum selenium levels in athletes were significantly higher compared to those of sedentary participants (130.53  36.79 and 95.51  20.57 g/L, respectively, p = 0.011). There was no difference in selenium levels after exercise (124.01  29.96 g/L) compared to pre-exercise (130.53  36.79 g/L) in the athlete group (p = 0.386).

Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested.

In this study, we aimed to explore the potential roles and molecular mechanisms of action of ADSCs in histone-induced endothelial damage. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 N mice were intravenously injected with ADSCs, followed by histones or a vehicle. The mice in each group were assessed for survival, pulmonary vascular permeability, and histological changes. A co-culture model with primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to histones was used to clarify the paracrine effect of ADSCs. Overexpression and inhibition of miR-126 ADSCs were also examined as causative factors for endothelial protection. RESULTS: The administration of ADSCs markedly improved survival, inhibited histone-mediated lung hemorrhage and edema, and attenuated vascular hyper-permeability in mice. ADSCs were engrafted in the injured lung and attenuated histone-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. ADSCs showed endothelial protection (via a paracrine effect) and Akt phosphorylation in the histone-exposed HUVECs. Notably, increased Akt phosphorylation by ADSCs was mostly mediated by exosomes in histone-induced cytotoxicity and lung damage. Moreover, the expression of miR-126 was increased in exosomes from histone-exposed ADSCs. Remarkably, the inhibition of miR-126 in ADSCs failed to increase Akt phosphorylation in histone-exposed HUVECs.

Most efforts worldwide by the scientific community and commercial companies focus on the formulation of protocols for SARS CoV-2 analysis in wastewater and approaches addressing the quantitative relationship between WBE and medical surveillance are lacking. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed which uses as input the number of daily positive medical tests together with the highly non-linear shedding rate curve of individuals to estimate the evolution of virus shedding rate in wastewater along calendar days. A comprehensive parametric study by the model using as input actual medical surveillance and WBE data for the city of Thessaloniki ([~]700,000 inhabitants, North Greece) during the outbreak of November 2020 reveals the conditions under which WBE can be used as an early warning tool for predicting pandemic outbreaks. It is shown that early warning capacity is different along the days of an outbreak and depends strongly on the number of days apart between the day of maximum shedding rate of infected individuals in their disease cycle and the day of their medical testing. The present data indicate for Thessaloniki an average early warning capacity of around 2 days. Moreover, the data imply that there exists a proportion between unreported cases (asymptomatic persons with mild symptoms that do not seek medical advice) and reported cases.

In the absence of effective antiviral and limited medical resources, many measures are recommended by WHO to control the infection rate and avoid exhausting the limited medical resources. Wearing a mask is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention measures that can be used to cut the primary source of SARS-CoV2 droplets expelled by an infected individual. Regardless of discourse on medical resources and diversities in masks, all countries are mandating coverings over the nose and mouth in public. To contribute towards communal health, this paper aims to devise a highly accurate and real-time technique that can efficiently detect non-mask faces in public and thus, enforcing to wear mask. The proposed technique is ensemble of one-stage and two-stage detectors to achieve low inference time and high accuracy. We start with ResNet50 as a baseline and applied the concept of transfer learning to fuse high-level semantic information in multiple feature maps. In addition, we also propose a bounding box transformation to improve localization performance during mask detection. The experiment is conducted with three popular baseline models viz. ResNet50, AlexNet and MobileNet. We explored the possibility of these models to plug-in with the proposed model so that highly accurate results can be achieved in less inference time. It is observed that the proposed technique achieves high accuracy (98.2%) when implemented with ResNet50. Besides, the proposed model generates 11.07% and 6.44% higher precision and recall in mask detection when compared to the recent public baseline model published as RetinaFaceMask detector.

Methods Patients with T2DM with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and admitted between January 21, 2020, and January 31, 2021 in Hong Kong were identified in our cohort. Exposure was defined as metformin use within 90 days prior to admission until hospital discharge for COVID-19. Primary outcome was defined as clinical improvement of 1 point on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (CPS). Other outcomes were hospital discharge, recovery, in-hospital death, acidosis, hyperinflammatory syndrome, length of hospitalization, and changes in WHO CPS score. Results Metformin use was associated with greater odds of clinical improvement (OR = 2.74, p = 0.009), hospital discharge (OR = 2.26, p = 0.009), and recovery (OR = 2.54, p = 0.005), in addition to lower odds of hyperinflammatory syndrome (OR = 0.71, p = 0.021) and death (OR = 0.41, p = 0.010) than control. Patients on metformin treatment had a shorter hospital stay (?2.76 days, p = 0.017) than their control counterparts. The average WHO CPS scores were significantly lower in metformin users than non-users since day 15 (p < 0.001). However, metformin use was associated with higher odds of acidosis.

Higher mortality has been reported in minorities with different cancer types despite adjusting for income or education. In hematological malignancies the trend persists. Despite favorable prognostic factors upon diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia, the mortality risk for Latinos and African Americans is higher by 12% and 7%, respectively. Both incidence and mortality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are highest in Latinos. In Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Latino and African American adolescents and young adults have a higher risk of death at 35% and 62%, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the immense disparities in healthcare outcomes in minority communities. Disproportionate rates of hospitalization and death related to COVID-19 have been reported across the nation, highlighting the stark consequences of historic racial and economic injustices. With these findings comes a call to action and an urgency to create systemic change to promote health equity. Methods: Patients hospitalized at any Scripps Health hospital in San Diego County from March 1, 2020 to July 30, 2020 with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and blood type were included in the analysis (n = 316). Demographic, laboratory and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record and included age, ethnicity, BMI, sex, medications, co-morbidities, blood type, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelets, ESR, CRP and D-dimer. Outcomes of interest included length of say (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation and mortality. Analysis was performed with an a priori predictor of Latin American ethnicity. Linear regression analysis of LOS, logistic regression of other variables and age-adjusted regression was done. Demographic characteristics that were predictive in univariate analysis with p< 0.1 were included in a multiple regression model for each outcome with Latin American ethnicity as a predictor. If the potentially predictive demographic characteristic maintained trends toward significance (p<0.1), the predictor was retained in the model to produce the final regression results for each outcome. Results: Hospitalized COVID patients were predominantly male, obese (BMI 30.6) and average age was 63 years. 69.3% of patients were Hispanic. 65.51% of patients were diabetic, 26.27% had chronic kidney disease and 23.10% had congestive heart failure. Additional patient characteristics are included in Table 1. Median length of hospital stay was 16.5 days, 59% were admitted to the ICU, 37% were intubated, and 27% died. Blood type was not found to be a predictor of outcomes. The odds ratio (OR) of age adjusted LOS for Latinos was 1.01 days (p-value 0.60), 1.06 for ICU admission (p-value 0.80) and 0.82 for death (p-value 0.50). After adjusting for age and other potentially predictive characteristics, Hispanic ethnicity was not predictive of poor outcomes. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in San Diego County, there was a strikingly high rate of hospitalizations in Latino patients. While the 2019 United States Census estimates the Latino population in San Diego to be 34.1%, Latinos comprised nearly 70% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Scripps Health system. Despite the high rate of admissions in Latino patients, Latin American ethnicity was not a predictor of poor outcomes as previously reported in other populations. The underlying etiology of the high rates of COVID-19 hospital admission in Latinos is likely multifactorial due to overcrowding, lack of access to healthcare and higher prevalence of chronic illness as demonstrated by our cohort's increased incidence of co-morbid conditions.

Methods Patients aged >18 years who were diagnosed with ACS in the emergency department were included in this study, which was planned as a cross-sectional study. Patients were divided into two groups of patients with high and low SSs according to coronary angiography results. Demographic and laboratory parameters were compared between the groups. Results Our study consisted of 78 patients diagnosed with ACS, who met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the study group was 59 years, and 67.9% of the patients were male. 21 patients (26.9%) had high SSs and 57 patients (73.1%) had low SSs. Mean IG% was significantly higher in high SS group compared to low SS group (0.710.25 vs 0.440.21 mg/dl, p<0.001). IG% can present a high SS with 76.2% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity at a cut-off value of 0.7. Conclusion IG was significantly higher in ACS patients with high SSs.

Univariate analysis was performed to assess predictors of good clinical outcome, as defined by 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores 2. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine the impact of placement to an IRF versus an SNF on clinical outcomes. RESULTS 147 subjects were included in the analysis with a mean age of 6314 years and median NIHSS of 18 (IQR 14-21). Final infarct volumes, and modified APACHE II, THRIVE, and HIAT-2 scores were similar between those discharged to an IRF and those discharged to an SNF.However, their 90 day outcomes were significantly different, with far fewer patients at SNFs achieving good clinical outcomes (25% vs 46%; p=0.023). Disposition to SNF was significantly associated with a lower probability of achieving an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (OR = 0.337 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.94); p<0.04). CONCLUSIONS Subjects discharged to SNFs and IRFs after thrombectomy have similar medical and neurological severity at admission and similar final infarct volumes at discharge.

Objective The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about pharmacist- ordered and administered COVID-19 testing. Methods A 13-item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an active license in Rhode Island. Results One hundred and twenty-two pharmacists (13.8%) consented and responded to at least one question of the survey. The results indicated that the primary concern of pharmacists in regard to performing COVID-19 testing was spreading the infection to family members (71.3%). Becoming personally infected (59.8%) and not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (62.3%) were the second and third most common concern of pharmacists. Almost all pharmacists (99.9%) responded that they would be willing to take part in the testing process if they had appropriate PPE. Forty-six percent of pharmacists expressed concern regarding reimbursement for their company while 56% of pharmacists requested personal compensation for this service.

Accreditation Council for Medical Education (ACGME) subcompetencies are scored on a 5-point scale and span six domains: patient care (PC), medical knowledge, systems-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills (ICS). Summative assessments of the 23 PEM subcompetencies are assigned by each program's clinical competency committee and submitted semiannually for each fellow. Program directors voluntarily provided deidentified ACGME milestone reports. Demographics including sex, program region, and type of residency were collected. Descriptive analysis of milestones was performed for each year of fellowship. Multivariate analyses evaluated the difference in scores by sex for each of the subcompetencies. Results Forty-eight geographically diverse programs participated, yielding data for 639 fellows (66% of all PEM fellows nationally); sex was recorded for 604 fellows, of whom 67% were female. When comparing the mean milestone scores in each of the six domains, there were no differences by sex in any year of training.

Yet no successful vaccine or treatment has been reported. Even though increasing the practice of the community is critical to prevent coronavirus disease 19 pandemic, there is limited study in Ethiopia particularly in the study area. Therefore, the study aimed to assess practice and associated factors toward coronavirus disease 19. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and associated factors with practice toward coronavirus disease 19 prevention in Adigrat residents, Northern Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was carried out among 421 Adigrat Town residents from September 10 to 20, 2020. Households were selected using systematic sampling technique. To identify determinant factors, binary logistic regression analyses were employed with confidence interval of 95%. To identify statistically signi?cant factors, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was used. Statisticalsigni?cance was determined at P-value <0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of poor practice was 32.2% (95% CI (31.5C38.5%)). Age of 20C29 (AOR=2.1, 95% CI (1.9C6.5)), occupational status of unemployed (AOR=1.5, CI 95% (1.4C1.9)), marital status of unmarried (AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.2C12.5)), and educational status of cannot read and write (AOR=2.1, 95% CI (2.0C9.3)) were statistically signi?cant factors toward COVID-19 prevention.

This systematic review is intended to summarize classic and recent literature investigating near work and the onset and progression of myopia, potential mechanisms and pertinent clinical recommendations. The impact of electronic device use is considered. PubMed and Medline were used to find peer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies related to near work and myopia from 1980 to July 2020 using the PRISMA checklist. Studies were chosen using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist, with a focus on studies with a sample size greater than 50. Studies were independently evaluated; conclusions were drawn per these evaluations. Numerous cross-sectional studies found increased odds ratio of myopia with increased near work. While early longitudinal studies failed to find this relationship, more recent longitudinal studies have found a relationship between myopia and near work. Rather than daily duration of near work, interest has increased regarding absolute working distance and duration of continuous near viewing. Several reports have found that shorter working distances (<30 cm) and continuous near-work activity (>30 min) are risk factors for myopia onset and progression. Novel objective continuously measuring rangefinding devices have been developed to better address these questions. The literature is conflicting, likely due to the subjective and variable nature in which near work has been quantified and a paucity of longitudinal studies. We conclude that more precise objective measures of near viewing behaviour are necessary to make definitive conclusions regarding the relationship between myopia and near work. Focus should shift to utilizing objective and continuously measuring instruments to quantify near-work behaviours in children, followed longitudinally, to understand the complex factors related to near work.

In our case, the differential diagnosis of meningocele was made with the cystic compound of a sacrococcygeal teratoma, which represents one of the most common congenital tumors in newborns. The particularity of this case was that a neural tube defect occurred despite the prophylactic administration of folic acid during pregnancy, which represents a well-documented protection against neural tube defects in fetuses.","output":"Early prenatal diagnosis of an atypical phenotype of sacral spina bifida"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rDNA clusters and flanking sequences on human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22 represent large gaps in the current genomic assembly. The organization and the degree of divergence of the human rDNA units within an individual nucleolar organizer region (NOR) are only partially known. To address this lacuna, we previously applied transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning to isolate individual rDNA units from chromosome 21. That approach revealed an unexpectedly high level of heterogeneity in human rDNA, raising the possibility of corresponding variations in ribosome dynamics. We have now applied the same strategy to analyze an entire rDNA array end-to-end from a copy of chromosome 22. Sequencing of TAR isolates provided the entire NOR sequence, including proximal and distal junctions that may be involved in nucleolar function. Comparison of the newly sequenced rDNAs to reference sequence for chromosomes 22 and 21 revealed variants that are shared in human rDNA in individuals from different ethnic groups, many of them at high frequency. Analysis infers comparable intra- and inter-individual divergence of rDNA units on the same and different chromosomes, supporting the concerted evolution of rDNA units. The results provide a route to investigate further the role of rDNA variation in nucleolar formation and in the empirical associations of nucleoli with pathology.","output":"The genomic structure of a human chromosome 22 nucleolar organizer region determined by TAR cloning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a new viral respiratory infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, China. COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a similar virus to those involved in other epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 frequently affects young adults of reproductive age and that the elderly and patients with chronic disease have high mortality rates. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and breastfeeding. Most COVID-19 cases present with mild flu-like symptoms and only require treatment with symptomatic relief medications, whereas other cases with COVID-19 require treatment in an intensive care unit. There is currently no specific effective treatment for COVID-19. A large number of drugs are being used to fight infection by SARS-CoV-2. Experience with this therapeutic arsenal has been gained over the years in the treatment of other viral, autoimmune, parasitic, and bacterial diseases. Importantly, the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19 cannot expose pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to the potential teratogenic risks of these drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and understand the safety of anti-COVID-19 therapies prior to conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.","output":"COVID-19 Treatment: Drug Safety Prior to Conception and During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though opportunities exist to improve antibiotic prescribing across the care spectrum, discharge from acute hospitalization is an increasingly recognized source of antibiotic overuse.

Barriers to discharge antibiotic stewardship include the perceived high stakes of care transitions during which patients move from intense to infrequent observation, difficulties in antibiotic measurement to guide improvement at discharge, and poor communication across silos, particularly with skilled nursing facilities.

To enhance human-robot interaction, it is essential for robots to become more socialised via processing multiple social cues in a complex real-world environment. For this aim, our study adopted the neurorobotic paradigm of gaze-triggered audio-visual crossmodal conflict resolution to make an iCub robot express human-like social attention responses. For the human study, a behavioural experiment was conducted on 37 participants. To improve ecological validity, we designed a round-table meeting scenario with three animated avatars. Each avatar wore a medical mask to cover facial cues of the nose, mouth, and jaw. The central avatar was capable of gaze shifting, while the peripheral two were capable of sound generation. The gaze direction and the sound localisation were either congruent or incongruent. We observed that the central avatar's dynamic gaze could trigger crossmodal social attention with better human performance in the audio-visual congruent condition than in the incongruent condition. For the robot study, our saliency prediction model was trained to implement social cue detection, audio-visual saliency prediction, and selective attention. After finishing the model training, the iCub robot was exposed to similar laboratory conditions as the participants. While the human performance was overall superior, our trained model demonstrates that it can replicate similar attention responses as humans regarding the congruency and incongruency performance.","output":"A trained humanoid robot can perform human-like crossmodal social attention and conflict resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intestinal barrier plays an extremely important role in maintaining the immune homeostasis of the gut and the entire body. It is made up of an intricate system of cells, mucus and intestinal microbiota. A complex system of proteins allows the selective permeability of elements that are safe and necessary for the proper nutrition of the body. Disturbances in the tightness of this barrier result in the penetration of toxins and other harmful antigens into the system. Such events lead to various digestive tract dysfunctions, systemic infections, food intolerances and autoimmune diseases. Pathogenic and probiotic bacteria, and the compounds they secrete, undoubtedly affect the properties of the intestinal barrier. The discovery of zonulin, a protein with tight junction regulatory activity in the epithelia, sheds new light on the understanding of the role of the gut barrier in promoting health, as well as the formation of diseases. Coincidentally, there is an increasing number of reports on treatment methods that target gut microbiota, which suggests that the prevention of gut-barrier defects may be a viable approach for improving the condition of COVID-19 patients.

Drug reactions represent a significant burden to the healthcare system due to increased hospital stay durations and associated costs. Moreover, some of these reactions may be life-threatening. The most common clinical manifestation of a CADR is a maculopapular drug eruption (MDE). Due to its many clinical mimics and associations with a variety of histopathologic patterns, maculopapular drug eruption is difficult to definitively diagnose from both a clinical and histopathological perspective. SUMMARY: We reviewed the clinical and histopathologic features of 327 cases of MDE from several studies in the literature and summarized characteristic histopathologic findings and their frequencies of occurrence. We found that the most common and suggestive histopathologic features of MDE were epidermal spongiosis, lymphocytic infiltrate, and occasional necrotic keratinocytes; interface change at the DEJ; superficial perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate with or without eosinophils and neutrophils in the mid-to-deep dermis and mild papillary dermal edema; and dilation of superficial vessels. The presence of multiple histopathologic patterns within the same tissue specimen is also suggestive of MDE. This review and analysis suggest that a biopsy may improve the diagnostic accuracy by both establishing common and uncommon features associated with MDE and reviewing features that help to exclude other causes of maculopapular eruption. KEY MESSAGE: Histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of MDE, while not entirely specific, may aid in establishing a differential that includes a drug eruption. Thus, a biopsy can be a helpful diagnostic tool when MDE is suspected by demonstrating findings suggestive of MDE or by ruling out clinical mimics. However, biopsy results cannot be used in isolation as clinical-pathologic correlation is paramount in MDE.","output":"Histopathologic Features of Maculopapular Drug Eruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The predominant pulmonary imaging findings on chest CT in the novel 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) are bilateral ground glass opacities.

The European Hernia Society therefore implemented a Clinical Practice Guideline development project. METHODS The guidelines development group consisted of general, hernia and colorectal surgeons, a biostatistician and a biologist, from 14 European countries. These guidelines conformed to the AGREE II standards and the GRADE methodology. The databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and the gray literature through OpenGrey were searched. Quality assessment was performed using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists. The guidelines were presented at the 38th European Hernia Society Congress and each key question was evaluated in a consensus voting of congress participants. RESULTS End colostomy is associated with a higher incidence of parastomal hernia, compared to other types of stomas. Clinical examination is necessary for the diagnosis of parastomal hernia, whereas computed tomography scan or ultrasonography may be performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Currently available classifications are not validated; however, we suggest the use of the European Hernia Society classification for uniform research reporting. There is insufficient evidence on the policy of watchful waiting, the route and location of stoma construction, and the size of the aperture. The use of a prophylactic synthetic non-absorbable mesh upon construction of an end colostomy is strongly recommended. No such recommendation can be made for other types of stomas at present. It is strongly recommended to avoid performing a suture repair for elective parastomal hernia. So far, there is no sufficient comparative evidence on specific techniques, open or laparoscopic surgery and specific mesh types. However, a mesh without a hole is suggested in preference to a keyhole mesh when laparoscopic repair is performed. CONCLUSION An evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of parastomal hernias reveals the lack of evidence on several topics, which need to be addressed by multicenter trials. Parastomal hernia prevention using a prophylactic mesh for end colostomies reduces parastomal herniation.

In addition to the standard influence of numerical distance, a significant predictor of performance was the degree of physical similarity between the probe and the standard as depicted in Mandarin. Additionally, competing effects of physical similarity, defined in terms of the Arabic number format, were also found. Critically the size of these different effects of physical similarity varied systematically across individuals such that larger effects of one compensated for smaller effects of the other. It is argued that the data favor accounts of processing that assume that different number formats access different format-specific representations of quantities. Moreover, for Chinese participants the default is to translate numerals into a Mandarin format prior to accessing quantity information.

Information technology offers an opportunity to more closely engage patients with chronic HIV infection in their long-term management and support a focus on HRQL. However, the implementation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, such as HRQL in routine care, is challenged by the need to synthesize data generated by questionnaires, the complexity of collecting data between patient visits, and the integration of results into clinical decision-making processes. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to design and pilot-test a multimedia software platform to overcome these challenges and provide a vehicle to increase focus on HRQL issues in HIV management. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team in France and Australia conducted the study with 120 patients and 16 doctors contributing to the design and development of the software. We used agile development principles, user-centered design, and qualitative research methods to develop and pilot the software platform. We developed a prototype application to determine the acceptability of the software and piloted the final version with 41 Australian and 19 French residents using 2 validated electronic questionnaires, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items, and the Patient Reported Outcomes Quality of Life-HIV. RESULTS: Testing of the prototype demonstrated that patients wanted an application that was intuitive and without excessive instruction, so it felt effortless to use, as well as secure and discreet. Clinicians wanted the PRO data synthesized, presented clearly and succinctly, and clinically actionable. Safety concerns for patients and clinicians included confidentiality, and the potential for breakdown in communication if insufficient user training was not provided. The final product, piloted with patients from both countries, showed that most respondents found the application easy to use and comprehend. The usability testing survey administered found that older Australians had reduced scores for understanding the visual interface (P=.004) and finding the buttons organized (P=.02). Three-fourths of the respondents were concerned with confidentiality (P=.007), and this result was more prevalent in participants with higher anxiety and stress scores (P=.01), as measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items. These statistical associations were not observed in 15 French patients who completed the same questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Digital applications in health care should be safe and fit for purpose. Our software was acceptable to patients and shows potential to overcome some barriers to the implementation of PROs in routine care. The design of the clinicians interface presents a solution to the problem of voluminous data, both synthesizing and providing a snapshot of longitudinal data.

Some participants perceived that learning SF would help them have a good quality of life through informing actions to maintain physical health or leading to psychological benefits such as emotional preparation for disease. Other participants preferred not to learn SF because results could ruin your quality of life, such as by causing negative psychological impacts. Measuring health-related and non-health-related quality of life may capture outcomes related to clinical and personal utility of GS and SF, which have previously been challenging to measure.

METHODS: A retrospective analytical cross-sectional study was performed in our hospital, analyzing medical charts of all children under 2 years of age with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis admitted to our ED in the last years. Demographics and clinical data of patients affected with acute bronchiolitis during the 2020-2021 season-COVID-19 outbreak-were compared to those of the 5 previous years. RESULTS: We observed an average drop of 84% of the rate of acute bronchiolitis managed by pediatricians in ED in 2020-2021 compared with bronchiolitis seasons of 5 previous years. We also reported, during the COVID-19 outbreak, a higher number of children affected by acute bronchiolitis referred to ED as Emergency Consultations who required hospitalization. Regarding etiological agents, no differences in respiratory virus circulation, especially RSV, were observed in the two groups.

Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005). The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009). Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals.

Past studies of dog lifespan have used academic, corporate or insurance data. While independent primary care data exist for the UK, none have as of yet been published for the US. This study analyzed data from three independent primary care US veterinary hospitals and identified factors that influence lifespan and mortality in a cohort of n = 20,970 privately owned dogs using Kaplan-Meier survival estimators and Cox Proportional Hazards modelling, including body size as a covariate. RESULTS: As previously reported, body size was negatively correlated with lifespan. Gonadectomy was associated with a longer lifespan, with the effect being stronger in females than in males. This lifespan advantage was conserved in gonadectomized female dogs that lived to at least ages 5 and 8 years. We did not find significant differences in lifespan between purebred and mixed breed dogs; however, breeds with larger effective population sizes and/or lower inbreeding coefficients had median survival times 3C6 months longer than breeds with smaller effective population sizes or higher inbreeding coefficients, indicating that these measures of genetic diversity may be affecting breed lifespans. We also found that dog breeds belonging to the Mountain ancestral group had median survival times that were 3.5C4.6 years shorter than other purebred dog groups, which remained significant even when correcting for body size. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that it is possible to obtain and analyze data from independent veterinary clinics in the US, an approach that could be useful for studies of comparative epidemiology under the One Health and One Welfare paradigms. We also show that the lifespan effects of gonadectomy are not identical between the sexes and should be investigated separately by sex in future analyses. More research is needed to further clarify the influence of age at gonadectomy, as well as the factors leading to the observed differences in lifespan in the Mountain ancestral group and in dog breeds of varying inbreeding coefficients and effective population sizes.","output":"Lifespan of companion dogs seen in three independent primary care veterinary clinics in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundLarge outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant have occurred in countries with high coverage of inactivated Covid-19 vaccines, raising urgent questions about effectiveness of these vaccines against disease and hospitalization with Omicron.

To measure the exact infection rate, we initiated a study that aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 864 individuals were enrolled in the study, including 432 patients with IBD (290 with Crohn disease and 142 with ulcerative colitis) and 432 controls without IBD (healthcare professionals) matched for age and sex. Serum samples were prospectively collected, and the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM + IgA antibodies were measured using the enzyme-linked immunoassay method (Vircell Microbiologists). RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of positive results for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, both in the IgG and IgM + IgA class, was found in patients with IBD (4.6% and 6%, respectively, compared with 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively, in controls; both P values <0.05).

Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species.

Pathogens are the aggressors, and the host immune system is responsible for the defence. However, immune responses can also become destructive, and excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections (acute pyelonephritis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and painful infections of the urinary bladder (acute cystitis) can become debilitating in susceptible patients. Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is the use of bacterial molecules that reprogramme the innate immune system, accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response and avoid severe disease.

Here, we show that the majority of COVID-19-convalescent individuals maintained SARS-CoV-2 spike S1- and S2-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, and that some of the antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or both pseudotyped viruses. Convalescent individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 showed higher neutralizing antibody titres, a faster increase in lymphocyte counts and a higher frequency of CXCR3+ T follicular help (TFH) cells compared with COVID-19-convalescent individuals who experienced non-severe disease. Circulating TFH cells were spike specific and functional, and the frequencies of CXCR3+ TFH cells were positively associated with neutralizing antibody titres in COVID-19-convalescent individuals. No individuals had detectable autoantibodies. These findings provide insights into neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals and facilitate the treatment and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Spike-specific circulating T follicular helper cell and cross-neutralizing antibody responses in COVID-19-convalescent individuals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In contrast to conventional 2-dimensional (2D) NAND flash memory, in 3D NAND flash memory, cell-to-cell interference stemming from parasitic capacitance between the word-lines (WLs) is difficult to control because the number of WLs, achieved for better packing density, have been dramatically increased under limited height of NAND string.

In humans, a new class of direct oral acting anticoagulants (DOAC) appear as effective as heparin, while eliminating the need for daily injections. Our study in horses evaluated apixaban, a newly approved DOAC for human thromboprophylaxis targeting activated factor X (Xa). Our goals were to: (1) Determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban after oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administration in horses; (2) Detect any inhibitory effects of apixaban on ex vivo Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)-induced platelet activation, and (3) Compare an anti-Xa bioactivity assay with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) for measuring apixaban concentrations. In a blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study, five horses received a single dose (0.2 mg/kg) of apixaban or placebo PO or IV. Blood was collected before and at 3 (IV) or 15 (PO) min, 30 and 45 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after dosing for measuring apixaban UPLC-MS concentrations and anti-Xa activity. Pharmacodynamic response was measured in a dilute prothrombin time (dPT) assay. Flow cytometric EHV-1-induced platelet P-selectin expression and clinical pathologic safety testing were performed at baseline, 2 and 24 h and baseline and 24 h, respectively. We found no detectable apixaban in plasma PO administration. After IV administration, plasma apixaban levels followed a two-compartment model, with concentrations peaking at 3 min and decreasing to undetectable levels by 8 h. The elimination half-life was 1.3  0.2 h, with high protein binding (92-99%). The dPT showed no relationship to apixaban UPLC-MS concentration and apixaban did not inhibit EHV-1-induced platelet activation after IV dosing. Apixaban anti-Xa activity showed excellent correlation to UPLC-MS (r 2 = 0.9997).

METHODS Participants with MS(N=15) were randomly assigned into intervention(n=8) or waitlist control(n=7) conditions. The physical activity intervention was delivered over a 16-week period and outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediately following the 16-week period in both conditions. RESULTS There was a significant, positive effect of the intervention on overall RLS severity (p=.01;Ǧ2=.43), severity during the night(p=.03,Ǧ2=.35), severity during the day while resting(p=.01,Ǧ2=.44), and severity during the day while active(p<.01,Ǧ2=.61), and non-significant improvements in RLS severity while falling asleep (p=.33,Ǧ2=.09). There were significant positive effects on sleep satisfaction(p<.01,Ǧ2=.49) and non-significant improvements in self-reported global sleep quality(p=.35,Ǧ2=.08). There was a significant intervention effect on self-reported time in bed(p=.03,Ǧ2=.37) and total sleep time(p=.03,Ǧ2=.36), and non-significant improvements in self-reported sleep latency (p=.08,Ǧ2=.25), sleep efficiency(p=.27,Ǧ2=.11), and daytime sleepiness (p=.52,Ǧ2=.04;p=.35,Ǧ2=.08;p=.51,Ǧ2=.04).

Emerging data suggest a possible role for vaccination as an adjuvant treatment for individuals with HPV-related clinical disease. Objective To systematically review the literature regarding HPV vaccination for secondary disease prevention after treatment of active clinical disease across disease sites to serve as a platform for the management of HPV-related disease of the head and neck. Evidence Review A systematic search from August 3 to 21, 2015, of the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Biosis Citation Index, Current Contents Connect, Scientific Library Online, and Global Health databases used PRISMA guidelines to identify 326 relevant articles related to adjuvant use of HPV vaccination. Primary search terms were (HPV vaccine OR human papillomavirus vaccine OR papillomarvirus vaccines OR alphapapillomavirus vaccine) AND (HPV OR human papillomavirus OR alphapapillomavirus OR papillomaviridae OR virus warts OR wart virus) AND (recurrence OR relapse OR reoccurrence OR recurrences OR relapses OR relapsing). Forty-five full texts in English were reviewed, with 19 articles included in the final review. In some studies, subpopulations of individuals with HPV DNA positivity and/or seropositivity were extracted for inclusion. Included studies were assessed for bias and separated based on the presence of active clinical disease or HPV DNA positivity or seropositivity. Findings Nineteen studies with 22 474 unique patients were included in the review. When HPV vaccination was used as an adjuvant treatment for active clinical disease, 9 of 12 studies reported decreased disease recurrence, decreased disease burden, or increased intersurgical interval. In contrast, none of the 7 studies of vaccination in individuals with HPV DNA positivity and/or seropositivity without clinical disease reported improved outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance Differences between adjuvant vaccination in HPV-mediated clinical disease and vaccination in HPV DNA-positive and/or HPV-seropositive populations posit underlying differences in disease and immune processes. These data suggest that additional evaluation of adjuvant HPV vaccination in individuals with active clinical disease is warranted.","output":"Adjuvant Human Papillomavirus Vaccination for Secondary Prevention: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has affected the global economy, influencing firm and household financial decisions worldwide.

This resulted in some dramatic improvements over our original design and this can be attributed to the development of a new lipid library. We have also developed a mitochondrial targeting system based on a membrane fusion mechanism using a MITO-Porter, which can deliver nucleic acids/pDNA into the matrix of mitochondria.

Fusion involves an initial binding of the crown-like trimeric spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 to the receptor angiotensin II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the permissive host cellular membrane and a prefusion to post-fusion conversion of the spike trimer. During this conversion, the fusion peptides of the spike trimer are inserted into the host membrane to bring together the host and viral membranes for membrane fusion in highly choreographic events. However, geometric constraints due to interactions with the membranes remain poorly understood. In this study, we build structural models of super-complexes of spike trimer/ACE2 dimers based on the molecular structures of the ACE2/neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT heterodimer. We determine the conformational constraints due to the membrane geometry on the enzymatic activity of ACE2 and on the viral fusion process.

Prenatal screening is essential for detecting and managing pre-eclampsia. However, pre-eclampsia screening is solely based on maternal risk factors and has low (< 5% in the USA) detection rates. This review looks at pre-eclampsia from engineering, public health, and medical points of view. First, pre-eclampsia is defined clinically, and the biological basis of established risk factors is described. The multiple theories behind pre-eclampsia etiology should serve as the scientific basis behind established risk factors for pre-eclampsia; however, African American race does not have sufficient evidence as a risk factor. We then briefly describe predictive statistical models that have been created to improve screening detection rates, which use a combination of biophysical and biochemical biomarkers, as well as aspects of patient medical history as inputs. Lastly, technologies that aid in advancing pre-eclampsia screening worldwide are explored. The review concludes with suggestions for more robust pre-eclampsia research, which includes diversifying study sites, improving biomarker analytical tools, and for researchers to consider studying patients before they become pregnant to improve pre-eclampsia detection rates. Additionally, researchers must acknowledge the systemic racism involved in using race as a risk factor and include qualitative measures in study designs to capture the effects of racism on patients. LAY SUMMARY: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder that can affect almost every organ system and complicates 2C8% of pregnancies globally. Here, we focus on the biological basis of the risk factors that have been identified for the condition. African American race currently does not have sufficient evidence as a risk factor and has been poorly studied. Current clinical methods poorly predict a patients likelihood of developing pre-eclampsia; thus, researchers have made statistical models that are briefly described in this review. Then, low-cost technologies that aid in advancing pre-eclampsia screening are discussed. The review ends with suggestions for research direction to improve pre-eclampsia screening in all settings. Overall, we suggest that the future of pre-eclampsia screening should aim to identify those at risk before they become pregnant. We also suggest that the clinical standard of assessing patient risk solely on patient characteristics needs to be reevaluated, that study locations of pre-eclampsia research need to be expanded beyond a few high-income countries, and that low-cost technologies should be developed to increase access to prenatal screening.","output":"Pre-eclampsia: a Scoping Review of Risk Factors and Suggestions for Future Research Direction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In sickle cell disease (SCD), the polymerization of deoxygenated HbS fundamentally alters the structure of the erythrocyte, producing the sickle cell that is characteristic of the disease. Clinical manifestations often perceived in patients suffering from SCD include vaso-occlusion, anemia, and hemolysis. Due to these sequelae, patients frequent the emergency room (ER), urgent care clinic, and hospital. Voxelotor, an oral medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 for the treatment of SCD, directly targets the pathophysiology of SCD by inhibiting deoxygenated HbS polymerization. Results of the Phase III HOPE trial indicate that the drug can increase hemoglobin levels and reduce markers of hemolysis as well as the incidence of worsening anemia in patients with SCD (Vichinsky et al. N Engl J Med 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic has posed several challenges for patients with SCD in 2020. Amid the pandemic, patients continued to seek out acute medical care, including care in the ER, urgent care clinics, and hospital. The aim of this study was to determine whether utilization of acute medical care differed for patients who received voxelotor before and after therapy in 2020. We also evaluated the utilization of healthcare through telemedicine platforms to facilitate access to novel therapies such as voxelotor for patients with SCD. Methods 13 patients (18 years of age as of January 1, 2020) with SCD who had begun treatment with voxelotor between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included in the initial analysis. Six patients were excluded from final analysis: three discontinued treatment due to side effects, one was noncompliant with treatment, and two were lost to follow-up. Acute care utilization, measured by the number of times each patient visited the ER, urgent care clinic, and hospital was compared for each patient in the period six months prior to their first dose of voxelotor and in the period six months after their last dose of the drug in 2020 using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests. Demographic information and the type of visit at which patients agreed to proceed with voxeletor was recorded for each patient. Simple linear regressions and multiple regressions controlled for covariates, defined as sex, BMI, age, type of insurance coverage, and duration of treatment. Results All seven (100%) patients discussed voxelotor treatment with their provider during a telehealth video visit. In the period before initiating treatment, patients frequented the ER an average of 2.71 (SD=6.75) times. In the six months after their last dose, patients visited the ER less than they had in the period prior to treatment, on average 0.57 (SD=0.79) times. This difference did not achieve statistical significance (p>0.9999). The mean number of visits to the urgent care clinic in the six months before treatment was 2.71 (SD=6.75) compared to 2 (SD=4) in the period after patients' last dose in 2020. This finding was not statistically significant (p>0.9999). Hospitalizations, on average, decreased significantly from 5.14 (SD=2.34) in the six months before starting treatment to 1.57 (SD=0.98) after ending therapy for 2020 (p=0.0015). Covariates did not have an effect on the differences in acute care utilization before treatment and after last treatment in 2020. Conclusions The findings of this study imply that treatment with voxelotor was associated with a decrease in the frequency of hospitalizations for the seven patients analyzed. This finding can potentially be attributed to the efficacy of voxelotor in improving anemia and reducing complications associated with SCD. While the difference between ER visits and urgent care visits before treatment and after the last dose in 2020 did not achieve statistical significance, likely due to small sample size, the data does suggest a reduction in both outcomes. In addition, the observation that all visits in which patient and provider discussed and initiated treatment were virtual support the use of telemedicine technology to improve access to multidisciplinary care and novel therapies for SCD patients. The impact of voxelotor treatment will continue to be assessed in SCD patients at our institution, and more data from clinical encounters will lead to a greater understanding of the efficacy of voxelotor.

Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a health in all policy approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm.

Emergency coronary angiography showed single-vessel acute thrombotic occlusion (in three cases of the anterior descending artery and in one case of the right coronary artery), with no evidence of atherosclerotic disease. Because of the high thrombotic burden, in all cases a mechanical thrombus aspiration system was used, tirofiban infusion started and no balloon angioplasty or drug-eluting stent implantation was necessary (Figures ACD). After 72 h, a second SARS-CoV-2 molecular swab tested also negative. In the following days, the pts gradually recovered and they were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: These cases deserve specific considerations both on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the ACS possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 and on the subsequent long-term sequelae. Among various pathophysiologic mechanisms proposed, the high affinity of the spike protein for the angiotensin converting enzyme two receptor (expressed by both cardiac and endothelial cells) could explain direct cardiac viral infection and vasculitis with possible development of thrombosis. The latter could contribute both to acute and long-term cardiac sequelae, even months after the acute infection, configuring a sort of cardiac post-Covid syndrome. Whether and how long this status persists, making COVID-19 a risk factor for subsequent CVDs, is still an unresolved question. In this regard, continuous monitoring of these pts and larger future studies will be essential.

School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of schoolchildren and school personnel. There are rising mental health concerns of frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic symptoms, and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to document community frontline school nursing professionals' experiences and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses' experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited to participate in individual semistructured interviews and shared their roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the school nurses' expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 emerged from the data analysis. These were \\"Managing Stress,\\" \\"Navigating the School Through the Pandemic,\\" and \\"Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional,\\" DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in minimizing the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the primary health care system.

Rift Valley fever is endemic in sub\\\\Saharan Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula, with periodic epidemics characterised by 5C15 years of inter\\\\epizootic periods. In the last two decades, RVF was notified in new African regions (e.g. Sahel), RVF epidemics occurred more frequently and low\\\\level enzootic virus circulation has been demonstrated in livestock in various areas. Recent outbreaks in a French overseas department and some seropositive cases detected in Turkey, Tunisia and Libya raised the attention of the EU for a possible incursion into neighbouring countries. The movement of live animals is the most important pathway for RVF spread from the African endemic areas to North Africa and the Middle East. The movement of infected animals and infected vectors when shipped by flights, containers or road transport is considered as other plausible pathways of introduction into Europe. The overall risk of introduction of RVF into EU through the movement of infected animals is very low in all the EU regions and in all MSs (less than one epidemic every 500 years), given the strict EU animal import policy. The same level of risk of introduction in all the EU regions was estimated also considering the movement of infected vectors, with the highest level for Belgium, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands (one epidemic every 228C700 years), mainly linked to the number of connections by air and sea transports with African RVF infected countries. Although the EU territory does not seem to be directly exposed to an imminent risk of RVFV introduction, the risk of further spread into countries neighbouring the EU and the risks of possible introduction of infected vectors, suggest that EU authorities need to strengthen their surveillance and response capacities, as well as the collaboration with North African and Middle Eastern countries.","output":"Rift Valley Fever C epidemiological update and risk of introduction into Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the COVID-19 pandemic causing huge threat to public health and definite treatment modalities and preventive vaccines yet to be arrived at, some of the key indicators of relevance to its prognosis have started emerging.

We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results: CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95.

As potential pandemic vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines and protein-based vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent pandemic spread worldwide. In this study, we designed plasmid DNA vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) as pandemic vaccine, and the humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were characterized to support proceeding to initial human clinical trials. After intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine encoding S protein with alum adjuvant (three times at 2-week intervals), the humoral immunoreaction, as assessed by anti-S protein or anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, and the cellular immunoreaction, as assessed by antigen-induced IFN expression, were up-regulated. In IgG subclass analysis, IgG2b was induced as the main subclass. Based on these analyses, DNA vaccine with alum adjuvant preferentially induced Th1-type T cell polarization. We confirmed the neutralizing action of DNA vaccine-induced antibodies by a binding assay of RBD recombinant protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralization assays using pseudo-virus, and live SARS-CoV-2. Further B cell epitope mapping analysis using a peptide array showed that most vaccine-induced antibodies recognized the S2 and RBD subunits. Finally, DNA vaccine protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of the level of some laboratory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and platelet count) on the severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We collected the articles published before May 26, 2020. We gathered the laboratory factors in groups of patients with COVID-19, and studied the relation between level of these factors with severity and outcome of the disease. RESULTS: Mean CRP level, creatinine, hemoglobin, and the leukocytes count in the critically ill patients were significantly higher than those of the other groups (non-critical patients); mean CRP = 54.81 mg/l, mean creatinine = 86.82 mol/l, mean hemoglobin = 144.05 g/l, and mean leukocyte count = 7.41  109. The lymphocyte count was higher in patients with mild/moderate disease (mean: 1.32  109) and in the invasive ventilation group (mean value of 0.72  109), but it was considerably lower than those of the other two groups. The results showed that the platelet count was higher in critically ill patients (mean value of 205.96  109). However, the amount was lower in the invasive ventilation group compared with the other groups (mean level = 185.67  109). CONCLUSION: With increasing disease severity, the leukocyte count and the level of CRP increase significantly and the lymphocyte count decreases.

Allergy to PEGs is very rare. Skin testing and graded challenge carries a high risk of inducing systemic reactions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate skin prick test (SPT) and in-vitro reactivity over time to different MW PEGs and assess cross-sensitization patterns in PEG allergy. METHODS: Ten patients with previously diagnosed PEG allergy were skin prick tested twice with PEGs 26 months apart. Lower MW (PEG 300, 3000, 6000) were tested, followed by PEG 20,000 in stepwise, increasing concentrations. Cross-sensitization to polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 was assessed. SPT was performed in 16 healthy controls. In vitro Basophil Histamine Release (HR) test and passive sensitization HR test were performed in patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients previously testing positive on SPT to PEG 3000 and/or 6000 also tested positive to PEG 20,000. Patients with longer interval since diagnosis tested negative to lower MW PEGs and positive mainly to higher concentrations of PEG 20,000. Three patients developed systemic urticaria during SPT. Eight patients showed cross-sensitization to poloxamer 407 and three to polysorbate 80. All controls tested negative. In-vitro tests showed limited usefulness. CONCLUSION: Skin test reactivity to PEG can decrease over time, but titrated SPT with increasing concentrations of PEG 20,000 can be diagnostic when lower MW PEGs test negative. To avoid systemic reactions stepwise SPT is mandatory.

This study assesses postoperative outcomes from a single surgeon experience with the THD device. METHODS From January 2009 to December 2011, 108 THD procedures were performed. With Doppler guidance, the THD device makes possible precise ligation of the branches of the superior hemorrhoidal artery. Patients were seen postoperatively at 3 weeks and 6 months. They underwent physical examination to determine whether there was recurrence of hemorrhoidal prolapse. They were asked to describe any bleeding, to rate pain using the visual analog scale, and to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 = highly satisfied). A phone interview was used for follow-up at 1 year to determine the rate of recurrent prolapse. RESULTS Of the 108 patients who underwent THD, two were lost to follow-up and excluded. All of the remaining 106 patients completed follow-up at 3 weeks and 6 months. At 3 weeks, 92% of patients had no pain and 88% were highly satisfied with the procedure at 3 weeks. This increased to 92% satisfaction at 1 year. Prolapse recurrence was 7.5% at 6 months and 10.3% at 1 year.

METHODS Adult patients of 13 rheumatologists at an academic center with physician-diagnosed rheumatic disease and prescribed disease modifying medications were interviewed by telephone and asked open-ended questions about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on their medications. Responses were analyzed with content and thematic analyses to generate categories that described patterns of medication modification. RESULTS 112 patients (mean age 50, 86% women, 34% non-white race or Latino ethnicity) with diverse diagnoses (30% lupus, 26% rheumatoid arthritis, 44% other), taking various medications were enrolled. Patients reported clinically-relevant issues that were iteratively reviewed to generate unique categories of medication modification: medications and increased or decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; role of hydroxychloroquine; maintaining medication status quo; role of glucocorticoids; increasing or decreasing existing medications in relation to clinical disease activity; postponing infusions; and medication plan if infected by SARS-CoV-2. Some modifications were suboptimal for disease control, but were made to mitigate infection risk and to minimize potential harm when patients were unable to obtain laboratory tests and physical examinations due to cessation of in-person office visits.

These losses have also affected the reliability of communication and employees performance, hence destabilizing the electric power system. This article aims at achieving two objectives. First, analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the communication of performance (human error and human factors) and energy management in electricity production. Second, to develop a conceptual framework model to alleviate effects of the pandemic on the power sector and then improve energy management and human performance. This paper involves investigating the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global production of electricity in the first quarters of 2019 and 2020. A conceptual model was developed based on a case study. Additionally, to ensure reliability, a variable, namely COVID-19, was used as a moderator to examine the effects of the independent and dependent variables. The results show that scores for the internet of things (IoT) with awareness and communication (A&C) and workplace environment management were high with Cronbachs alpha value of 0.87 for the IoT and 0.89 for A&C. These numbers are important indicators of factors that could affect performance and energy management and should not be overlooked by the top management. The results also indicate that the pandemic has had a direct effect on the electricity production sector, and the conceptual framework model revealed that COVID-19, as a moderator, has a direct effect on the variables that significantly affect the improvement of both energy management and employee performance. The case studys results confirm the poor performance in power plant maintenance and operation, in which human error would increase especially in Iraqi power plants that have not yet adopted any internationally recognized standards for energy management. This paper contributes to the literature studying COVID-19s impact on the electricity sector in two ways: first, by developing a model to assist the electricity production sector mitigating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and second, by providing a detailed investigation into the pandemics impact on the electricity sectors global production.

Based on a model that relates the economic activity to infectious disease epidemics, policies that maximize social welfare are considered. Lockdowns in many countries are measures that restrict economic activity over a wide area, and the economic damage they cause is extremely large. Existing studies on the net benefit of lockdown implemented in 2020 have reached mixed conclusions as to whether it is warranted or not. Although the estimates of costs and effects are relatively stable, the setting of the value of a statistical life for converting effects into benefits has a wide range and is also likely to overestimate benefits. Therefore, a careful procedure for setting is particularly crucial to obtain a reliable evaluation of countermeasures. Compared to uniform restriction of activities, taking measures to restrict activities by selecting targets may improve efficiency. Attributes that can be used to select targets include those that can be identified at little or no cost, such as age and industry, and those that can only be identified at a cost, such as close contact with infectious individuals and the presence of pathogens. In comparison to lockdown, these measures may reduce human suffering and economic suffering. No trade-off exists between uniform activity restrictions and selective activity restrictions.","output":"Welfare economics of managing an epidemic: an exposition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In September 2020 Italy held a constitutional referendum.

In this study, grey model (GM(1,1)), nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1)) and fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (FANGBM(1,1)) are compared for the prediction. Therefore, grey prediction models, especially the fractional accumulated grey model, are used for the first time in this topic and it is believed that this study fills the gap in the literature. This model is applied to predict the data for the period 19/03-22/04/2020 (35 days) and forecast the data for the period 23/04-22/05/2020. The number of cases of COVID-19 in these countries are handled cumulatively. The prediction performance of the models is measured by the calculation of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R(2) values. It is obtained that FANGBM(1,1) gives the highest prediction performance with having the lowest RMSE and MAPE values and the highest R(2) values for these countries.

It is global in terms of the promises it makes in declarations and even legally binding instruments (institutional foreground). But many entrenched political practices of interaction do not keep these promises (institutional background). We explain this with the dominance of a traditional diplomatic feel of the game in which often narrowly defined national interests, positioning battles among states, and a subordination of global health under considerations of international security and economics prevail. Based on this diagnosis, we discuss three scenarios for the further evolution of the global health order: (1) the persistence of current institutions, (2) revisions of the institutional foreground and persistence of the background, and (3) a qualitative break that makes amendments to both. While the COVID-19 crisis provides openings for the third and, even more so, the second one, the current upheavals in the liberal constellation of orders makes the first scenario the most likely one.","output":"Global health: an order struggling to keep up with globalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Population-based assessment of disease risk associated with gene variants informs clinical decisions and risk stratification approaches.

Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants for late-onset diseases was modified by age: mean penetrance was 10.3% (95% CI, 9.0%-11.6%) in individuals 70 years or older and 8.5% (95% CI, 7.9%-9.1%) in individuals 20 years or older (difference, 1.8 [95% CI, 0.40-3.3] percentage points). Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was heterogeneous even in known disease predisposition genes, including BRCA1 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), BRCA2 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), and PALB2 (mean [range], 26% [0%-100%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In 2 large biobank cohorts, the estimated penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was variable but generally low.

Our secondary goals were to assess the impact of EEG programs on participants core knowledge, and the agreement between non-experts and experts for seizure identification. SOURCE: Major databases were searched from inception to 30 August 2020. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and descriptive studies were all considered if they reported an EEG curriculum for non-neurologists in a critical care setting. Data were presented thematically for the qualitative primary outcome and a meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed for the quantitative secondary outcomes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-nine studies were included after reviewing 7,486 citations. Twenty-two studies were single centre, 17 were from North America, and 16 were published after 2016. Most EEG studies were targeted to critical care nurses (17 studies), focused on processed forms of EEG with amplitude-integrated EEG being the most common (15 studies), and were shorter than one day in duration (24 studies). In pre-post studies, EEG programs significantly improved participants knowledge of tested material (standardized mean change, 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 2.73). Agreement for seizure identification between non-experts and experts was moderate (Cohens kappa = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to teach basic EEG to participants in critical care settings from different clinical backgrounds, including physicians and nurses.

A recent large-scale study systematically identified in vitro substrates for most human protein kinases. Here, we reprocessed and filtered these data to generate an in vitro Kinase-to-Phosphosite database (iKiP-DB). We show that iKiP-DB can accurately predict changes in kinase activity in published phosphoproteomic data sets for both well-studied and poorly characterized kinases. We apply iKiP-DB to a newly generated phosphoproteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells and provide evidence for coronavirus-induced changes in host cell kinase activity.

METHODS Water extracts of TF were mixed at ratios 1:1, 3:2 and 2:3 (w/w). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was then utilized as metabolomics screening. Human Metabolome (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and Lipidmaps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/) databases were used to annotate detected compounds. Further identification of vital genes and important pathways associated with the anti-RA properties of the TF preparations was done via network pharmacology, and verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). RESULTS Four key compounds involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and isoflavonoid biosynthesis were identified through metabolomics analyses. Three key components of TF associated with anti-RA activity were linoleic acid, daidzein, and daidzin.

Non-obstructive general angioscopy can help monitor the aortic intima and detect the locations of abnormal findings, while aortic angioscopy can detect vulnerable plaques in the aorta, which are difficult to visualize using conventional diagnostic methods. Herein, we report the case of a patient with non-anastomotic thoracic aortic graft rupture diagnosed using non-obstructive aortic angioscopy. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old man who had undergone total arch replacement 5 years prior complained of chest pain. Emergent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an intra-mediastinal hematoma around the vascular graft of the ascending aorta and angiography revealed pooling of contrast medium on the dorsal side of the vascular graft. We suspected extravasation of the thoracic vascular graft. Aortic angioscopic examination revealed a red vascular graft defect that matched extravasation at the contralateral level of the prosthetic left common carotid artery branch. Subsequently, non-anastomotic thoracic aortic graft rupture was diagnosed. The patient underwent a two-debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (Zone 0) with a right subclavian artery-left common carotid artery-left subclavian artery bypass. Postoperative angiography revealed disappearance of the extravasation from the graft rupture site, patent grafted vessels with flow, and no endoleak. Follow-up CT at 6 months postoperatively showed no extravasation. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-anastomotic thoracic aortic graft rupture detected using non-obstructive aortic angioscopy.

METHODS: This was an observational study of children with MIS-C (May 1 to June 24, 2020), in three pediatric hospitals in Santiago. Demographic characteristics and epidemiological data, medical history, laboratory tests, cardiology evaluations, treatment, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were admitted (median age 6, range 0-14 years). Sixteen of the 27 (59%) required intensive care unit admission; there were no deaths. Seventy-four percent had no comorbidities, and the median number of days of symptoms before admission was 4 (range 2-9 days). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most frequent, and inflammatory markers were increased at admission. A recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was detected in 82% of cases. The severe group showed significantly lower hemoglobin and albumin levels, decreased platelet counts, and higher d-dimer during disease evolution. Echocardiography showed abnormalities (myocardial, pericardial, or coronary) in 12 patients (46%) during their hospital stay. Anti-inflammatory treatment (immunoglobulin and/or corticosteroids) was prescribed in 24 patients. MIS-C appeared in clusters weeks after the peak of SARS-CoV-2 cases, especially in the most vulnerable areas of Santiago.

This paper presents a machine learning ensemble framework to improve the accuracy and consistency of train delay prediction. The basic idea is to train many different types of machine learning models for each station along a chosen journey of train service using historical data and relevant weather data, and then with certain criteria to choose some models to build an ensemble. It then combines the outputs from its member models with an aggregation function to produce the final prediction. Two aggregation functions were devised to combine the outputs of individual models: averaging and weighted averaging. These ensembles were implemented with a framework and their performance was tested with the data from an intercity train service as a case study. The accuracy was measured by the percentages of correct prediction of the arrival time for a train and correct prediction within one minute to the actual arrival time. The mean accuracies and standard deviations are 42.3%([Formula: see text] ) from the individual models, 57.8%([Formula: see text] ) from the averaging ensembles, and 72.8%([Formula: see text] ) from the weighted ensembles.

Multiple factors are assumed to influence the development of EF, among them biological maturation. Currently the effect of biological maturation on EF performance is largely unexplored, in contrast to other domains like physical development or sports performance. Therefore, this study aimed (a) to explore the effect of chronological age on EF performance and (b) to investigate to what extent age-related changes found in EF are affected by biological maturation on both sexes. To this end, EF performance and degree of maturity, indexed by percentage of predicted adult height (%PAH), of 90 adolescents (11C16 years old, 54% males) were measured on three occasions in a time frame of 12 months. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approach was used to examine the association between chronological age and %PAH and the weighted sum scores for each EF component (i.e., inhibition, planning, working memory, shifting). All models were run separately for both sexes. The males results indicated that EF performance improved with age and degree of maturity on all four components. Interaction effects between age and %PAH on inhibition showed that at a younger age, males with a higher %PAH had a lower chance of performing well on inhibition, whereas at later ages, males with a higher %PAH had a higher chance to have a good inhibition performance. For working memory, it seems that there is no maturity effect at a younger age, while at later ages, a disadvantage for later maturing peers compared to on-time and earlier maturing male adolescents emerged. Females showed slightly different results. Here, age positively influenced EF performance, whereas maturity only influenced inhibition. Interaction effects emerged for working memory only, with opposite results from the males. At younger ages, females with lower %PAH values seem to be scoring higher, whereas at later ages, no maturity effect is observed. This study is one of the first to investigate the effect of biological maturation on EF performance, and shows that distinct components of EF are influenced by maturational status, although the effects are different in both sexes. Further research is warranted to unravel the implications for maturation-driven effects on EF that might significantly affect domains of human functioning like academic achievement and social development.","output":"The Effects of Age, Biological Maturation and Sex on the Development of Executive Functions in Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective: The Covid-19 pandemic continues challenging health systems globally, exposing healthcare workers to constant physical and psychological stressors. To date, several studies have already shown the catastrophic impact on the mental health of medical personnel during the early period of the pandemic. Nevertheless, literature evidences the dearth of works that evaluate the effect over time, understanding the pandemic as a sustained extreme stressor. The present study examines the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers at six months follow-up. Material and methods: A total of 141 frontline healthcare workers from two tertiary hospitals were recruited between July and November 2020. Healthcare workers were evaluated psychologically at baseline and six months follow-up (January to May 2021) using psychometric tests for the assessment of acute stress (VASS, PSS-10, PCL-5), anxiety (STAI) and depression (PHQ-2). Results: Overall, there was a general worsening of the mental health between the two psychological assessments, especially regarding depression and predisposition to perceiving the situations as a threat. Nurses and nurse aides showed poorer mental health while physicians improved over time. Reduced working hours and higher physical exercise resulted in better mental health among healthcare workers. Women and nursing staff were the most affected by psychological distress at baseline and six months follow-up.

The procedure involved placing 10 coils unilaterally. Various QCT parameters were derived using Apollo imaging software (VIDA). Independent predictors of clinically relevant outcome (6-MWT  26 m, FEV1  12%, RV  10%) were identified through stepwise linear regression analysis. Results The response outcome for 6-MWT, for FEV1 and for RV was met by 55%, 32% and 42%, respectively. For 6-MWT  26 m a lower baseline 6-MWT (p = 0.0003) and a larger standard deviation (SD) of low attenuation cluster (LAC) sizes in peripheral regions of treated lung (p = 0.0037) were significantly associated with positive outcome. For FEV1  12%, lower baseline FEV1 (p = 0.02) and larger median LAC sizes in the central regions of treated lobe (p = 0.0018) were significant predictors of good response.

Moreover, since it is identified as an inhibitor for importin &#945;/?-mediated nuclear localization signal (NLS), IVM is also reported to have antiviral potential against several RNA and DNA viruses. Since therapeutic use of IVM in COVID-19 cases has recently been postulated, the potential antiviral activity of IVM against bovine respiratory viruses including BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV are evaluated in this study. For these purposes, virus titration assay was used to evaluate titers in viral harvest from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic IVM concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 M) and compared to titers from non-treated infected cells. This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV, BPIV-3 and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION: Post-acute COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Demographic, anamnestic and clinical characteristics, laboratory exams and medical imaging findings were collected for the entire cohort. Outcome measures evaluated at the admission in Rehabilitation Unit were: type of respiratory supports needed, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), FiO2/PaO2, Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT). Furthermore, we proposed an early rehabilitation protocol for COVID-19 patients based on baseline FiO2. RESULTS: We included 32 post-acute COVID-19 patients (22 male and 10 female), mean aged 72.610.9 years.

METHODS: Psychological conditions were evaluated by the multiple psychological evaluation scales in HCWs at the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area in China) during COVID-19 epidemic. According to the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, HCWs were divided into two groups: HCWs with high-risk (HHCW) group (who worked in wards for COVID-19 patients) and HCWs with low-risk (LHCW) group (who worked in wards for non-COVID-19 patients in the same hospital). The clinical data of psychological evaluation scales from HCWs were collected. RESULTS: A total of 171 HCWs were recruited in this study, with 94 (55.0%) HCWs in the HHCW group, and 77 (45.0%) HCWs in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in gender, work stress, job risk, and levels of fear and anxiety, and the depression between the two groups (P < 0.05). The incidence of PTSS was 28.7% in HHCW group, while the incidence of PTSS was 13.0% in LHCW group. The PTSS between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Further logistic regression analysis displayed that the exposure to COVID-19, work stress and coping strategies were major risk factors associated with PTSS.

By developing an understanding of the skills students perceive to be necessary for their careers following the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons can be drawn with industry perspectives to determine whether these perspectives align and, more importantly, support students successful development of skills as sought by the industry. An online survey of current undergraduate tertiary aviation students at Australian universities was conducted to determine the perceived impediments, additional skills required, post-graduation plans and how university courses should evolve post-COVID-19. The results show that students are cognisant of the current oversupply of aviation professionals due to the downturn in the industry and are seeking further support with the development of non-technical skills to better prepare themselves to be competitive following graduation. These findings have implications for both undergraduate aviation students and universities offering an undergraduate aviation program. By considering these findings universities can adapt their programs to better prepare students and support the development of skilled aviation professionals, equipped to deal with challenges of the post-COVID-19 aviation industry.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on current tertiary aviation education and future careers: Students perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is widely understood that CRISPR-Cas9 technology is revolutionary, with well-recognized issues including the potential for off-target edits and the attendant need for spatiotemporal control of editing.

Kaplan-Meier curves and survival models were assessed with adjustment for confounding and with stratification according to gestational age, birth weight, and status of being small for gestational age. RESULTS: A total of 11,481,215 live-born children were followed to 36 months of age. The mortality rate was 52.6 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.6 to 58.0) per 1000 person-years among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with 5.6 deaths (95% CI, 5.6 to 5.7) per 1000 person-years among those without the syndrome.

However, the actual effectiveness of LUS in characterizing lung involvement in COVID-19 is still unclear. Our aim was to evaluate LUS diagnostic performance in assessing or ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia when compared with chest CT (gold standard) in a population of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Methods: A total of 260 consecutive RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were included in the study. All the patients underwent both chest CT scan and concurrent LUS at admission, within the first 6C12 h of hospital stay. Results: Chest CT scan was considered positive when showing a typical or indeterminate pattern for COVID-19, according to the RSNA classification system. Disease prevalence for COVID-19 pneumonia was 90.77%. LUS demonstrated a sensitivity of 56.78% in detecting lung alteration. The concordance rate for the assessment of abnormalities by both methods increased in the case of peripheral distribution and middle-lower lung location of lesions and in cases of more severe lung involvement. A total of nine patients had a false-positive LUS examination. Alternative diagnosis included chronic heart disease (six cases), bronchiectasis (two cases), and subpleural emphysema (one case). LUS specificity was 62.50%. Collateral findings indicative of overlapping conditions at chest CT were recorded also in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and appeared distributed with increasing frequency passing from the group with mild disease (17 cases) to that with severe disease (40 cases). Conclusions: LUS does not seem to be an adequate tool for screening purposes in the ED, due to the risk of missing some lesions and/or to underestimate the actual extent of the disease. Furthermore, the not specificity of LUS implies the possibility to erroneously classify pre-existing or overlapping conditions as COVID-19 pneumonia. It seems more safe to integrate a positive LUS examination with clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiologic findings to suggest a virosis.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the indication and administration of sufentanil by paramedics in the treatment of pain in acute trauma adult patients without the physicians control. METHODS: Paramedics underwent voluntarily the simulation training aimed at administering intravenously sufentanil to treat pain in acute trauma in adults without physicians indication. Subsequently, the adverse events and efficacy were monitored for a six-month period and compared in two groups: administration of sufentanil by paramedics without this competence, who further consulted the administration by telephone with physicians (group Consultation) and those with this competence (group Competence). RESULTS: A total number of sufentanil administration in group Consultation was 88 and in group Competence 70.

More recently, the strain of the global COVID-19 pandemic on hospital resources has forced many units to alter the timing of interval surgery and extend the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles. In order to support this paradigm shift and provide more accurate counseling during these unprecedented times, we investigated the survival outcomes in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients with the intent of maximal cytoreduction following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with respect to timing of surgery and degree of cytoreduction. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients aged 18 years and above with FIGO (2014) stage III/IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the intention of interval cytoreduction surgery between January 2008 and December 2017 was conducted. Overall and progression-free survival outcomes were analyzed and compared with patients who only received chemotherapy. Outcome measures were correlated with the number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles and amount of residual disease following surgery. RESULTS Six hundred and seventy-one patients (median age 67 (range 20-91) years) were included in the study with 572 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery and 99 patients with chemotherapy only. There was no difference in the proportion of patients in whom complete cytoreduction was achieved based on number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (2-4 cycles: 67.7%, n=337/498); 5 cycles: 62.2%, n=46/74). Patients undergoing cytoreduction surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a median 5-year progression-free and overall survival of 24 and 38 months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival between surgical groups was observed (interval cytoreduction: 41 months vs delayed cytoreduction: 43 months, p=0.52). Those who achieved complete cytoreduction to R0 (no macroscopic disease) had a significant median overall survival advantage compared with those with any macroscopic residual disease (R0: 49-51 months vs R<1: 22-39 months, p<0.001 vs R1: 23-26 months, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Survival outcomes do not appear to be worse for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy if cytoreduction surgery is delayed beyond three cycles. In advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients the imperative to achieve complete surgical cytoreduction remains gold standard, irrespective of surgical timing, for best survival benefit.","output":"Survival outcomes after delayed cytoreduction surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the age and sex distribution of the reported COVID-19 deaths in Austria.

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing patient contact with healthcare facilities and other patients, while maintaining treatment continuity and avoiding loss to care, has become more urgent, resulting in efforts to increase DSD uptake. We assessed the extent to which DSD coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) dispensing intervals have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia. MethodsWe used patient data from Zambias electronic medical record system (SmartCare) for 737 health facilities, representing about 3/4 of all ART patients nationally, to compare the numbers and proportional distributions of patients enrolled in DSD models in the six months before and six months after the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Zambia in March 2020. Segmented linear regression was used to determine whether the introduction of COVID-19 into Zambia further accelerated the increase in DSD scale-up. ResultsBetween September 2019 and August 2020, 181,317 patients aged 15+ (81,520 and 99,797 from September 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020 and from March 1 to August 31, 2020, respectively) enrolled in DSD models in Zambia. Overall participation in all DSD models increased over the study period, but uptake varied by model.

The hallmark of T(regs) is the expression of the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor. Natural regulatory T cells (nT(regs)) are a distinct population of T cells that express CD4 and FoxP3. nTregs develop in the thymus and function in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance. Other CD4(+), CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD8(+)CD28(-) T cells can be induced to acquire regulatory function by antigenic stimulation, depending on the cytokine milieu. Inducible (or adaptive) T(regs) frequently express high levels of the interleukin 2 receptor (CD25). Atypical T(regs) express FoxP3 and CD4 but have no surface expression of CD25. Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) produce IL-10, while T helper 3 cells (Th3) produce TGF-. The function of inducible T(regs) is presumably to maintain immune homeostasis, especially in the context of chronic inflammation or infection. Induction of T(regs) in coronaviral infections protects against the more severe forms of the disease attributable to the host response. However, arteriviruses have exploited these T cell subsets as a means to dampen the immune response allowing for viral persistence.

This high prevalence of simulation practices in nursing programs has led to opportunities to research this topic from various angles, including its impact on students skill performance, self-efficacy, self-confidence, self-satisfaction, and clinical knowledge acquisition. Design and Methods: Participants in this qualitative study included 54 senior female undergraduates enrolled in a critical care nursing course in Saudi Arabia. Recordings were made of six authentic, acute care simulation sessions. One of these sessions was examined in depth using discourse analysis approaches to gain insights into communication in simulation sessions, examining the way students linguistically managed this critical communication, exhibiting their logical, reflective, decision-making, problem-solving, and collaborative work skills and use of communicative strategies. Results: The analyses revealed various training and communication issues including the lack of harmony among the team members (e.g., regarding understanding and performing their assigned roles as well as delegating and conducting delegated tasks) and the students inability to effectively communicate with the patient as a valuable source of information and to make appropriate and timely clinical decisions regarding patient assessment. Conclusions: Simulation sessions have been shown to be a promising instructional tool to support nursing education, allowing students to practice in a safe and controlled environment. However, for more effective sessions and to avoid poor simulation sessions, students need to be thoroughly briefed regarding the sessions prior to implementation.","output":"Shes dead!

METHODS: A total of 71 age-matched pediatric IA and COVID-19 patient pairs were formed and their clinical data on admission were compared. RESULTS: Fever, cough, nasal congestion and nausea/vomiting were the most common symptoms on admission for both infections but occurred less often in COVID-19. The IA patients were more likely to have lower-than-normal levels of lymphocyte count and percentage and to have higher-than-normal levels of activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, serum C-reactive protein, and serum procalcitonin, while the COVID-19 patients had higher odds of having lower-than-normal levels of neutrophil count and percentage. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that influenza A is more symptomatic than COVID-19 for children and might be an overall more severe infection at the time of admission.

Challenges in getting the public to accept the vaccine may be due to vaccine hesitancy which may be caused by poor knowledge, poor attitude, ethical issues and safety concerns. The study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude and factors affecting the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among traders at Edaiken market, Uselu, Benin City, Edo State. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 400 traders using multistage sampling technique in Benin City, Edo State. A forty-one-item questionnaire was utilized to collect data. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 and quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, proportions, means and standard deviation. Level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: A higher proportion (35.2%) of respondents were aged between 20 - 29 years of age and almost three-quarters (74.0%) were females, while 48.7% were married. Almost one-third, 30% of the respondents had good knowledge of COVID-19 and 375 (93.8%) had poor knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccine. One-fifth (20.8%) of respondents had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine and 90 (22.5%) respondents did not know where to get the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines was poor among the respondents, with most of them displaying a negative attitude to the vaccine. Knowledge of locations for obtaining vaccines was reported as a factor that would influence vaccine uptake.

Robust clinical data collection faces many hurdles, preventing full CDG biological and clinical comprehension. Web-based platforms offer privileged opportunities for biomedical data gathering, and participant recruitment, particularly in rare diseases. The immunology and CDG electronic (e-) questionnaire (ImmunoCDGQ) explores this paradigm, proposing a people-centric framework to advance health research and participant empowerment. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to: (1) Describe and characterize the ImmunoCDGQ development, engagement, recruitment, participation, and result dissemination strategies; (2) To critically compare this framework with published literature and making recommendations. METHODS: An international, multistakeholder people-centric approach was initiated to develop and distribute the ImmunoCDGQ, a multi-lingual e-questionnaire able to collect immune-related data directly from patients and family caregivers. An adapted version was produced and distributed among the general healthy population (ImmunoHealthyQ), serving as the control group. Literature screening was performed to identify and analyze comparable studies. RESULTS: The ImmunoCDGQ attained high participation and inclusion rates (94.6%, 209 out of 221). Comparatively to the control, CDG participants also showed higher and more variable questionnaire completion times as well as increased English version representativeness. Additionally, 20% of the CDG group (42 out of 209) chose not to complete the entire questionnaire in one go. Conditional logic structuring guided participant data provision and accurate data analysis assignment. Multi-channel recruitment created sustained engagement with Facebook emerging as the most followed social media outlet. Still, most included ImmunoCDGQ questionnaires (50.7%, 106 out of 209) were submitted within the first month of the projects launch. Literature search and analysis showed that most e-questionnaire-based studies in rare diseases are author-built (56.8%, 25 out of 44), simultaneously addressing medical and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and/or information needs (79.5%, 35 out of 44). Also, over 68% of the studies adopt multi-platform recruitment (30 out of 44) actively supported by patient organizations (52.3%, 23 out of 44). CONCLUSIONS: The ImmunoCDGQ, its methodology and the CDG Community served as models for health research, hence paving a successful and reproducible road to people-centricity in biomedical research.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report on the kinetics, durability, and neutralizing ability of the induced immunity of the BBIBP vaccine, and the intensified antibody response elicited by the booster. METHODS: A total of 353 healthy adult participants, aged 20C74 years, were recruited in this multicenter study. A standard dose of the BBIBP vaccine was administered (Month 0), followed by a second standard dose (Month 1), and a booster dose (after Month 7). Vaccine\\\\induced virus\\\\specific antibody levels (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\IgA/IgM/IgG), conventional virus neutralization test (cVNT), pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT), and surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) were monitored over multiple time points. RESULTS: Neutralizing titers induced by the two doses of inactivated vaccine for COVID\\\\19 peaked at Month 2 and declined to 33.89% at Month 6. Following the booster dose, elevated levels of antibodies were induced for IgA, IgG, and neutralizing antibodies, with neutralizing titer reaching 13.2 times that of before the booster. CONCLUSION: By monitoring the antibody titer levels postvaccination, this study has shown that serum antibody levels will decrease over time, but a notable spike in antibody levels postbooster highlights the anamnestic immune response.

As of August 2020, i.e. 6 months after the first COVID-19 publication was released, more than 40000 articles have been published in Medline, the 1552 being indexed as case reports (COVID Group). During the same period, a Medline search for case reports about infectious diseases excluding COVID-19 (ID Group), identified 496 publications. The two groups were compared in terms of authorship. COVID-19 case reports had a mean of 6.1 authors per manuscript (median 5, SD 3.8), compared to 6.2 (median 5, SD 3.3) in the other group (p = .43). The COVID-19 group had 51 cases (3.3%) authored from 15 or more authors, compared to 1.4% (7 cases) in the ID group (p = .03). Fourteen percent of all COVID-19 case reports have 10 or more authors and 13 manuscripts (1%) have been authored by 20 or more persons.

Cancer patients in particular were regarded as vulnerable and oncology departments drastically modified their Care systems and established new priorities. We evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the activity of a single cancer center;and we studied patients perspectives of the preventive institutional or governmental safety measures. Methods: : We performed a retrospective analysis of (i) Volumes of Oncological activities (2020 versus 2019), (ii) patients perception rate of the preventive measures, (iii) patients SARS-Cov-2 infections, clinical signs thereof and (iv) new diagnoses made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results: : As compared with a similar timeframe in 2019 the overall activity in total numbers of outpatient chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits, based on weekly average of daily accesses was not statistically different;while inpatient admissions decreased for both medical oncology and thoracic oncology (18% (p=0.0018) and 44% (p<0.0001) respectively). Cancer diagnosis plummeted (34%), but no stage shift could be demonstrated.Acceptance and adoption of hygienic measures was high, as measured by a targeted questionnaire administered to a sample of outpatients (>85%). However, only 46.2% of responding patients regarded telemedicine, although widely deployed, as an efficient surrogate to a consultation. Thirty-three patients developed SARS-CoV-2, 27 were hospitalized and 11 died within this time frame. These infected patients were younger, current smokers and suffered more comorbidities. Conclusions: : This retrospective cohort analysis demonstrates that continuation of active cancer therapy and specialist visits is feasible and safe after implementation of population-wide, institutional and department specific safety measures. Substantial decreases in diagnosis of solid tumors were recorded. To manage the backlog of belated diagnoses, while providing continued state-of-the-art cancer care during this prolonged health crisis, we need policy interventions to adapt the health care system and allow telemedicine to fulfill a more prominent role.","output":"Meeting the Challenges in Oncology Care Management During the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic: A Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite rigorous disinfection, fumigation and air treatment, infectious microbial load has been found to circulate and survive for significant duration in health care settings. This raises significant concerns for hospital acquired infections. We have developed a novel, hybrid, trap-and-kill airborne-microbicidal technology called ZeBox which is efficient in clearing 99.999% of airborne microbial load under controlled lab conditions. In this study we evaluate the clinical performance of the ZeBox in reducing airborne and surface microbial load in two independent hospital settings. Methods: The studies were conducted in single bed and multi bed ICU of two hospitals. Airborne and surface microbial loads were collected at pre-determined sampling sites pre- and post-deployment of the ZeBox enabled device. The Normality of data distribution was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance was determined using Students T test and Mann-Whitneys U test. Pathogenic and opportunistic organisms were characterized using 16S rDNA sequencing. Furthermore, the antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated organisms was tested against current treatments of choice across major antibiotic classes. Results: Post-deployment, we found statistically significant reductions in both airborne and surface microbial load within the operating range of the ZeBox enabled technology . Across the both hospital ICUs, there was 90% reduction of airborne microbial load on average, and 75% reduction of surface microbial load on average, providing a low bioburden zone of roughly 10-15 feet diameter around the unit. These reduced microbial levels were maintained during the entire duration of device operation over several weeks. Many of the clinical isolates recovered from one of the hospitals were drug resistant, which highlighted the potential ability of ZeBox to eliminate drug-resistant microbes and thereby reduce the frequency of hospital acquired infections. Conclusions: ZeBox enabled technology can significantly reduce a broad spectrum of microbial burden in air and on surfaces in clinical settings. It can thereby serve an unmet need in reducing the incidence of hospital acquired infections.","output":"Effectiveness of a novel non-intrusive continuous-use air decontamination technology to reduce microbial contamination in clinical settings: A multi-centric study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been acknowledged as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

These recommendations should be appreciated as a positive step but they have caused serious financial implications for dental practices. It can be concluded that current dental practice globally is limited to the provision of emergency treatments only. This step is appreciative, but has resulted in huge financial losses sustained by dental care providers (DCPs) worldwide. The governments and health regulatory bodies of developed countries are trying to help dental practices to evolve from this troublesome situation, but there is no visible policy from the underdeveloped world that could help the DCPs to save their practices from closing down due to the financial constraints.","output":"Current Clinical Dental Practice Guidelines and the Financial Impact of COVID-19 on Dental Care Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Os c?es j fazem parte do cotidiano do homem h milhares de anos.

Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment to make recommendations for dosing. METHODS: COVID-19 agents included in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool COVID-19 drug interaction website (www.covid19-druginteractions.org), initially identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic databases. FINDINGS: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin, tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities. CONCLUSION: Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is complex. These recommendations were produced to provide guidance to clinicians worldwide who are treating patients with COVID-19, many of whom will have some degree of acute or chronic renal or hepatic impairment.","output":"Recommendations for Dosing of Repurposed COVID-19 Medications in Patients with Renal and Hepatic Impairment"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function V(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(O,[["render",V]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"doctor/63.md","filePath":"doctor/63.md"}'),R={name:"doctor/63.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
