This leads to human insecurity in these areas. Children, adolescents, and youth are out of school. Primary and secondary school teachers are unable to travel to unsafe areas. Due to the problem of human insecurity in rural areas and especially poverty in several rural areas of CAR, parents are unable to finance the education of their children who have taken the baccalaureate exams to travel to the capital Bangui to study at Bangui University alone. In this article, we propose a platform for the continuity of educational activities in the Central African Republic. Our initially proposed platform solution allows the creation of a distance primary and secondary school in bimodal mode in the rural areas of the CAR. In a second step, it allows the creation of a complete distance university training coupled with traditional education for young people from all rural areas of the Central African Republic. This platform has been tested at the Higher Institute of Technology (Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications) and the Faculty of Science of the University of Bangui and has enabled the partial resumption of pedagogical activities in these institutions. It has been applied in the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and can be extended to other disciplines. Access to resources is efficient thanks to the coupling of the WireGuard VPN server and the Apache Guacamole server which is a gateway using standard protocols via a browser. It also uses VXLAN technology which moves the WireGuard VPN server subnet from OSI Layer 3 to Layer 2 and allows the organization of practical work that requires being in the same local subnet.

Starting from the Wuhan city in China, COVID-19 has conquered the entire world with its rapid progression. But seeking the importance towards the human situation, it has become essential to build such an automated model to diagnose COVID-19 within less computational time easily. As the disease has spread, there is not enough data to implement an accurate COVID-19 predicting model. But technology is a boon, which makes it possible. Effective techniques based on medical imaging using artificial intelligence have approached to assist humans in needful time. It has become very essential to detect COVID-19 in humans at an early stage to prevent it from becoming more infectious. The neural networks have shown promising results in medical imaging. In this research, a deep learning-based approach is used for image classification to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray images (CXR). A CNN classifier have been used to classify the normal-healthy images from the COVID-19 images, using transfer learning. The concept of early stopping is used to enhance the accuracy of the proposed DenseNet model. The results of the system have been evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score metrics. An automated comparative analysis among multiple optimizers, LR Scheduler and Loss Function is performed to get the highest accuracy suitable for the proposed system.

Utilizing principles of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, this novel minimally invasive approach optimizes access for safe and complete removal of these lesions without the need for a formal rectal resection. We describe our technique and early outcomes with TEVA excision. METHODS Between March 2010 and September 2011, TEVA excision was performed for patients presenting for management of rectal lesions not amenable to colonoscopic or standard transanal removal. Patients were selected if they presented with benign disease or superficial adenocarcinoma, and the proximal extent of the lesion extended beyond 8 cm from the anal verge. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were assessed. A SILS? port was placed in the anal canal for access in all cases. Standard laparoscopic instruments were utilized for visualization, full-thickness transanal excision, and primary closure. RESULTS Twenty patients (50% male) with a mean age of 64.6  10.9 years, mean body mass index of 28.2  4.9 kg/m(2), and median American Society of Anesthesiologist score of 2 underwent TEVA excision. Fourteen patients (70%) presented with benign disease and six patients (30%) presented with malignant disease.

The network between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes was analyzed based on functional protein associations using STRING. In addition, STITCH was employed to determine druggable targets. DPP4 was the only immune system process gene, which was coexpressed with the three HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes, while eight other immune genes were at least coexpressed with two HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes. STRING analysis between immune and HT-SARS-CoV-2 genes plotted 19 associations of which there were eight common networking genes in mixed healthy (323) and pan-cancer (11003) tissues in addition to normal (87), cancer (90), and diabetic (128) pancreatic tissues. Using this approach, three commonly applicable druggable connections between HT-SARS-CoV-2 and immune system process genes were identified. These include positive associations of ACE2DPP4 and TMPRSS2SRC as well as a negative association of FURIN with ADAM17.

METHODS AND RESULTS: To gain insight into the functional divergence of NHX genes in honeysuckle, a total of seven LjNHX genes were identified on the whole genome level and were renamed according to their chromosomal positions. All LjNHXs possessed the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger domain and the amiloride-binding site was presented in all NHX proteins except LjNHX4. The phylogenetic analysis divided the seven NHX genes into Vac-clade (LjNHX1/2/3/4/5/7) and PM-clade (LjNHX6) based on their subcellular localization and validated by the distribution of conserved protein motifs and exon/intron organization analysis. The protein-protein interaction network showed that LjNHX4/5/6/7 shared the same putatively interactive proteins, including SOS2, SOS3, HKT1, and AVP1. Cis-acting elements and gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested that most LjNHXs involve in the response to salt stress through ion transmembrane transport. The expression profile analysis revealed that the expression levels of LjNHX3/7 were remarkably affected by salinity.

Perspectives of provider groups have conveyed wide-ranging experiences of adversity, distress, and resilience. In understanding and responding to the emotional and psychological implications of the pandemic for renal clinicians, it is vital to recognize that many experiences also have been ethically challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted rapid and extensive transformation of health care systems and widely impacted care provision, heightening the risk of barriers to fulfillment of ethical duties. Given this, it is likely that some clinicians also have experienced moral distress, which can occur if an individual is unable to act in accordance with their moral judgment owing to external barriers. This review presents a global perspective of potential experiences of moral distress in kidney care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using nephrology cases, we discuss why moral distress may be experienced by health professionals when withholding or withdrawing potentially beneficial treatments owing to resource constraints, when providing care that is inconsistent with local prepandemic best practice standards, and when managing dual professional and personal roles with conflicting responsibilities. We argue that in addition to responsive and appropriate health system supports, resources, and education, it is imperative for health care providers to recognize and prevent moral distress to foster the psychological well-being and moral resilience of clinicians during extended periods of crisis within health systems.","output":"Moral Distress and Moral Injury in Nephrology During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly growing pandemic that requires urgent therapeutic intervention. Finding potential anti COVID-19 drugs aside from approved vaccines is progressively going on. The chemically diverse natural products represent valuable sources for drug leads. In this study, we aimed to find out safe and effective COVID-19 protease inhibitors from a library of natural products which share the main nucleus/skeleton of FDA-approved drugs that were employed in COVID-19 treatment guidelines or repurposed by previous studies. Our library was subjected to virtual screening against SARS-CoV Main protease (Mpro) using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software. Twenty-two out of those natural candidates showed higher binding scores compared to their analogues. We repurpose these natural products including alkaloids, glucosinolates, and phenolics as potential platforms for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. This study paves the way towards discovering a lead used in the treatment of COVID-19 from natural sources and introduces phytomedicines with dual therapeutic effects against COVID-19 besides their original pharmacological effects.

However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire. There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes. More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb. Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format. Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection. We demonstrate PRESCIENT's ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice. In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell. Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations. The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.","output":"PRESCIENT: platform for the rapid evaluation of antibody success using integrated microfluidics enabled technology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The approach to diagnosing, treating and monitoring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection relies strongly on laboratory resources, with serological testing representing the mainstay for studying the onset, nature and persistence of humoral immune response. This study was aimed at evaluating the analytical performance of the novel Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay. Methods. This analytical assessment encompassed the calculation of intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision, linearity, limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD), functional sensitivity, and comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values obtained on paired serum samples using DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Diagnostic performance was also tested against results of molecular testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, collected over the previous 4 months. Results. Intra-assay, inter-assay and total imprecision of Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were between 4.3-4.8%, 2.3-3.9% and 4.9-6.2%, respectively. The linearity of the assay was excellent between 0.11-18.8 antibody titers. The LOB, LOD and functional sensitivity were 0.02, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve; AUC) of Beckman Coulter anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG compared to molecular testing was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91; p<0.001) using manufacturer's cut-off, and increased to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.94; p<0.001) with antibody titers. The AUC was non-significantly different from that of Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, but was always higher than that of DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG.

Here, we summarize various barriers to adopting these practices, interventions used to improve adoption, and challenges in measuring the effectiveness of these interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The Choosing Wisely? campaign has become an international effort with more than 20 countries worldwide having embraced it. Such widespread interest indicates that the campaign initiated an important dialog between patients and physicians about overutilization of resources. Evidence showing the positive impact of interventions on adopting these practices is accumulating, but their effect on improving clinical outcomes is uncertain. SUMMARY: Decreasing overuse of resources is a cultural change in perspective for practitioners and patients alike. We believe that healthcare delivery is transitioning from being volume-based to value-based.

Epitope mapping revealed WS6 to target a region in the S2 subunit, which was conserved among SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43. The crystal structure at 2-angstrom resolution of WS6 with its S2 epitope revealed recognition to center on a conserved helix, which was occluded in both prefusion and post-fusion spike conformations. Structural and neutralization analyses indicated WS6 to neutralize by inhibiting fusion, post-viral attachment.

RESULTS After screening and full-text review, 27 studies were included, totaling 19 different interventions. Many of the available interventions have not yet been clinically tested. Those that have undergone effectiveness evaluation (10 interventions) showed good rates of effectiveness and feasibility, with some exceptions. The most widely used intervention model is the safety plan, which allows the user to implement coping and distracting strategies in case of suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS Ecological momentary interventions provide certain advantages, such as their wide availability, versatility, and potential for customization. These interventions can be useful complements to traditional care, especially in situations in which face-to-face care is not possible.

A convenience sample of 902 Israeli adults (mean age = 46.21) completed measures of peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms and resilience, and reported on their media use experiences one month following the initial outbreak of the disease in Israel (April 2020). After controlling for COVID-19 related events and demographic covariates, experiencing media use as having a negative impact on coping was related to higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of resilience. In contrast, experiencing media as having a positive impact was not related to peritraumatic distress, anxiety symptoms or resilience. The findings suggest that those reporting that media use had a negative impact on coping are at greater risk of experiencing higher levels of peritraumatic distress and anxiety symptoms as well as lower resilience. In addition, traditional media use was related to higher resiliency. Developing understanding of how media could be used to optimally support emergency responses is crucial in order to minimize psychopathology. Unified, clear, trustworthy and informative messaging has a special importance during a mass public health crisis.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether gender equality was correlated with LE in women and men. METHODS: Gender equality in the 27 European Union (EU) member states between 2010 and 2019 was estimated using a modified Gender Equality Index (mGEI), based on the index developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality. The correlation between this mGEI and LE and the gender gap in LE was calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2019, LE increased more for men than women, which resulted in a narrowing of the gender gap in LE in the EU. During the same period, there was an increase in gender equality, as measured by the mGEI, although with substantial heterogeneity between countries. There was a strong correlation between the mGEI and the gender gap in LE (?0.880), which was explained by a stronger correlation between the mGEI and longer LE in men than in women (0.655 vs 0.629, respectively). The domains of the mGEI most strongly associated with a narrowing of the gender gap in LE were health, money and knowledge, while power was the domain with the weakest association.

The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019C20 academic year following the MarchCMay 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement. METHODS: Ninety-seven university teachers (51.5% women; most represented age group 60C69 years range, 40.2%) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 C September 30, 2020, on the advantages and disadvantages of DE, developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbachs alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study. RESULTS: Teachers reported difficulties in technical aspects, and in psychological factors, as the discomfort of speaking in the void (64.7%). The absence of face-to-face eye contact with the students was complained by 81% of teachers. Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported, with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues. A quarter of teachers showed depressive symptoms of varying severity. The most satisfied teachers were those most stimulated by DE (r = 0.752, p < 0.000), who showed a lower impact of depressive symptoms (r = ? 0.289, p = 0.005). The teaching load in hours influenced the perception of disadvantages (r = 0.214, p = 0.035) and contributed to a lower appreciation of the challenges of DE. The more significant the manifestation of depressive symptoms during the lockdown was, the greater the subjective recovery of a good emotional condition once the domestic confinement was over (r = 0.344, p = 0.001), despite maintaining DE. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the impact of technical, didactic, and psychological difficulties of DE, reported by our teachers.

METHODS We conducted a 1-year, hospital-wide, cluster-randomised controlled trial in the inpatient setting at a large tertiary-care academic medical centre. Three CDS types were implemented: monitoring reminders (unknown potassium, no monitoring ordered), elevated potassium warnings (4.9 mEq/l), and hyperkalaemia alerts (5.5 mEq/l). The primary endpoint was the frequency of potassium-monitoring intervals >72 h. RESULTS We analysed 15,272 and 18,981 stays with 2804 and 2057 potassium-increasing DDIs in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Patient-specific notifications: displayed were 869 reminders (1 per 3.2 potassium-increasing DDIs), 356 warnings (1:7.9), and 62 alerts (1:45.2). Nevertheless, insufficiently monitored DDIs were not reduced (intervention 451 of 9686 intervals >72 h [4.66%]; control 249 of 6140 [4.06%]).

Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: 1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; 2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and 3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Results: Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD- scid IL2Rgamma (null) (NSG) background. In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model. In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states. Our data show 1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; 2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; 3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice. Conclusions: hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice. The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.","output":"Development of a Novel Human CD147 Knock-in NSG Mouse Model to Test SARS-CoV-2 Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes host proteases, including a plasma membrane-associated transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to cleave and activate the virus spike protein to facilitate cellular entry. Although TMPRSS2 is a well-characterized type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP), the role of other TTSPs on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be elucidated. Here, we have screened 12 TTSPs using human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing HEK293T (293T-ACE2) cells and Vero E6 cells and demonstrated that exogenous expression of TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13 enhanced cellular uptake and subsequent replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share the same TTSPs in the viral entry process. Our study demonstrates the impact of host TTSPs on infection of SARS-CoV-2, which may have implications for cell and tissue tropism, for pathogenicity, and potentially for vaccine development.","output":"TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13 Activate the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20254-5.","output":"Author Correction: Near-real-time monitoring of global CO2 emissions reveals the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses encoding a polymerase gene (riboviruses) dominate the known eukaryotic virome.

These objectives are organized into 17 SDGs, detailing 169 targets. Different international institutions have emphasized the relevance of education to developing citizens who contribute to achieving the SDGs for 2030. However, a review focused on physical education (PE) has yet to be performed. Therefore, the objective of this work is two-fold. First, to analyze and select the specific SDGs that can be implemented in the area of physical education. Second, to relate these specific goals to the different models based on physical education practices. This review showed how three institutional documents have previously related sport, physical exercise, and physical education to specific SDGs. Based on the search done, this review article selects those goals that could be integrated into the educational context through physical education. The bibliographic and critical analysis in this research shows that of the 169 specific goals proposed in the SDGs, only 24 could be worked on in physical education. Upon completion of the analysis, a proposal for the relationship between the practice-based models and these 24 goals is presented.

Following infection, ICHD patients frequently develop serological evidence of infection, even with asymptomatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the durability and functionality of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICHD patients. Methods Three hundred and fifty-six ICHD patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies. Patients who became seronegative at 6 months were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. Results One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at Time 0, of which 127(98.4%) also had detectable anti-RBD. At 6 months, of 111 patients tested, 71(64.0%) and 97 (87.4%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive respectively, p<0.001. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels reduced significantly after 6 months. Ten patients who were anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive at Time 0, had no detectable antibody at 6 months; of which 8 were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at 6 months, patients with serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at Time 0, were at significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with infection Conclusions ICHD patients mount durable immune responses 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with <3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity. These immune responses are associated with a reduced risk of subsequent reinfection.","output":"Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in haemodialysis patients and protection against reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

The goal of this work was to identify shortcomings in the conventional screening system (CSS) implemented in the beginning of the outbreak. To overcome these shortcomings, we then introduced a novel, independently developed system called the Yeungnam University type drive-through (YU-Thru), and distributed it nationwide in Korea. This system is similar to the drive-throughs utilized by fast food restaurants. YU-Thru system has shortened the time taken to test a single person to 2C4 minutes, by completely eliminating the time required to clean and ventilate the specimen collection room. This time requirement was a major drawback of the CSS. YU-Thru system also reduced the risk of subjects and medical staff infecting one another by using a separate and closed examination system. On average, 50 to 60 tests were conducted per day when using the CSS, while now up to 350 tests per day are conducted with the YU-Thru system. We believe that the YU-Thru system has made an important contribution to the rapid detection of COVID-19 in Daegu, South Korea.

As immune responses are in part regulated by metabolites, we examined whether the serum metabolome has sex-specificity for immune responses in COVID-19. In males with COVID-19, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA to kynurenine (K) ratio was positively correlated with age, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and was negatively correlated with T cell responses, revealing that KA production is linked to immune responses in males. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K ratio than those that stabilized. In females with COVID-19, this ratio positively correlated with T cell responses and did not correlate with age or clinical severity. KA is known to inhibit glutamate release, and we observed that serum glutamate is lower in patients that deteriorate from COVID-19 compared to those that stabilize, and correlates with immune responses. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data revealed that expression of kynurenine aminotransferase, which regulates KA production, correlates most strongly with cytokine levels and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in older males.

Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kininCkallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the reninCangiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we assembled a healthy human lung cell atlas meta-analysis with ~ 130,000 public single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the bradykinin, angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells and associated with their differentiation dynamics, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 receptor is co-expressed with elements of the kininCkallikrein, reninCangiotensin and coagulation systems in alveolar cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the optimal recumbency for laparoscopic ovariectomy (LapOVE) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Sixteen healthy client-owned female dogs undergoing routine single-port LapOVE. METHODS Anesthetized dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency on a tilting operation table. The operating laparoscope was introduced and, after inspection of abdominal organs, directed toward the randomly assigned ovary. Fifteen-second video recordings were taken at each table rotation of 0, 22.5, and 45. LapOVE was performed using the single-port technique. The procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. Blinded observers (3 inexperienced [IO], 3 experienced [EO], 1 expert [EE]) evaluated the recordings postoperatively for visibility of ovary/ovarian bursa, ovario-uterine transition, and other organs. RESULTS In the 0 position, ovarian structures were rarely visualized (IO, 13/96 [13.5%]; EO, 7/96 [7.3%]; EE, 5/32 [15.6%]). In the 22.5 position, visualization improved significantly for EO (26/96 [27.1%], P < .001). There was a marked improvement in visualization for all groups when the positioning angle was altered to 45 (IO, 62/96 [64.6%]; EO, 67/96 [69.8%]; EE, 25/32 [78.1%]). The differences between 0 and 45 and between 22.5 and 45 were significant for all groups of observers (all P < .001). There was an advantage for ovary visualization when procedures were started with left ovariectomy. CONCLUSION The 45 table rotation provided the best ovary visualization, regardless of body side or observer experience.

Family Talk (FT) is a well-known and widely implemented intervention designed to reduce the risk of transgenerational psychopathology. However, given the research to practise gap, very little qualitative research, to date, has investigated practitioner experiences in implementing FT. This study aimed to explore the practitioner-perceived barriers and facilitators to the implementation and sustainability of FT within mainstream mental health settings. Methods: This qualitative study was nested within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Family Talk [N = 86 families (139 parents, 221 children)] within 15 adult (AMHS), child (CAMHS), primary care mental health, and child protection sites in Ireland. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were undertaken with a purposive sample of clinicians (n = 31) and managers (n = 10), based on their experiences of implementing FT. Interview data were transcribed verbatim, analysed using constructivist grounded theory, and informed by Fixsen's implementation science framework. Results: Service providers highlighted a number of benefits for approximately two thirds of families across different diagnoses and mental health settings (AMHS/CAMHS/primary care). Sites varied in their capacity to embed FT, with key enablers identified as acquiring managerial and organisational support, building clinician skill, and establishing interagency collaboration. Implementation challenges included: recruitment difficulties, stresses in working with multiply-disadvantaged families, disruption in delivery due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and sustainability concerns (e.g., perceived fit of FT with organisational remit/capacity, systemic and cultural barriers to change). Conclusion: This study is only the second qualitative study ever conducted to explore practitioner experiences in implementing FT, and the first conducted within the context of an RCT and national research programme to introduce family-focused practise (FFP) for families living with PMI. The findings illuminate the successes and complexities of implementing FFP in a country without a think family infrastructure, whilst highlighting a number of important generalisable lessons for the implementation of FT, and other similar interventions, elsewhere.","output":"A Family-Focused Intervention for Parental Mental Illness: A Practitioner Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper's prime objective is to understand the impact of Shareholder activism on firm performance. This study is conducted in a unique setup where traditional activist investors such as pension funds and hedge funds are not present. However, the activism cases are increasing yearly in an emerging economy like India. We have created a comprehensive shareholder activism index (sha index) using multiple activisms and corporate governance factors. To measure firm performance, we have used valuation (Tobin's Q and Market capitalization), profitability (operating profit margin and net profit margin), and return ratios (Return on capital and return on equity). Panel data analysis (PDA) is employed for the current study as it overcomes the shortcomings of the time series analysis and cross-sectional studies. The sample comprises 37 listed firms' data for FY2017 to FY2020. Chosen firms have experienced activism instances at least once during the 2017C2020 period. As per our analysis, shareholder activism has a significant negative impact on valuation measured in market capitalization and profitability estimated by operating profit margin. Activism primarily impacts the other four parameters negatively, but it is insignificant. India is in the nascent stage of activism, partly explaining the insignificance of the effects of shareholder activism on firm performance. Also, activist investors are targeting companies. These attacks are not fructifying desired outcomes as promoters own over 50% stake in the listed companies. The latest data for FY2021 has not been considered for the study as covid-19 impacted the businesses during the financial year.

One aspect of the countrys global reorientation has been its increased interest in, and willingness to play a role in, global health. In the early 2010s, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) initiated a collaboration with the Chinese government on a programme to support the country to play a greater and more effective global role in health and explore how the UK and China could work together on issues of key concern and contribute to improved global development outcomes. The programme worked with key Chinese agencies to carry out capacity building, support analysis of Chinas approaches to engagement in global health governance and assistance, and provide support to government decision making. It also trialled several small-scale interventions in third countries through which Chinese agencies gained experience of working on health programmes overseas. The article reports on the main findings of an evaluation commissioned by DFID to learn from the programme.

More stakeholders, including residents and entrepreneurs, actively participate in the implementation of alternative socio-economic concepts;as such, entrepreneurial ecosystems are seen as drivers of regional development. The research still lacks holistic approaches to the application of ecosystems in tourism destinations. Hence, the objectives of this article are to capture research on entrepreneurial ecosystems in tourism and, specifically, to derive a holistic model that integrates destination and location management across stakeholders. This research utilizes the method of a systematic literature review, starting with 597 articles on ecosystems. Following four stages of exploring the literature, the results show that most articles have been published in rather isolated fields of smart tourism or quality of life aspects. Based on the rather qualitative review that reveals specific ecosystem components, we propose a model of an Ecosystem of Hospitality (EoH). Focusing on stakeholder interaction and encounters, the EoH fosters the adoption of the entrepreneurial ecosystem to destinations in a dynamic approach. The practical implications are, for example, a broader consideration of various stakeholders, including the local population, and a switch in typical destination management tasks from mere tourism service production to regional development and living space management.","output":"Towards an Ecosystem of Hospitality: The Dynamic Future of Destinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly infects lungs and causes severe, fever, weight loss, chest pain, etc It is an extremely transmittable disease spreaded throughout the world as per the WHO It has emerged as new threat and drug resistance strains of Mycobacterium are emerging throws a challenge to humans health like Covid-19 in current scenario TB is now come in the form of bone TB, which is very difficult to diagnosis due to very slow-growing characteristics of Mycobacterium This review highlights the history, drug development, current treatment both allopathic and Ayurvedic, as well as novel drugs available for the treatment of drug resistance Mycobacterium","output":"An overview on tubularculosis treatment in current scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study bridges the gap between sensory marketing and the use of the internet of things (IoT) in upscale hotels. This paper aims to investigate how stimulating guests senses through IoT devices influenced their emotions, affective experiences, eudaimonism (well-being), and ultimately, guest behavior. The authors examined the potential moderating effects of gender. Design/methodology/approach: Research conducted comprised an exploratory study, which consisted of interviews with hotel managers (Study 1) and an online confirmatory survey (n = 357) among hotel guests (Study 2). Findings: The results showed that while the senses of smell, hearing and sight had an impact on guests emotions, the senses of touch, hearing and sight impacted guests affective experiences. The senses of smell and taste influenced guests eudaimonism. The sense of smell had a greater effect on eudaimonism and behavioral intentions among women compared to men. Research limitations/implications: This study concentrated on upscale hotels located in Europe. Further research may explore the generalizability of the findings (e.g. in other cultures, comparison between high-end and low-end hotels). Practical implications: Managers of upscale hotels should apply congruent sensory stimuli from all five senses. Stimuli may be customized (SoCoIoT marketing). IoT in hotels may be useful in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, as voice commands help guests avoid touching surfaces. Originality/value: IoT can be applied in creating customized multi-sensory hotel experiences. For example, hotels may offer unique and diverse ambiances in their rooms and suites to improve guest experiences. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The internet of things in upscale hotels: its impact on guests sensory experiences and behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Steroids may play a critical role in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), given the dearth of specific therapeutic options.

We investigated whether the proportion of abortions performed medically changed as a result of the introduction of mife/miso, whether using mife/miso instead of the surgical alternative would result in cost savings to the health care system, and whether abortion type differed between patients residing in and outside of Regina. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all 306 medical abortions from the RGH WHC between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018. We obtained medical and surgical abortion information from that year and the preceding one from an administrative database. Statistical methods were used to calculate the costs of mife/miso, methotrexate-misoprostol (MTX/miso) and surgical abortion, as well as cost-effectiveness ratios. Results The proportion of medical abortions increased from 15.4% in 2016/2017 to 28.7% in 2017/2018 (2 1 =54.629; P < 0.001). Calculated costs for mife/miso, with and without complications were CAN$1173.70 and CAN$1708.90, respectively, versus CAN$871.10 and CAN$1204.10, respectively, for MTX/miso, and CAN$1445.95 and CAN$2261.95, respectively, for hospital-based vacuum aspiration. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of CAN$318 (the cost of mife/miso), statistical modelling showed a 61.3% chance that mife/miso was more cost-effective than surgical abortion and a 90.8% chance that it was more cost-effective than MTX/miso. Patients from Regina were significantly more likely (2 1 =29.406; P < 0.001) to receive a medical abortion (34.9% of abortions) than those living outside of Regina (19.6% of abortions).

To date, several manufacturers have made efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In spite of the success of developing many useful vaccines so far, it will be helpful for future vaccine designs, targetting long-term disease protection. For this, we need to know more details of the mechanism of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we first detected pairwise differentially expressed genes among the healthy, mild, and severe COVID-19 groups of patients based on the expression of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells, respectively. The CD4(+) T cells dataset contains 6 mild COVID-19 patients, 8 severe COVID-19 patients, and 6 healthy donors, while the CD8(+) T cells dataset has 15 mild COVID-19 patients, 22 severe COVID-19 patients, and 4 healthy donors. Furthermore, we utilized the deep learning algorithm to investigate the potential of differentially expressed genes in distinguishing different disease states. Finally, we built co-expression networks among those genes separately. For CD4(+) T cells, we identified 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 1 module for the severe network; for CD8(+) T cells, we detected 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 3 modules for the severe network. We also obtained hub genes for each module and evaluated the differential connectivity of each gene between pairs of networks constructed on different disease states. Summarizing the results, we find that the following genes TNF, CCL4, XCL1, and IFITM1 can be highly identified with SARS-CoV-2. It is interesting to see that IFITM1 has already been known to inhibit multiple infections with other enveloped viruses, including coronavirus. In addition, our networks show some specific patterns of connectivity among genes and some meaningful clusters related to COVID-19. The results might improve the insight of gene expression mechanisms associated with both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, expand our understanding of COVID-19 and help develop vaccines with long-term protection.","output":"Unraveling T Cell Responses for Long Term Protection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout, a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress, is a growing concern. It is known to occur when an individual feels overwhelmed, emotionally exhausted, and unable to meet the constant demands imposed upon them. Detecting burnout is not an easy task, in large part because symptoms can overlap with those of other illnesses or syndromes. The use of natural language processing (NLP) methods has the potential to mitigate the limitations of typical burnout detection via inventories. In this article, the performance of NLP methods on anonymized free text data samples collected from the online forum/social media platform Reddit was analyzed. A dataset consisting of 13,568 samples describing first-hand experiences, of which 352 are related to burnout and 979 to depression, was compiled. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning methods in detecting indicators for burnout. Finally, it improves upon standard baseline classifiers by building and training an ensemble classifier using two methods (subreddit and random batching). The best ensemble models attain a balanced accuracy of 0.93, test F1 score of 0.43, and test recall of 0.93.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had self-isolated due to COVID-19. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK (UHBFT). PARTICIPANTS: 956 health care workers were recruited by open invitation via UHBFT trust email and social media. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of their original illness and ethnodemographic variables. RESULTS: Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG, IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2% (n=442/956). The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3%, 18.7% and 8.1% for IgG, IgA and IgM respectively. IgGAM identified serological responses in 40.6% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a positive predictive value of 92.3% for seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assays employing combined antibody detection demonstrate enhanced seroepidemiological sensitivity and can detect prior viral exposure even when PCR swabs have been negative. We demonstrate an association between known ethnodemographic risk factors associated with mortality from COVID-19 and the magnitude of serological responses in mild-to-moderate disease.

Thus, human-to-human transmission has reduced as people's attention to health has increased and precautionary measures have been implemented. It is known that the virus can survive on infected surfaces and hands for hours or days. It is possible to get infected by touching the contaminated surface of food packaging by customers in the grocery and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. Thus, the public supposes that touching food or food packing by salesmen and buyers in the grocery can transmit the virus to the customers. Therefore, the World Health Organization encourages people to wash their hands regularly and disinfect areas where the virus can survive, such as metal and plastic surfaces. However, overwashing can cause disadvantages such as moisture penetration into food packages and increased water activity in food, which provides the conditions for fungi to grow and cause spoilage in food. Accordingly, this phenomenon would have shown significant negative effects on public health as the post-pandemic phase of COVID-19. The coronavirus has had a significant impact on people's behavior in the food chain, washing and disinfecting food in these critical situations. People also quickly changed the way they bought and procured food from supermarkets to ensure food safety and eradicate the virus. Use of substances/disinfectants such as Sodium hypochlorite reduce COVID-19 from surfaces and objects or reduce viral particles from surfaces and objects. Washing and disinfecting food packaging may cause damage to products thereby reducing their shelf life and utilization. Therefore, health experts report public awareness of hands and disinfect surfaces regularly to eliminate the virus.

We hypothesized that coronaviruses could affect pulmonary tissues via integration with the critical immune genes after their interaction with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) elements. The aim of the present bioinformatics study was to assess expression changes of the RAS and non-RAS genes, particularly immune response genes, in the lung epithelial cells after infection with SARS-CoV. METHODS: Linear regression, hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed using the E-GEOD-17400 data set. RESULTS: The whole-genome expression data of the lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV for 12, 24, and 48 hours were analyzed, and a total of 15 RAS family and 29 immune genes were found to be highly correlated with the exposure time to the virus in the studied groups.

METHODS AND RESULTS: HFpEF patients (n = 258) systemically underwent an extensive clinical characterization, including 24-h Holter monitoring and speckle-tracking echocardiography. Patients were categorized according to rhythm and stages of AF: 112 with no history of AF (no AF), 56 with paroxysmal AF (PAF), and 90 with sustained (persistent/permanent) AF (SAF). A progressive decrease in mechanical atrial function was seen: left atrial reservoir strain (LASr) 30.5  10.5% (no AF), 22.3  10.5% (PAF), and 13.9  7.8% (SAF), P < 0.001. Independent predictors for lower LASr values were AF, absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, higher N-terminal-pro hormone B-type natriuretic peptide, left atrial volume index, and relative wall thickness, lower left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and echocardiographic signs of elevated left ventricular filling pressure. LASr was an independent predictor of adverse outcome (hazard ratio per 1% decrease =1.049, 95% confidence interval 1.014C1.085, P = 0.006), whereas AF was not when the multivariable model included LASr. Moreover, LASr mediated the adverse outcome associated with AF in HFpEF (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Mechanical atrial dysfunction has a possible greater prognostic role in HFpEF compared to AF status alone. Mechanical atrial dysfunction is a predictor of adverse outcome independently of AF presence or stage, and may be an underlying mechanism (mediator) for the worse outcome associated with AF in HFpEF. This may suggest mechanical atrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in disease progression in HFpEF patients with AF, and possibly also in HFpEF patients without AF.","output":"The prognostic impact of mechanical atrial dysfunction and atrial fibrillation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research paper proposes a COVID-19 monitoring and response system to identify the surge in the volume of patients at hospitals and shortage of critical equipment like ventilators in South-east Asian countries, to understand the burden on health facilities.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between eating disorders (nutrition attitude) with nutrition knowledge, physical activity level, and COVID-19-related anxiety in female students. Methods The present research was a correlational and causal-comparative study. The statistical population consisted of all female students of Farhangian University of Mashhad (1500 students) in 2021, of whom 247 students were randomly selected. Out of whom, 107 students were active and 140 inactive. Nutrition knowledge, eating disorder, COVID-19-related anxiety, physical activity level, and health-related anthropometric parameters were assessed via the online survey. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, independent t-test, Pearson correlation, and linear regression in SPSS software. Results The results showed that there was a significant difference between active and inactive students in nutrition knowledge (P=0.01), eating disorders (P=0.003), COVID-19-related anxiety, and physical activity level (P=0.001). Additionally, eating disorders correlated significantly with COVID-19-related anxiety and physical activity level (P=0.001). The linear regression results showed that COVID-19-related anxiety could predict eating disorders in female students (P=0.001). Despite a significant negative correlation between eating disorders and physical activity level, the regression model showed that the latter could not predict the former in female students (P>0.05).

A web-based survey was distributed twice to all Norwegian shelters (N = 46): first during the lockdown in spring 2020 and second during the relaxation of infection control measures in summer 2020. The shelters in Norway remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority saw a reduction in the number of requests during the lockdown, while the rates returned to normal when the strictest infection control measures were lifted. They expressed concern about the decline in requests during the lockdown as well as the well-being of some groups, such as victims from ethnic minority backgrounds, children, and victims with additional challenges. A majority of the shelters did not report changes in the content of the requests. Nevertheless, a third of them had observed instances of the virus and/or infection control measures being used by perpetrators as part of the violence and coercive control strategies.

RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 18 published technology-based studies, 6 of which were efficacy trials and the remaining 12 were either pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies. Most (n = 10) interventions were conducted outside the USA, including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 4), China (n = 3), Latin America (n = 2), and India (n = 1). All efficacy trials showed some evidence of efficacy, although uptake of HIV testing was low among in intervention trials that consisted of a low number of text messages. Most pilot RCTs demonstrated high levels of feasibility and acceptability, as well as some evidence that the intervention participants benefited more than the control group. Many non-randomized trials similarly reported positive appraisal by study participants. Recommendations for future research and practice by the authors of the studies reviewed here are summarized. SUMMARY: Technology-assisted HIV testing interventions may be an important strategy to reach national and global targets for HIV status awareness in the general population and for most at-risk groups. Although there appears to be growing evidence of their benefit, questions linger regarding how to leverage existing social media platforms to promote HIV testing, which interventions work for what populations, and best practices for scaling up mHealth and other technology-based interventions.","output":"A Systematic Review of Technology-Assisted HIV Testing Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has radically impacted the world lifestyle. Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. METHODS: Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. RESULTS: 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V: cross-sectional descriptive study.

METHODS: The present study is an observational, correlational, and cross-sectional quantitative study. The participants in the study were pregnant women recruited through non-probabilistic convenience and snowball sampling during the lockdown. A web link was provided to an online questionnaire designed for this research, which collected socio-demographic and obstetric variables, perceptions of health care received during the pandemic and preoccupations associated with COVID-19. It also included the Prenatal Stress Questionnaire (PDQ) and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). RESULTS: Based on the responses of 695 pregnant women, the results showed a mean of 16.98 (SD = 25.20) of prenatal stress and elevated levels of anxiety (M = 25.20/SD = 11.07) in the first wave of the pandemic. Risk factors for prenatal stress and anxiety were the level of preoccupation associated with COVID-19 and previous mental health issues. A specific risk factor for anxiety was having more than one child and a protective factor were perceiving accessibility and availability of health care, with clear and consistent pregnancy care and follow-up protocols.

Ongoing development of novel therapies and combinations strive to improve survival outcomes beyond what is expected from SoC. Belantamab mafodotin (belamaf) is a B-cell maturation antigen-binding antibody-drug conjugate that eliminates myeloma cells by a multimodal mechanism and has demonstrated durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Preclinical evidence of belamaf in combination with bortezomib or lenalidomide suggests enhanced anti-myeloma activity, providing rationale for this treatment combination. We report the preliminary findings of belamaf + VRd for TI NDMM patients. Methods: DREAMM-9 (NCT04091126) is an ongoing Phase I, open-label, randomized, dose and schedule evaluation study of belamaf + VRd in patients with TI NDMM. Eligible patients include those 18 years old with ECOG status 0-2 and adequate organ system functions. The study evaluates safety and tolerability of belamaf + VRd in up to 8 cohorts, up to 144 patients, to establish the recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D). VRd is administered Q3W until cycle 8, followed by lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd) Q4W. Belamaf + VRd is administered until cycle 8, and then in combination with Rd thereafter. The belamaf dose cohorts currently being evaluated are: cohort 1 (1.9 mg/kg Q3/4W), cohort 2 (1.4 mg/kg Q6/8W), cohort 3 (1.9 mg/kg Q6/8W), cohort 4 (1.0 mg/kg Q3/4W), and cohort 5 (1.4 mg/kg Q3/4W). After evaluation of safety data for cohort 1, cohorts 2-5 were opened in parallel and enrolled patients were randomized 1:1:1:1. Safety data, clinical activity, and drug concentrations will be assessed, and used to determine the belamaf RP3D. This analysis reports the preliminary results from cohort 1. Primary endpoints include number of patients with adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints include establishing relative dose intensity of lenalidomide and bortezomib in combination with belamaf, cumulative dose of belamaf, pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of belamaf when combined with VRd, overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), stringent complete response (sCR), complete response rate ([CRR];% of patients with a confirmed CR or better), and rate of very good partial response or better (VGPR). Exploratory endpoints include assessing minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who achieve VGPR, and safety and efficacy exposure-response relationships. Results: Twelve patients in cohort 1 were included in this preliminary analysis. Eight patients (67%) were male;median age (range) was 72.5 years (63-77). Ten patients (83%) were white and 2 (17%) were Asian. Nine patients (75%), were ISS stage II or III, and 4 (33%) patients had high-risk cytogenetics (consisting of one or more of the following: t(4;14), t(14;16), del17p, 17p13del). AEs related to study treatment were experienced by all 12 patients. Dose reductions occurred in 12 (100%) patients, all of whom also experienced a dose delay. Most common AEs leading to dose modification were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and corneal events. Grade 3 or 4 AEs related to belamaf occurred in 9 (75%) patients. During the trial, one patient experienced a fatal severe AE due to COVID-19 infection (unrelated to study treatment;Table). All patients, 100% (n=12;95% CI: 73.5-100) achieved VGPR. Early deep responses were observed;2 (17%) patients achieved VGPR as early as 4 weeks. As of data cut-off, 5 (42%) remain in CR and 3 (25%) in sCR. Based on real-time data captured in the clinical database, 7 out of 9 patients achieved MRD-negative status at the first test after VGPR. Belamaf PK profile was similar to that observed in patients with RRMM taking into consideration baseline patients characteristics. Conclusion: Preliminary data suggest addition of belamaf to VRd did not reveal new safety signals and demonstrates high response rates, albeit with short follow up. The study is ongoing to confirm safety and evaluate the efficacy of belamaf + VRd. Updated data for cohort 1 will be reported at the congress.

METHODS: This study included 50 eyes of 25 patients who had been hospitalized for PCR-positive COVID-19 infection and 50 eyes of 25 healthy individuals. All subjects underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) using a 6  6 macular protocol in the early period after hospital discharge and 6 months later. Foveal vessel density (VD) and parafoveal VD values were measured from 4 quadrants (superior, inferior, nasal, temporal) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP). Choriocapillaris (CC) flow area and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were also measured. The OCT-A measurements of the patient group were compared both between time points and with the control group at each time point. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed lower VD values than control subjects in all parafoveal quadrants of both the SCP (superior, p=0.01; inferior, p=0.048; nasal, p=0.003; temporal, p=0.048) and the DCP (superior, p=0.001; inferior, p=0.011; nasal, p=0.012; temporal, p=0.018) at the initial checkup and in all parafoveal quadrants of the SCP (superior, p=0.0001; inferior, p=0.007; nasal, p=0.001; temporal, p=0.017) and in 2 of the parafoveal quadrants of the DCP (superior, p=0.003; inferior, p=0.016) at the 6-month follow-up.

Therefore, investigating the effects of purple seed stain (PSS) on seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (nutrition) is critical. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PSS on seed harvest index, seed germination, seed vigor, and seed composition components (protein, oil, fatty acids, and sugars). A field experiment was initiated in 2019 in Stoneville, MS, at the Delta Research and Extension Center (DREC) on a Commerce silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Fluventic Epiaquepts). Soybean variety Credenz 4748 LL was used. The results showed that infected (symptomatic) seed had a 5.5% greater Seed Index (based on 100 seed weight) when compared to non-infected (non-symptomatic, as control) seed. Non-infected seed had greater percent germination and seedling vigor when compared to infected seed. Germination was 30.9% greater and vigor was 58.3% greater in non-infected seed. Also, the results showed that infected seed with PSS had higher protein content and some amino acids. No changes in total oil and fatty acids. Sucrose and stachyose were lower in infected seed than in non-infected seed. The research showed that PSS impacted seed health and seed quality (germination and vigor) and seed composition (protein, sugars, and some amino acids). Purple stained seed should be avoided when planting and should be managed properly as low germination is a potential risk. Planting population should be adjusted accordingly due to lack of germination and vigor if PSS is present.

However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating the predictive value of clinical symptoms for paediatric COVID-19. This gap in evidence is significant as frontline healthcare settings use clinical symptoms to determine infection control policy and patient cohorting measures.Despite studies showing that children have a mild illness, the risk of children with comorbidities and other clinical vulnerabilities contracting COVID-19 remains poorly defined.Objectives? To determine the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity.? To assess the co-relation of demographic characteristics, clinical co-morbidities and vulnerabilities with SARS-CoV-2 positivity.MethodsRetrospective single-centre observational study of children with suspected COVID-19 who underwent SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on admission to a specialist childrens hospital in the United Kingdom. Data was collected from electronic patient records from 17/03/2020 to 14/04/2020.Results210 children, aged 0C16 years, median age of 2.5 years (Interquartile range 0.7C7.0) were included. 29 (14%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. A higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive children were male (62% vs 50%, p=0.24) and at the extremes of age (below 6 months and above 10 years).SARS-CoV-2 positive group had a higher incidence of diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and seizures whereas cough was seen more frequently in the SARS-CoV-2 negative group. Proportions of children presenting with any respiratory symptoms was similar in both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative groups. Sensitivity of clinical symptoms individually or in combination in predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 70% or lower. Specificity for predicting SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more than 80% for wheeze, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting, reduced feeds, fever, lethargy, rash and headache.There were significantly more children of Black, Asian and Minority ethnic (BAME) groups in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (72% [21/29] vs 46% [84/181], p=0.009).Proportions of children with comorbidities in both SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative groups were similar;48% (14/29) vs 54% (97/181) respectively (p=0.59). The commonest comorbidity in this study cohort were respiratory conditions, followed by neurological and oncological conditions.The proportion of children who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive was similar between the clinically vulnerable and non-vulnerable groups. (13.5% [7/52] vs 13.9% [22/158];p=0.85).ConclusionsIn our study cohort, there was no single symptom or cluster of symptoms predictive of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The only association that we found with SARS-CoV-2 positivity was belonging to a BAME group. Having comorbidities or being clinically vulnerable did not increase the likelihood of a children being SARS-CoV-2 positive.As presenting symptoms are not accurately predictive of SARS-CoV-2 detection, our study suggests that cohorting children based on clinical symptoms alone, could potentially increase the risk of transmission of infection within healthcare facilities. Until rapid and accurate point-of-care testing is widely available, a shift of emphasis from symptom-based cohorting towards measures such as physical distancing and use of face coverings, will enable better protection.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of presenting symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2-positivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose an equilibrium-driven deformation algorithm (EDDA) to simulate the inbetweening transformations starting from an initial image to an equilibrium image, which covers images varying from a greyscale type to a colorful type on plane or manifold.

Online delivery of mindfulness-based therapy for insomnia (MBTI) has not previously been evaluated. This study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a digital MBTI program for improving insomnia symptoms. It was hypothesized that a 6-week digital MBTI program would reduce insomnia symptoms and pre-sleep arousal and improve mood, compared to a waitlist control condition. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants (M = 29.44, SD = 11.97 years) experiencing insomnia symptoms (insomnia severity index [ISI]  8) were randomized to either a 6-week intervention or waitlist condition. Participants completed the ISI, pre-sleep arousal scale (PSAS), and the positive and negative affect schedule at baseline, mid-, and post-study. Feasibility was assessed across four domains (acceptability, implementation, practicality, and preliminary efficacy) using self-reports, attrition, program completions, and module completions. RESULTS: Feasibility data for the intervention indicated that there was 22% attrition, and 79% of the modules were completed. There were significantly greater reductions in the severity of insomnia symptoms (p < .001) and both cognitive (p = .03) and somatic (p = .02) subscales of the PSAS, at post-intervention compared to the waitlist group. There were no significant group differences in mood.

We have been running virtual cardiology clinics as per Health Service Executive guidance. AIMS: Our study aims to determine how virtual clinics change practice vs traditional clinics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on patients attending cardiology clinics in our hospital from 6 January to 13 March 2020 (traditional clinic, n = 1644), compared with clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak, from 16 March to 22 April 2020 (virtual clinic, n = 691), with the same medical staff. RESULTS: There was no difference in age (61 vs 60), case mix or new vs return appointments in virtual vs traditional clinics. There were similar rates of clinic participation, 71.8% vs 74.2%. A lower proportion of investigations (e.g. imaging) were booked in virtual (38.5%) vs traditional (55.7%) clinics, p < 0.00001. Management changes (e.g. medication changes) were less frequent in virtual (19.9%) vs traditional (38.5%) clinics, p < 0.00001. However, the discharge rate was higher in virtual (28.8%) vs traditional (19.5%) clinics, p = 0.00003. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that virtual clinic consultations are associated with fewer investigations, fewer management changes, and increased discharge rates compared with traditional consultations. These practice changes would reduce costs and hospital outpatient congestion by avoiding unnecessary hospital reviews. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether patients requiring face-to-face consultations could be missed as a result of this virtual approach.

Here we examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive loss of function through the lens of population genomics and consider the challenges and opportunities of studying adaptive loss-of-function alleles using population genetics models. We discuss how the theoretically expected existence of allelic heterogeneity, defined as multiple functionally analogous mutations at the same locus, has proven consistent with empirical evidence and why this impedes both the detection of selection and causal relationships with phenotypes. We then review technical progress towards new functionally explicit population genomic tools and genotype-phenotype methods to overcome these limitations.

Herein, we describe a new mock circuit that enables experimental ECCO(2)R research without animal models. In a second step, we use this model to investigate three experimental scenarios of ECCO(2)R: (I) the influence of hemoglobin concentration on CO(2) removal. (II) a potentially portable ECCO(2)R that uses air instead of oxygen, (III) a low-flow ECCO(2)R that achieves effective CO(2) clearance by recirculation and acidification of the limited blood volume of a small dual lumen cannula (such as a dialysis catheter). RESULTS: With the presented ECCO(2)R mock, CO(2) removal rates comparable to previous studies were obtained. The mock works with either fresh porcine blood or diluted expired human packed red blood cells. However, fresh porcine blood was preferred because of better handling and availability. In the second step of this work, hemoglobin concentration was identified as an important factor for CO(2) removal. In the second scenario, an air-driven ECCO(2)R setup showed only a slightly lower CO(2) wash-out than the same setup with pure oxygen as sweep gas. In the last scenario, the low-flow ECCO(2)R, the blood flow at the test membrane lung was successfully raised with a recirculation channel without the need to increase cannula flow. Low recirculation ratios resulted in increased efficiency, while high recirculation ratios caused slightly reduced CO(2) removal rates. Acidification of the CO(2) depleted blood in the recirculation channel caused an increase in CO(2) removal rate. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a simple and cost effective, yet powerful, in-vitro ECCO(2)R model that can be used as an alternative to animal experiments for many research scenarios.

Evidence of neutrophil dysfunction in COVID-19 is based predominantly on transcriptomics or single functional assays. Cell functions are interwoven pathways, and so understanding the effect of COVID-19 across the spectrum of neutrophil function may identify tractable therapeutic targets. Objectives: Examine neutrophil phenotype and functional capacity in COVID-19 patients versus age-matched controls (AMC) Methods: Isolated neutrophils from 41 hospitalised, non-ICU COVID-19 patients and 23 AMC underwent ex vivo analyses for migration, bacterial phagocytosis, ROS generation, NET formation (NETosis) and cell surface receptor expression. DNAse 1 activity was measured, alongside circulating levels of cfDNA, MPO, VEGF, IL-6 and sTNFRI. All measurements were correlated to clinical outcome. Serial sampling on day 3-5 post hospitalisation were also measured. Results: Compared to AMC, COVID-19 neutrophils demonstrated elevated transmigration (p=0.0397) and NETosis (p=0.0366), but impaired phagocytosis (p=0.0236) associated with impaired ROS generation (p<0.0001). Surface expression of CD54 (p<0.0001) and CD11c (p=0.0008) was significantly increased and CD11b significantly decreased (p=0.0229) on COVID-19 patient neutrophils. COVID-19 patients showed increased systemic markers of NETosis including increased cfDNA (p=0.0153) and impaired DNAse activity (p<0.0.001).

Background: The effectiveness of the measures battling the pandemic was largely determined by the voluntary compliance of the public. Objectives: This study aimed to identify psychological perception factors related to the appraisal of individual measures and endorsement of public health measures during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese living in Canada. Methods: A convenience sample of 656 participants completed an online survey. Nonparametric Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare COVID perception variables (e.g., perceived susceptibility, fear, perceived severity, and information confusion) among different sociodemographic subgroups. Bootstrapped regression models were used to assess the association of these variables with outcome measures. Results: Compared to their counterpart groups, lower perceived susceptibility was reported by adults 65 years and older (p = .002) or retired (p = .015);greater fear was reported by females (p = .044), those with lower education (p = .001), and Mainland Chinese (p = .033);greater perceived severity was reported by individuals with lower education and smaller household size (ps = .003). Perceived susceptibility was inversely associated with individual measure appraisal (p = .032). Perceived severity was positively associated with individual measure appraisal (p = .005) and public measure endorsement (p < .001). Conclusion: Individual behaviour measure appraisal was predicted by lower perceived susceptibility and higher perceived severity, whereas public health measure endorsement was related to higher perceived severity.

A sub-sample also participated in a third assessment (T3-December 2020). Participants completed questionnaires assessing their emotional and psychological functioning (i.e., positive and negative affect, perceived social and emotional loneliness, resilience) along with memory tasks (Backward Digit Span task and words list recall). Results: Although individuals reported less positive and more negative emotions during the lockdown than at T2, results showed that older adults displayed overall fewer negative emotions and greater resilience than young adults. The latter were those who reported feeling more emotionally lonely when compared to their older counterpart during the lockdown than afterward. Older adults advantage in emotional and psychological functioning was also confirmed 7 months after the national lockdown. Only age-related differences in favor of young adults for the memory tasks were found. The measures of interest were also susceptible to mood and/or concerns of COVID-19 effects.

We aimed to develop and implement a remotely delivered pain management programme (PMP) using video-conferencing technology that contains all the core components of a full programme: the virtual PMP (vPMP). By reporting on the process of this development, we endeavour to help address the paucity of literature on the development of remote pain management programmes. METHODS: The vPMP was developed by an inter-disciplinary group of professionals as a quality improvement (QI) project. The Model for Improvement Framework was employed with patient involvement at the design phase and at subsequent improvements. Improvement was measured qualitatively with frequent and repeated qualitative data collection leading to programme change. Quantitative patient demographic comparisons were made with a patient cohort who had been on a face-to-face PMP pathway. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients on the PMP waiting list were contacted and 43 met the criteria for the programme. Fourteen patients participated in three vPMP cycles. Patient involvement and comprehensive stakeholder consultation were essential to a robust design for the first vPMP. Continued involvement of patient partners during the QI process led to rapid resolution of implementation problems. The most prominent issues that needed action were technical challenges including training needs, participant access to physical and technological resources, participant fatigue and concerns about adequate communication and peer support. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates how a remotely delivered PMP, fully in line with national guidance, was rapidly developed and implemented in a hospital setting for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) showed outstanding CL properties, superior to ABEI-CuFe(2)O(4) in liquid phase. This reveals that the immobilization of ABEI on the surface of CuFe(2)O(4) exhibits unique heterogeneous catalytic property. The catalytic ability of CuFe(2)O(4) was better than that of CoFe(2)O(4), ZnFe(2)O(4), MnFe(2)O(4), and NiFe(2)O(4). It is suggested that the peroxide-like activity as well as Cu(2+) and Cu(0) enriched on the surface of ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) opened up a dual route for synergistic catalysis of H(2)O(2). ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) also demonstrated good superparamagnetism and magnetic separation could be carried out in 2 min, which is advantageous for the separation and purification of ABEI/CuFe(2)O(4) during the synthetic procedures and bioassays.

Healthcare workers (HCW) are a critical workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic but are themselves often at increased risk of infection. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 attack rate and risk factors among frontline HCWs. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of HCW serving two acute care hospitals in Lima, Peru from Aug 2020 to Mar 2021. Participants had baseline SARS-CoV-2 serology using the CDC ELISA, active symptom monitoring, and weekly respiratory specimen collection with COVID-19 exposure/risk assessment for 16-weeks regardless of symptoms. Respiratory specimens were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Results Of 783 eligible, 667 (85%) HCW were enrolled (33% nurse assistants, 29% non-clinical staff, 26% nurses, 7% physicians, and 6% other). At baseline and prior to COVID-19 vaccine introduction, 214 (32.1%;214/667) were reactive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In total, 72 (10.8%;72/667) HCWs were found to be rRT-PCR positive during weekly follow-up. Of the rRT-PCR positive HCWs, 37.5% (27/72) did not report symptoms within 1-week of specimen collection. During follow up, HCW without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline were significantly more likely to be rRT-PCR positive (65/453, 14.3%) compared to those with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline (4/214, 1.9%) (p-value: < 0.001). Three HCW were both serologically reactive and rRT-PCR positive at baseline. Looking only at HCW without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, nurse assistants (rRT-PCR positive: 18.6%;27/141) and non-clinical healthcare workers (16.5%;21/127) were at greater risk of infection compared to nurses (8.5%;10/118), physicians (7.9%;3/38), and other staff (10.3%;4/29) (RR 1.95;95%CI 1.2,3.3;p-value: 0.01). Conclusion Baseline SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and 16-week cumulative incidence were substantial in this pre-vaccination Peruvian HCW cohort. Almost 40% of new infections occurred in HCW without complaint of symptoms illustrating a limitation of symptom-based HCW screening for COVID-19 prevention.

Since the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based consensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic Proof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but also quantifies the node's behavior based on its underlying credit-based mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures, and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor measurements.

In the present study, the 6-deoxyheptan capsular polysaccharide (CPS) from B. pseudomallei was purified, chemically activated, and covalently linked to recombinant CRM197 diphtheria toxin mutant (CRM197) to produce CPS-CRM197. Additionally, tandem nickel-cobalt affinity chromatography was used to prepare highly purified recombinant B. pseudomallei Hcp1 and TssM proteins.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus might lead to characteristic patterns in the results of widely available, routine blood tests that could be identified with machine learning methodologies. Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments. METHODS: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged &#8805;20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%. At the cutoff of 2.0, the NPVs at a prevalence of 1%, 10%, and 20% were 99.9%, 98.6%, and 97%, respectively.

Misinformation has real consequences for consumer health search, i.e., users searching for health information. In the context of multi-stage ranking architectures, there has been little work exploring whether they prioritize correct and credible information over misinformation. We find that, indeed, training models on standard relevance ranking datasets like MS MARCO passage - -which have been curated to contain mostly credible information - -yields models that might also promote harmful misinformation. To rectify this, we propose a label prediction technique that can separate helpful from harmful content. Our design leverages pretrained sequence-to-sequence transformer models for both relevance ranking and label prediction.

The relationships among natural organisms, depicted in the shape of phylogenetic trees, not only help to understand evolutionary history but also have a wide range of additional applications in science. One of the most challenging problems that arise when building phylogenetic trees is the presence of missing biological data. More specifically, the possibility of inferring wrong phylogenetic trees increases proportionally to the amount of missing values in the input data. Although there are methods proposed to deal with this issue, their applicability and accuracy is often restricted by different constraints. RESULTS: We propose a framework, called PhyloMissForest, to impute missing entries in phylogenetic distance matrices and infer accurate evolutionary relationships. PhyloMissForest is built upon a random forest structure that infers the missing entries of the input data, based on the known parts of it. PhyloMissForest contributes with a robust and configurable framework that incorporates multiple search strategies and machine learning, complemented by phylogenetic techniques, to provide a more accurate inference of lost phylogenetic distances. We evaluate our framework by examining three real-world datasets, two DNA-based sequence alignments and one containing amino acid data, and two additional instances with simulated DNA data. Moreover, we follow a design of experiments methodology to define the hyperparameter values of our algorithm, which is a concise method, preferable in comparison to the well-known exhaustive parameters search. By varying the percentages of missing data from 5% to 60%, we generally outperform the state-of-the-art alternative imputation techniques in the tests conducted on real DNA data. In addition, significant improvements in execution time are observed for the amino acid instance. The results observed on simulated data also denote the attainment of improved imputations when dealing with large percentages of missing data. CONCLUSIONS: By merging multiple search strategies, machine learning, and phylogenetic techniques, PhyloMissForest provides a highly customizable and robust framework for phylogenetic missing data imputation, with significant topological accuracy and effective speedups over the state of the art.

We assessed perceived hesitation to provide a response, item importance and relevance, understanding of specific items and factors affecting responses. RESULTS Hesitation to provide a categorical answer was reported by 20% of subjects or more, for 5/24 (20.8%) items. Uncertainty was most frequent for \\"travel by public transport\\" (22.4%) and \\"catch an object (e.g. ball)\\" (24%).

Items most commonly perceived as unimportant were \\"travel by public transport\\" in 53.7%, \\"catch an object e.g. ball\\" in 61%, \\"dance\\" in 65.9%. Several items were frequently perceived as irrelevant. These included \\"move a chair\\" (39%), \\"do the dishes\\" (46.3%), \\"catch an object e.g. ball\\" (61%), \\"travel by public transport\\" (68.3%), and \\"stand for hours\\" (82.9%).

This is especially true in pathological conditions, hindering the clinical application of aeration compartment (AC) analysis. Deep learning based algorithms have lately been shown to be reliable and time-efficient in segmenting pathologic lungs. In this contribution, we thus propose a novel 3D transfer learning based approach to quantify lung volumes, aeration compartments and lung recruitability. METHODS: Two convolutional neural networks developed for biomedical image segmentation (uNet), with different resolutions and fields of view, were implemented using Matlab. Training and evaluation was done on 180 scans of 18 pigs in experimental ARDS (u2Net(Pig)) and on a clinical data set of 150 scans from 58 ICU patients with lung conditions varying from healthy, to COPD, to ARDS and COVID-19 (u2Net(Human)). One manual segmentations (MS) was available for each scan, being a consensus by two experts. Transfer learning was then applied to train u2Net(Pig) on the clinical data set generating u2Net(Transfer). General segmentation quality was quantified using the Jaccard index (JI) and the Boundary Function score (BF). The slope between JI or BF and relative volume of non-aerated compartment (S(JI) and S(BF), respectively) was calculated over data sets to assess robustness toward non-aerated lung regions. Additionally, the relative volume of ACs and lung volumes (LV) were compared between automatic and MS. RESULTS: On the experimental data set, u2Net(Pig) resulted in JI = 0.892 [0.88 : 091] (median [inter-quartile range]), BF = 0.995 [0.98 : 1.0] and slopes S(JI) = ?0.2 {95% conf. int. ?0.23 : ?0.16} and S(BF) = ?0.1 {?0.5 : ?0.06}. u2Net(Human) showed similar performance compared to u2Net(Pig) in JI, BF but with reduced robustness S(JI) = ?0.29 {?0.36 : ?0.22} and S(BF) = ?0.43 {?0.54 : ?0.31}. Transfer learning improved overall JI = 0.92 [0.88 : 0.94], P < 0.001, but reduced robustness S(JI) = ?0.46 {?0.52 : ?0.40}, and affected neither BF = 0.96 [0.91 : 0.98] nor S(BF) = ?0.48 {?0.59 : ?0.36}. u2Net(Transfer) improved JI compared to u2Net(Human) in segmenting healthy (P = 0.008), ARDS (P < 0.001) and COPD (P = 0.004) patients but not in COVID-19 patients (P = 0.298). ACs and LV determined using u2Net(Transfer) segmentations exhibited < 5% volume difference compared to MS. CONCLUSION: Compared to manual segmentations, automatic uNet based 3D lung segmentation provides acceptable quality for both clinical and scientific purposes in the quantification of lung volumes, aeration compartments, and recruitability.","output":"Automatic Lung Segmentation and Quantification of Aeration in Computed Tomography of the Chest Using 3D Transfer Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combined impacts of COVID-19 and global climate change are destabilising the infrastructures and future prospects of formal educational systems, with schools and universities struggling to adapt to conditions of radical precarity.

In addition, the rough spatial resolution of traditional nighttime light (NTL) data has limited their fine application in current small-scale population distribution research. For the purpose of studying the spatial distribution of populations at the urban scale, we proposed a new index (i.e., the road network adjusted human settlement index, RNAHSI) by integrating Luojia 1-01 (LJ 1-01) NTL data, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and road network density (RND) data based on population density relationships to depict the spatial distribution of urban human settlements. The RNAHSI updated the high-resolution NTL data and combined the RND data on the basis of human settlement index (HSI) data to refine the spatial pattern of urban population distribution. The results indicated that the mean relative error (MRE) between the population estimation data based on the RNAHSI and the demographic data was 34.80%, which was lower than that in the HSI and WorldPop dataset. This index is suitable primarily for the study of urban population distribution, as the RNAHSI can clearly highlight human activities in areas with dense urban road networks and can refine the spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas. In addition, we also drew a population density map of the city of Shenzhen with a 100 m spatial resolution for 2018 based on the RNAHSI, which has great reference significance for urban management and urban resource allocation.","output":"An Improved Method of Determining Human Population Distribution Based on Luojia 1-01 Nighttime Light Imagery and Road Network DataA Case Study of the City of Shenzhen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We perform a panel data analysis of 14 daily stock market indices during 01/21/2020C06/30/2020 to document a stock market indexs negative responsiveness to Covid-19s spread variations.

Next-generation industrial filters and masks should retain sufficiently small droplets and aerosols while having low resistance.

The structures are tested for pressure drop and particle filtering efficiency over different airflow rates. We have also cross-validated the observed efficiency through numerical simulations.

Summary Introduction Although less frequent than viral induced recurrent cough; chronic cough remains a sometimes difficult to resolve diagnostic tool. State of the art Most authors estimate that a cough can by considered as chronic after three weeks of duration. Few papers have been published concerning etiologic diagnosis of chronic cough in childhood but these indicate the same main causes as in adults: cough variant asthma, postnasal drip syndrome, gastro-eosophageal reflux. Nevertheless, each age bracket presents specific diagnosis : malformations between zero and one year, psychogenic cough in adolescents. Perspectives New techniques as induced sputum studies helps to reifine chronic cough diagnosis in childhood (after 7 years). Eosinophilic bronchitis, associated or not to bronchial hyperresponsiveness has important therapeutic consequences because associated with a favourable response to corticosteroids. Other techniques will be developped in the future (exhaled NO for example). Conclusions Chronic cough in childhood must be investigated from an anatomic point of view and on frequency arguments.

The objective of the present study is to find acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for children among mothers. Materials and Method: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among mothers of children 2-12 years residing in a village of field practice area of Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, Chengalpet district. A pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire was used. Vaccine hesitancy was scored with the Likert scale. The data collected was entered and analysed with SPSS IBM version 22.0. Results: Among the study participants, the majority of the mothers 121 (90%) had more than 4 visits during their antenatal period. Institutional deliveries 124 (92%) were reported by mothers. The majority of the children 114 (82%) were fully vaccinated as per the immunisation schedule. Few of the mothers 46 (34.3%) reported that adults in the family are yet to be completely vaccinated for COVID-19. 13 (10%) of the mothers reported that there was a COVID-19 related death in the family or neighbourhood. Among the mothers, 50 (37%) had COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and were not willing to vaccinate their children.

This study aims to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic is a blessing or a curse for women entrepreneurs in Pakistans informal sector. The influence of business type, family support and other socio-economic factors on the sales volume of womens businesses is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 400 women entrepreneurs using a survey questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relationships between perceived sales volume and socio-economic as well as demographic factors of women entrepreneurs. Findings: Findings for RQ1 revealed that the pandemic was a blessing for cloth and cosmetic entrepreneurs, but a curse for those women selling dairy products. Results for RQ2 showed that age, homeownership, household size, family support and type of business were significant predictors of sales. Furthermore, women entrepreneurs were greatly influenced by their familys desires and decisions, such that women entrepreneurs who received support from families and relatives reported higher sales than those who did not receive such support. Practical implications: The results may assist policymakers in designing supportive programs to encourage womens informal entrepreneurial activities. Creating entrepreneurial ecosystems may provide support for women entrepreneurs beyond family support. The findings provide a better understanding of womens business effectiveness during COVID-19 pandemic. It reveals the resilience of women entrepreneurs in the face of cultural, economic and institutional constraints encountered during the pandemic. Originality/value: This study is unique because it focuses on the impact of the pandemic at the household level rather than examining broad macroeconomic scenarios.

The high level of mutations of the IB virus (IBV) leads to the emergence of new serotypes and genotypes, and limits the efficacy of routine prevention. Medicinal plants, or substances derived from them, are being tested as options in the prevention of infectious diseases such as IB in many countries. The objective of this study was to investigate extracts of 15 selected medicinal plants for anti-IBV activity. RESULTS: Extracts of S. montana, O. vulgare, M. piperita, M. officinalis, T. vulgaris, H. officinalis, S. officinalis and D. canadense showed anti-IBV activity prior to and during infection, while S. montana showed activity prior to and after infection. M. piperita, O. vulgare and T. vulgaris extracts had > 60 SI. In further studies no virus plaques (plaque reduction rate 100%) or cytopathogenic effect (decrease of TCID(50) from 2.0 to 5.0 log(10)) were detected after IBV treatment with extracts of M. piperita, D. canadense and T. vulgaris at concentrations of extracts 0.25 cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) (P < 0.05). Both PFU number and TCID(50) increased after the use of M. piperita, D. canadense, T. vulgaris and M. officinalis extracts, the concentrations of which were 0.125 CC(50) and 0.25 CC(50) (P < 0.05).

Detecting smoking activity accurately among the confounding activities of daily living (ADLs) being monitored by the wearable device is a challenging and intriguing research problem. This study aims to develop a machine learning based modeling framework to identify the smoking activity among the confounding ADLs in real-time using the streaming data from the wrist-wearable IMU (6-axis inertial measurement unit) sensor. A low-cost wrist-wearable device has been designed and developed to collect raw sensor data from subjects for the activities. A sliding window mechanism has been used to process the streaming raw sensor data and extract several time-domain, frequency-domain, and descriptive features. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection have been done to identify best hyperparameters and features respectively. Subsequently, multi-class classification models are developed and validated using in-sample and out-of-sample testing. The developed models obtained predictive accuracy (area under receiver operating curve) up to 98.7% for predicting the smoking activity. The findings of this study will lead to a novel application of wearable devices to accurately detect smoking activity in real-time. It will further help the healthcare professionals in monitoring their patients who are smokers by providing just-in-time intervention to help them quit smoking.

Moreover, quantifying social contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly evolving pandemic intervened by changing public health measures is key for retroactive evaluation and proactive assessment of the effectiveness of different age- and setting-specific interventions. Contact mixing patterns have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic public health decision-making; but a rigorously justified methodology to identify setting-specific contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly developing pandemic, which can be informed by readily available data, is in great demand and has not yet been established. Here we fill in this critical gap by developing and utilizing a novel methodology, integrating social contact patterns derived from empirical data with a disease transmission model, that enables the usage of age-stratified incidence data to infer age-specific susceptibility, daily contact mixing patterns in workplace, household, school and community settings; and transmission acquired in these settings under different physical distancing measures. We demonstrated the utility of this methodology by performing an analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We quantified the age- and setting (household, workplace, community, and school)-specific mixing patterns and their evolution during the escalation of public health interventions in Ontario, Canada. We estimated a reduction in the average individual contact rate from 12.27 to 6.58 contacts per day, with an increase in household contacts, following the implementation of control measures. We also estimated increasing trends by age in both the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of symptomatic individuals diagnosed. Inferring the age- and setting-specific social contact mixing and key age-stratified epidemiological parameters, in the presence of evolving control measures, is critical to inform decision- and policy-making for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Quantifying the shift in social contact patterns in response to non-pharmaceutical interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Irrigating a surgical wound with an antiseptic solution is commonly performed while suturing following a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to help prevent wound complications. The purpose of this study was to: 1) evaluate the mean load to failure of different sutures, and 2) compare the mean load to failure of the sutures after soaking in four different antiseptic solutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Load-to-failure tests were conducted on four sets of comparable sutures (eight sutures) from two different companies Ethicon Inc. (Somerville, New Jersey) and Covidien (Mansfield, Massachusetts). The four suture types included: 1) non-absorbable braided polyethylene, 2) absorbable braided glycolide or lactide polymer, 3) absorbable monofilament polydioxanone or polyglyconate, and 4) absorbable monofilament polyglecaprone or gylcomer. Sutures were tested for tensile strength at baseline (i.e., no solution; n=5 per suture), and were then soaked for five minutes in one of four different antiseptic solutions: 0.125% sodium hypochlorite, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, 10% povidone-iodine, and a 1:1 ratio of 3% hydrogen peroxide and sterile water. Effects of the different solutions on individual sutures were assessed with analysis of variance, and pairwise comparison tests were performed with post-hoc Tukey tests. RESULTS For the controls, the mean failure loads for the type 1 sutures were 118.5 N and 120.3 N, for the type 2 sutures, 145.8 N and 155.4 N, the type 3 sutures, 103.8 N and 162.2 N, and the type 4 sutures, 86.9 N and 87.7 N. After being soaked in sodium hypochlorite, the mean failure load decreased for one of the type 2 sutures (mean difference, -12.8 N;p=0.003), while the other type 2 suture had a decreased failure load after soaking in povidone-iodine (mean difference, -10.3 N;p=0.041) and hydrogen peroxide (mean difference, -14.6 N;p=0.001). A type 1 suture had an increased load to failure after soaking in povidone-iodine (mean difference, 13.2 N;p<0.0001) and hydrogen peroxide (mean difference, 10.5 N;p<0.0001).

Apart from influenza, there are no vaccines and very few antiviral chemotherapeutic agents available for the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections-the most common cause of human illness. If the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreak ever assumes the role of a pandemic, formidable technical difficulties relating to the properties of the agent, itself, will ensure that vaccines will only become available after a significant lead time and then only to a relatively small percentage of the population. The use of existing antivirals could be critical in limiting the initial spread of a pandemic, although their use in the control of epidemics caused by nonpandemic viruses has not been evaluated. It is against this background that a review of recent developments in respiratory antivirals has been undertaken. RECENT FINDINGS The late 1990s were a period of unprecedented activity in the development of new and much superior antivirals for the treatment of influenza infections. However, during the past 2 to 3 years and largely for commercial reasons, there has been a decline in interest in their further development by major drug companies. This situation may soon change with the possible advent of new pandemic viruses, and moves are afoot in several countries to consider the stockpiling of antivirals. The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, remain the only options for controlling respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses, although the latter two could not be used against very recent H5N1 strains. There are several other neuraminidase inhibitors in development. Compounds with activity against other respiratory viruses, notably rhinoviruses, are also in development, many based on a newer knowledge of viral protein structure and function (rational drug design). SUMMARY The following is an overview of recent papers on the further development of neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza viruses and on recent development of newer antivirals against RSV and rhinoviruses. Where possible, comparisons are made with existing antivirals. For considerations of space, this review has been structured around stages in the replication cycle of significant respiratory viruses that have been traditionally used as targets for inhibition.","output":"Antiviral chemotherapeutic agents against respiratory viruses: where are we now and what's in the pipeline?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The issue of indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns 64 million students across Europe, but it is still a neglected topic, although it impacts both their health and learning outcomes. Classroommicroclimate is the first key factor determining a healthy or unhealthy school environment, and it is influenced by ventilation, temperature and humidity rate. Classrooms are usually crowded, overheated and poorly ventilated, thus resulting in possible increases of carbon dioxide (CO2), that can cause several problems when its concentrations exceed the value of 0.15 percentage volume of CO2 (1500 ppm) or even at lower levels (1000 ppm). CO2 can also arise from outside the school, being widely produced by the combustion of fossils or road traffic. Anthropogenic activities are responsible for the emission of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAH) too, which represent other possible external contaminants potentially impairing IAQ. Furtherdangerous exposures for students' health are those related to natural emission of gas Radon, which typically accumulates in poorly ventilated classrooms, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, released by building materials, paints, furnishings, detergents), while chemicals substances (i.e.cyanoacrylate, lead, cadmium, nickel) might be contained in school materials. Finally, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) originating from road traffic, domestic heating or industrial activities represent additional possible contaminants impacting schools' air quality. Poor IAQ might result in mild adverse events (i.e. headaches, nausea etc.) or cause respiratory problems. More frequently, IAQ affects students' attention and their school performances, as widely documented by many studies. Standardized tests administered to pupils exposed to poor IAQ (to assess reading and mathematical abilities) systematically result in worse outcomes compared to students staying in healthy classroom environments.

A simple molecular method for rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains and to track their movement. To complement DNA sequencing, we developed a padlock probe and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based method to detect a series of mutations in the C. albicans ERG11 gene using \\"reference\\" azole-resistant isolates with known mutations. The method was then used to estimate the frequency of ERG11 mutations and their type in 25 Australian clinical C. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates. RCA results were compared DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The RCA assay correctly identified all ERG11 mutations in eight \\"reference\\" C. albicans isolates. When applied to 48 test strains, the RCA method showed 100% agreement with DNA sequencing where an ERG11 mutation-specific probe was used. Of 20 different missense mutations detected by sequencing in 24 of 25 (96%) isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility, 16 were detected by RCA. Five missense mutations were detected by both methods in 18 of 23 (78%) fluconazole-susceptible strains. DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in non-susceptible isolates were all due to homozygous nucleotide changes. With the exception of the mutations leading to amino acid substitution E266D, those in fluconazole-susceptible strains were heterozygous. Amino acid substitutions common to both sets of isolates were D116E, E266D, K128T, V437I and V488I. Substitutions unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility were G464 S (n = 4 isolates), G448E (n = 3), G307S (n = 3), K143R (n = 3) and Y123H, S405F and R467K (each n = 1). DNA sequencing revealed a novel substitution, G450V, in one isolate. CONCLUSION: The sensitive RCA assay described here is a simple, robust and rapid (2 h) method for the detection of ERG11 polymorphisms. It showed excellent concordance with ERG11 sequencing and is a potentially valuable tool to track the emergence and spread of azole-resistant C. albicans and to study the epidemiology of ERG11 mutations.

The original manuscript provides a theoretical and empirical foundation of an instructional design approachempathic designwhere designers, during the design process, predict how learners would feel while engaging in the final design solution. Empathic design has significant implications in the shift to digital during the pandemic. That is, when designing the remote learning experience, instructional designers need to project into the remote contexts and predict learners engagement experiences in these contexts. To address the shift to digital remote learning, empathic design needs to be extended with two important considerations, including learners engagement and the context in which engagement occurs. This paper discusses how empathic design can be applied to consider four types of engagement (i.e., behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social engagement) and three contextual features (e.g., physical environment, technological, and social features) in order to best support learner experiences in the shift to digital remote learning during the pandemic.","output":"Projecting learner engagement in remote contexts using empathic design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put health systems under unprecedented pressure, challenging their workforce, especially nurses. OBJECTIVE: The current paper presented a review of the early literature concerning emerging nursing challenges during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search of the published literature between January and May 2020 was carried out in Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar to identify relevant quantitative and qualitative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two original articles were retrieved, the majority of which were survey studies from China. Synthesis of the evidence resulted in four overarching themes including \\"being physically and mentally drained in the face of fear and uncertainty,\\" \\"shortage of personal protective equipment and usability issues,\\" \\"psychosomatic disturbances among nurses,\\" and \\"moderators to mitigate nurses' challenges.\\" CONCLUSIONS: Providing care for demanding COVID-19 patients, nurses experienced a gruelling situation, during which a significant amount of psychological and physical distress was inflicted to them. However, receiving proper support from their organization and society could improve the condition substantially. Further research is required to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses, especially from Western countries.","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and nursing challenges: A review of the early literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The global COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the TROG 2020 face to face Annual Scientific Meeting (ASM). It was instead delivered as a live virtual meeting with 6 days of planning. Here, we report the participants' experience of this live virtual meeting. METHOD: Participants were invited to complete custom-developed, pre- and post-meeting surveys to assess their expectations of and satisfaction with the live virtual format. Speakers and moderators were also invited to complete a custom-developed satisfaction survey. The working parties of TROG (head/neck/skin, genitourinary, breast and lung) were also sampled. RESULTS: In total, 188/273 (69%) registered participants logged in to the live virtual meeting. The online engagement for each of the oral sessions ranged from 53 to 66%. There were 102 and 57 responders to the online pre- and post-meeting surveys, respectively. The majority of pre-meeting responders indicated a significant level of employer support to attend the virtual meeting. Post-meeting satisfaction exceeded pre-meeting expectations ('very much' and 'quite a bit'; 86% vs. 54%; P < 0.0001). The majority indicated they would be 'quite a bit' or 'very much' interested in future live virtual meetings. CONCLUSION: The TROG 2020 ASM was conducted as a live virtual meeting.

Although every vaccine is developed to induce specific protection for a particular pathogen, some vaccine formulations can also promote trained immunity, which is a non-specific memory-like feature developed by the innate immune system. It is thought that trained immunity can protect against a wide variety of pathogens other than those contained in the vaccine formulation. The non-specific memory of the trained immunity-based vaccines (TIbV) seems beneficial for the immunized individual, as it may represent a powerful strategy that contributes to the control of pathogen outbreaks, reducing morbidity and mortality. A wide variety of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV), cause serious illness in children under 5 years old and the elderly. To address this public health problem, we have developed recombinant BCG vaccines that have shown to be safe and immunogenic against hRSV or hMPV. Besides the induction of specific adaptive immunity against the viral antigens, these vaccines could generate trained immunity against other respiratory pathogens. Here, we discuss some of the features of trained immunity induced by BCG and put forward the notion that recombinant BCGs expressing hRSV or hMPV antigens have the capacity to simultaneously induce specific adaptive immunity and non-specific trained immunity. These recombinant BCG vaccines could be considered as TIbV capable of inducing simultaneously the development of specific protection against hRSV or hMPV, as well as non-specific trained-immunity-based protection against other pathogenic viruses.","output":"Induction of Trained Immunity by Recombinant Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed the most severe impact on the global economy and society since World War II. The pandemic has brought into focus how climate change is related with virus transmission and health, and has made the global transition toward low-carbon development more difficult and challenged the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the pandemic has significantly reduced carbon emissions and improved the environmental quality in the short term, it is still an unwanted event in the process of pursuing sustainable development;although objectively the pandemic has weakened countries efforts in terms of policies and actions to address climate change, the restructuring of global value chains in the post-COVID era has also brought new opportunities for a transition toward green and low-carbon development;although the pandemic has warned people of how important resilient governance and international cooperation is to addressing the crisis, the global climate governance process has come to a complete standstill since the outbreak of COVID-19, attenuating the mutual trust among countries and disabling the leadership in climate governance. The pandemic is a preview of the climate crisis, and it is important to learn from it for a better response. China quickly contained the pandemic within the country, actively resumed work and production, and gained a first-mover advantage in economic recovery. China should maintain strategic focus when pursuing ecological development, enhance the resilience of the socio-economic system, seize the opportunity of transitioning toward low-carbon development by turning the crisis into opportunities, and promote high-quality development within the country while fully engaging in global climate governance to seek ecological progress with other countries.

Virus-laden aerosols produced by infected patients can propagate throughout ventilated rooms and put medical personnel entering them at risk. Experimental results found with a schlieren optical method have shown that the air flows generated by a cough and normal breathing were modified by the oxygenation technique used, especially when using High Flow Nasal Canulae, increasing the shedding of potentially infectious airborne particles. This study also uses a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics model based on a Lattice Boltzmann Method to simulate the air flows as well as the movement of numerous airborne particles produced by a patients cough within an ICU room under negative pressure. The effects of different mitigation scenarii on the amount of aerosols potentially containing SARS-CoV-2 that are extracted through the ventilation system are investigated. Numerical results indicate that adequate bed orientation and additional air treatment unit positioning can increase by 40% the number of particles extracted and decrease by 25% the amount of particles deposited on surfaces 45s after shedding. This approach could help lay the grounds for a more comprehensive way to tackle contamination risks in hospitals, as the model can be seen as a proof of concept and be adapted to any room configuration.","output":"Modeling of aerosol transmission of airborne pathogens in ICU rooms of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the value-based price of a COVID-19 vaccine from a societal perspective in Germany. Methods: A decision model was constructed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, intensive care unit (ICU) costs and outcomes, and herd protection threshold. Three strategies were analysed: vaccination (with 95% and 50% efficacy), a mitigation strategy, and no intervention. The base-case time horizon was 5 years. The value of a vaccine included savings from avoiding COVID-19 mitigation measures and health benefits from avoiding COVID-19 related mortality. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19. Results: A vaccine with a 95% efficacy dominates the mitigation strategy strictly. The value-based price (1494 euros) is thus determined by the comparison between vaccination and no intervention. This price is particularly sensitive to the probability of ICU admission and the herd protection threshold. In contrast, the value of a vaccine with 50% efficacy is more ambiguous. Conclusion: This study yields a value-based price for a COVID-19 vaccine with 95% efficacy, which is more than 50 times greater than the purchasing price.","output":"Value-based pricing of a COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In present days, the use of information technology (IT) in education is unquestionable. The mounting advancement of IT has changed the scenario of education. With the emergence of the current COVID-19 situation, it has undoubtedly provided a solution to most of our educational needs when all educational institutions remained closed due to the pandemic. This study aims to identify the nursing students attitude towards the practice of e-learning amidst COVID-19. METHODS: A descriptive web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students with a sample size of 470. A self-administered validated questionnaire along with a standard tool to measure the attitude was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: The mean  SD age of the respondents was 20.91 1.55 years. The majority (76.4%) of the respondents used mobile for their study and 90.4% used Wi-Fi for the internet source. The main advantage of e-learning was stated as the ability to stay at home (72.1%) followed by the reduced cost of accommodation and transport (51.3%) whereas the internet problem (81.7%) was the major disadvantage followed by technical issues (65.5%). Only about 34% of the students found e-learning as effective as traditional face-to-face learning. The mean scores for the domains: perceived usefulness, intention to adapt, distant use of e-learning, ease of learning, technical support, and learning stressors were 3.1, 3.1, 3.8, 2.9, 2.9, and 2.5 respectively. Overall, 58.9% had a favorable attitude regarding e-learning. There was no significant association of overall attitude regarding e-learning with selected socio-demographic variables whereas it was positively associated with all of its six domains. All the domains were positively correlated with each other except for ease of learning with technical support and distant use, and technical support with learning stressor and distant use. Learning stressor versus distant use was negatively correlated with each other. CONCLUSION: Though e-learning was implemented as a substitute during the pandemic, almost half of the nursing students showed a positive attitude regarding e-learning. The majority of the students had internet problems and technological issues. If e-learning can be made user-friendly with reduced technical barriers supplemented with programs that can enhance practical learning abilities, e-learning can be the vital alternative teaching method and learning in the nursing field.","output":"Nursing students attitude on the practice of e-learning: A cross-sectional survey amid COVID-19 in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The data and debates around the negative impact of online work for womens work-life balance during the digital acceleration generated by the COVID-19 crisis have lent greater relevance to the study of gender and the digital economy. This paper sheds light on this complex relationship by systematically studying the research on gender in the digital economy over the last 25 years. The methodology used is a systematic literature review (SLR) of scientific works and policy papers across different social sciences from 1995 to 2020 in the Google Scholars and Scopus databases. The SLR has resulted in the creation of three samples on which a quantitative and qualitative analysis was carried out to evaluate the volume of the research, trends across time, gender approaches and study topics. The general conclusions indicate that gender approaches to the digital economy stem from a wide range of academic disciplines, and also that there is a lack of theoretical consistency about gender analysis. First, the paper provides an overview of the volume of works and an analysis of some trends across time. Second, it identifies the three main gender approaches applied to the digital economy: (1) the feminist theory of technology and ICT approach;(2) the feminist political economy approach;(3) the mainstream economic analysis and womens participation and labour in the digital economy approach. Moreover, it distinguishes eight main gender analysis issues within these three approaches. Finally, the paper concludes by identifying future developments for a feminist political economy framework for the digital economy.","output":"Gender approaches in the study of the digital economy: a systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using interval-valued data and computing, researchers have reported significant quality improvements of the stock market annual variability forecasts recently.

Congress passed the CARES Act in March 2020, a $2 trillion relief package, offering augmented unemployment relief not only to employees but also to the self-employed, including gig workers. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) was passed to provide sick leave in the form of tax credits that also extended to the self-employed. Beyond the governmental responses, Platform companies offered new limited relief to their workers in the form of sick leave, even as they continue to classify them as freelancers. Mass layoffs alongside mass hiring present immense legal challenges even without a health pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis adds the challenges of health and safety, social distancing, risk management, and telecommuting. This essay written for a symposium on Covid-19 and the Law examines employment law and employee classification in relation to the contemporary realities of the labor market during the Coronavirus pandemic. As business models and market structures are constantly changing and shifting, one thing remains the same: how we classify the work relationship carries enormous weight in determining the rights and duties of market actors. This essay presents the ways the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of gig workers and the irrationalities of rigid classification tests that have always been the Achilles heel of the field of employment and labor law. The essay explores pandemic related economic benefits that have been extended to freelancers and considers the ways the pandemic reveals the nature (and future) of the gig economy. Part I explains the federal and state efforts to expand unemployment benefits to freelancers. It describes how the CARES and FFCRA Acts have expanded the emergency unemployment benefits, paid sick leave, and expanded family and medical leave to freelancers, and yet the funding and the operational details of these programs are still contested. Part II describes the continued service of gig workers during the pandemic, especially in the delivery sector, and how classification as freelancers has left many without medical leave rights, health and safety rights, and other protections. Drawing on my recent research, Part III argues that the fight over employee classification is a red herring, as it misses the point about what public protections ought to be provided to all workers in the labor market. I propose that certain employment and labor protections should be extended to non-employees whether they work on the digital platform or offline in more traditional settings. I further argue that our social welfare system should not be so heavily linked to the labor market.","output":"We Are All Gig Workers Now: Online Platforms, Freelancers and The Battles Over Employment Status and Rights During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis excluded domesticated species, gamebirds, fish and species protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) [ ]despite national legislation in some countries, international trade in non-CITES wildlife species is largely unregulated and unmonitored, and that trade C much of it to supply the exotic pets trade C is one of the major factors driving species and biodiversity loss worldwide,5 as well as driving the introduction of invasive species and spreading both animal and human diseases (for example, chytridiomycosis, which is currently decimating the worlds amphibian populations, and, of course, the current Covid-19 pandemic) Importing non-native animals www gov uk/guidance/importing-non-native-animals#import-non-native-animals (accessed 4 October 2020) 4 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species","output":"International wildlife trade is largely unregulated"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The inflammatory mediator and oxidant agent storm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been strongly associated with the failure of vital organs observed in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the death of thousands of infected people around the world.

The work presented here shows that this idea is debatable. Data from Spain, a country where daily internet users are 75.9 percent of the population, prove that the gender gap still exists. The paper explores if this gap can be entirely explained by the socioeconomic differences between men and women. We build a micro panel model and incorporate a set of socioeconomic variables (age, education, income, employment status, digital skills, and resident population) that allow us to isolate the effects of gender on the decision to become a daily Internet user. The results conclude that the Internet gap is a phenomenon with a specific gender component. Other things being equal a woman negatively affects the probability of using the Internet. Applying a similar model to 15 Internet services, we obtain that gender is always significant to explain the likelihood of being a user of each service. However, in some services (7 out of 15), the effect is favorable to women, and for other services (8), the gender effect favors men.

As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant subgroup classified as experiencing an adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic. METHODS: Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multiwave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14 to 29, 2020. Participants (N=3000) were adults living in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. RESULTS: Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping \\"not well\\" with COVID-19-related stress (n=22, 5.5%). Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.","output":"Use of Asynchronous Virtual Mental Health Resources for COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stress Among the General Population in Canada: Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Classification is one of the most important research and applications of machine learning techniques Research in the area of human-machine interaction and machine learning contributed to the success of Chatbots Objective: This research concentrates on some of the most important developments in machine learning classification research and the issues of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Since December 2019, COVID-19 has been causing a massive health crisis all over the world resulted in 5,418,237 confirmed and 344,201 death COVID-19 cases to date (24 05 2020) Clinical experts say that COVID-19 patients to be diagnosed in early-stage to save their lives Methods: This study attempted to detect COVID-19 patients who can recover from the disease, using machine learning techniques, so that suitable treatment can be given to the patients to save their lives Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms are used to evaluate the classification performance Result and Conclusion: In this paper, a Chatbot was developed using the best algorithm evaluated to serve the society suffering from COVID-19 ?

We characterized individuals having a higher partner number during the initial phases of the pandemic. METHODS: In British Columbia, the initial wave of COVID-19 cases was from March 14 to May 19, 2020, followed by gradual lifting of public health restrictions. We conducted an e-mail survey of existing sexual health service clients during the period of July 23 to August 4, 2020. We used bivariate logistic regression to examine the association between the reported number of sexual partners since the start of the pandemic and key variables (level of significance p < 0.01). RESULTS: Of the 1196 clients in our final sample, 42% reported 2+ partners since the start of the pandemic, with higher odds among participants who were men who have sex with men, and single or in open relationships prior to the pandemic. This group was more likely to perceive stigma associated with having sex during the pandemic, and had the highest use of strategies to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection during sexual encounters (mainly focused on reducing/avoiding partners, such as masturbation, limiting sex to a bubble, and not having sex).

This study evaluates the impact of universal face mask use on rates and outcomes of post-injection endophthalmitis (PIE). DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, comparative cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Eyes receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections from October 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, at 12 centers. METHODS: Cases were divided into a \\"no face mask\\" group if no face masks were worn by the physician or patient during intravitreal injections or a \\"universal face mask\\" group if face masks were worn by the physician, ancillary staff, and patient during intravitreal injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of endophthalmitis, microbial spectrum, and visual acuity (VA). RESULTS: Of 505 968 intravitreal injections administered in 110 547 eyes, 85 of 294 514 (0.0289%; 1 in 3464 injections) cases of presumed endophthalmitis occurred in the \\"no face mask\\" group, and 45 of 211 454 (0.0213%; 1 in 4699) cases occurred in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.18; P = 0.097). In the \\"no face mask\\" group, there were 27 cases (0.0092%; 1 in 10 908 injections) of culture-positive endophthalmitis compared with 9 cases (0.004%; 1 in 23 494) in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P = 0.041). Three cases of oral flora-associated endophthalmitis occurred in the \\"no face mask\\" group (0.001%; 1 in 98 171 injections) compared with 1 (0.0005%; 1 in 211 454) in the \\"universal face mask\\" group (P = 0.645). Patients presented a mean (range) 4.9 (1-30) days after the causative injection, and mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) VA at endophthalmitis presentation was 2.04 (~20/2200) for \\"no face mask\\" group compared with 1.65 (~20/900) for the \\"universal face mask\\" group (P = 0.022), although no difference was observed 3 months after treatment (P = 0.764). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multicenter, retrospective study, physician and patient face mask use during intravitreal anti-VEGF injections did not alter the risk of presumed acute-onset bacterial endophthalmitis, but there was a reduced rate of culture-positive endophthalmitis.

Participating organizations received restrictive funding from this network to screen pregnant women and new mothers for depression, make appropriate referrals, and log screening and referral data into a project-wide data system over a one-year pilot program. This paper asked three research questions: (1) What problems emerged by mid-implementation of this program that required course correction? (2) How were advocacy targets developed to influence network and agency responses to these mid-course problems? (3) What specific course corrections were identified and implemented to get implementation back on track? This ethnographic case study employs qualitative methods including participant observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using the analytic method of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present. Three key findings are noted. First, network participants quickly responded to the emerged problem of under-performing screening and referral completion statistics. Second, they shifted advocacy targets away from executive appeals and toward the line staff actually providing screening. Third, participants endorsed two specific course corrections, using opt out, not opt in choice architecture at intake and implementing visual incentives for workers to track progress.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia receiving standard of care + tocilizumab who were alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 6 after treatment initiation were included in this retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of mechanical ventilation or death by day-28 from treatment initiation and -coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Secondary outcome was mortality. Patients with the same inclusion criteria as the derivation cohort from 3 independent hospitals were used as validation cohort. RESULTS: 266 patients treated with tocilizumab were included. By day 28 of hospital follow-up post treatment initiation, 40 (15%) underwent mechanical ventilation or died [26 (10%)]. At multivariable analysis, sex, day-4 PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, platelets and CRP were independently associated with the risk of developing the study outcomes and were used to generate the proposed risk score. The accuracy of the score in AUC was 0.80 and 0.70 in internal validation and test for the composite endpoint and 0.92 and 0.69 for death, respectively.

Those with previous COVID-19 infection may have not been prioritized due to existing humoral immunity. ObjectiveWe aim to study the association between previous COVID-19 infection and antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsA serological analysis to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies was performed on individuals who received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Kuwait. Generalized linear regression models adjusted for individual characteristics and comorbidities were fitted to study the average levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals based who had previous COVID-19 infection compared to those who had not. ResultsA total of 1025 individuals were recruited. The mean levels of IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies were higher in vaccinated subjects with previous COVID-19 infection when compared with those vaccinated without previous COVID-19 infection. Regression analysis showed a steeper slope of decline for IgG in vaccinated individuals without previous COVID-19 infection in comparison with vaccinated individuals with previous COVID-19 infection. ConclusionPrevious COVID-19 infection appears to elicit robust and sustained levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in vaccinated individuals.

Using human adductor pollicis muscle, we studied how contraction-induced reductions in twitch duration, without changes in twitch force, affects summation of twitch pairs into higher force contractions. What is the main finding and its importance? Abbreviating twitch duration with a brief contraction resulted in enhanced summation of fully fused twitch pairs, but impaired summation in partially-fused twitch pairs even after accounting for the differences in relaxation of the first twitch. An inherent mechanism which enhances relaxation without sacrificing force generation in forceful contractions would benefit cyclic muscle activities, such as locomotion. ABSTRACT During electrically-evoked contractions of skeletal muscle, the interplay between twitch duration and the time between electrical stimuli (inter-pulse interval, IPI) determines how effectively twitch forces summate into high force contractions. A brief muscle contraction can impair summation by abbreviating twitch duration, though it is not clear if these impairments occur at all physiologically relevant IPI. This study was designed to test how a brief contraction affects summation of nominally isometric twitch pairs with IPIs lasting 10-5000 ms. Left adductor pollicis muscles of human participants (n = 9) were electrically activated using stimulus pairs applied both before (Pre) and after (Post) a 10 Hz 1.0 s contraction. Force-time records were mathematically separated into Pulse 1 (single twitch) and Pulse 2 (summated twitch) components. The ratio of Pulse 2 peak force to Pulse 1 peak force was used as our measure of summation effectiveness. Consistent with the observed decline of Pulse 1 duration at Post relative to Pre (4.7  0.6%; P < 0.001; duration was defined as the time from stimulation to the time required for active force to decline by 50%), summation effectiveness was higher at Pre than at Post at IPIs of 100-333 ms. Summation effectiveness was not different between Pre and Post at IPIs of 50-83 ms or 500-5000 ms. Intriguingly, summation effectiveness was higher at Post than at Pre at IPIs of 10-25 ms. In summary, a brief contraction has complex effects on the relationship between inter-pulse interval and summation effectiveness. Future experiments are needed to reveal the mechanisms behind this novel observation. This article is protected by copyright.

Vaccination is critical for preventing disease and severe downstream outcomes; however, vaccination rates among older adults are suboptimal. We assessed predictors associated with pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccination among older women. METHODS: We used data from the Women's Health Initiative, a nationwide cohort of women. We ascertained seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status through a questionnaire administered in 2013. We limited analyses to women aged 65 years at questionnaire administration. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors and vaccination and explored stratification by race. RESULTS: Of participants who responded to each question, 84.3% (n = 60 578) reported being vaccinated for influenza and 85.5% (n = 59 015) for pneumonia. The odds of reporting influenza vaccination were significantly lower among non-Hispanic Black participants than among non-Hispanic White participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.49-0.58), women with no health insurance versus private health insurance (OR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.68), and women living in rural versus urban settings (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96). Current smoking, lower education levels, and having comorbid conditions were associated with lower likelihood of being vaccinated for influenza (than not); past pneumonia diagnosis and being currently married were associated with a higher likelihood. We observed similar associations for pneumococcal vaccination coverage.

Orbital fibroblasts contribute to both orbital tissue inflammation and remodeling in GO, and as such are crucial cellular elements in active GO and inactive GO. However, so far it is largely unknown whether GO disease progression is associated with functional reprogramming of the orbital fibroblast effector function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare both the proteome and global DNA methylation patterns between orbital fibroblasts isolated from active GO, inactive GO and healthy controls. METHODS: Orbital fibroblasts from inactive GO (n=5), active GO (n=4) and controls (n=5) were cultured and total protein and DNA was isolated. Labelled and fractionated proteins were analyzed with a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022257. Furthermore, bisulphite-treated DNA was analyzed for methylation pattern with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K beadchip. In addition, RNA was isolated from the orbital fibroblasts for real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR. Network and pathway analyses were performed. RESULTS: Orbital fibroblasts from active GO displayed overexpression of proteins that are typically involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation, hyaluronan synthesis and adipogenesis, while various proteins associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) biology and fibrotic disease, were typically overexpressed in orbital fibroblasts from inactive GO. Moreover, orbital fibroblasts from active GO displayed hypermethylation of genes that linked to inflammation and hypomethylated genes that linked to adipogenesis and autoimmunity. Further analysis revealed networks that contained molecules to which both hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were linked, including NF-B, ERK1/2, Alp, RNA polymerase II, Akt and IFN. In addition, NF-B, Akt and IFN were also identified in networks that were derived from the differentially expressed proteins. Generally, poor correlation between protein expression, DNA methylation and mRNA expression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Both the proteomics and DNA methylation data support that orbital fibroblasts from active GO are involved in inflammation, adipogenesis, and glycosaminoglycan production, while orbital fibroblasts from inactive disease are more skewed towards an active role in extracellular matrix remodeling. This switch in orbital fibroblast effector function may have therapeutic implications and further studies into the underlying mechanism are thus warranted.","output":"Integrative Analysis of Proteomics and DNA Methylation in Orbital Fibroblasts From Graves Ophthalmopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhibition of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is expected to block the spike protein-mediated fusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

A unique aspect of the molecular binding of nafamostat has been recently reported to be the formation of a covalent bond between its acyl substructure and Ser441 in TMPRSS2. In this study, we investigated crucial elements that cause the difference in anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of nafamostat and camostat. In silico analysis showed that Asp435 significantly contributes to the binding of nafamostat and camostat to TMPRSS2, while Glu299 interacts strongly only with nafamostat. The estimated binding affinity for each compound with TMPRSS2 was actually consistent with the higher activity of nafamostat; however, the evaluation of the newly synthesized nafamostat derivatives revealed that the predicted binding affinity did not correlate with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity measured by the cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. It was further shown that the substitution of the ester bond with amide bond in nafamostat resulted in significantly weakened anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results strongly indicate that the ease of covalent bond formation with Ser441 in TMPRSS2 possibly plays a major role in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of nafamostat and its derivatives.","output":"In Silico Analysis and Synthesis of Nafamostat Derivatives and Evaluation of Their Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The most common reported presentations were transverse myelitis (12/32) and MS-like pictures (first diagnosis or a relapse) in another 12/32 cases, followed by ADEM- like (5/32), and NMOSD- like (3/32) presentations. History of a previous immune-mediated disease was reported in 17/32 (53.1%) cases. The mRNA-based vaccines resulted in the greatest number of demyelinating syndromes (17/32), followed by viral vector vaccines (10/32), and inactivated vaccines (5/32). Most MS-like episodes (9/12) were triggered by mRNA-based vaccines, while TM occurred following both viral vector and mRNA-based vaccines. Management included high dose methylprednisolone, PLEX, IVIg, or a combination of those, with a favorable outcome in the majority of case; marked/complete improvement (25/32) or stabilized/ partial recovery in the remaining cases. CONCLUSION: This systematic review identified few cases of CNS demyelination following all types of approved COVID-19 vaccines so far. Clinical presentation was heterogenous, mainly following the first dose, however, half of the reported cases had history of immune-mediated disease. Favorable outcome was observed in most cases. We suggest long-term post-marketing surveillance for these cases, to assess for causality, and ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"A systematic review of cases of CNS demyelination following COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 cases are still rising globally in the middle of the tuberculosis epidemic.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","output":"Refuting the myth of a 'tsunami' of mental ill-health in populations affected by COVID-19: evidence that response to the pandemic is heterogeneous, not homogeneous"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O objetivo deste trabalho  analisar os dados de movimenta??o de bovinos, gerando informa??es teis  vigilancia epidemiolgica do Estado de Mato Grosso.

For the characterization of gait alterations related to pathology, gait timing assessment is of primary importance. With the widespread use of inertial sensors, several algorithms have been proposed for gait timing estimation (i.e. gait events and temporal parameters) out of the water, while an assessment of their performance for walking in water is still missing. The purpose of the present study was to assess the performance in the temporal segmentation for gait in water of 17 algorithms proposed in the literature. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors (trunk, shanks and feet) walked on dry land and in water. Seventeen different algorithms were implemented and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, and 3) computational approach. Gait events identified from synchronized video recordings were assumed as reference. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of sensitivity, positive predictive value, accuracy, and repeatability. RESULTS: For walking in water, all Trunk-based algorithms provided a sensitivity lower than 81% and a positive predictive value lower than 94%, as well as acceleration-based algorithms, independently from sensor location, with the exception of two Shank-based ones. Drop in algorithm sensitivity and positive predictive value was associated to significant differences in the stride pattern of the specific analysed variables during walking in water as compared to walking on dry land, as shown by the intraclass correlation coefficient. When using Shank- or Foot-based algorithms, gait events resulted delayed, but the delay was compensated in the estimate of Stride and Step time; a general underestimation of Stance- and overestimation of Swing-time was observed, with minor exceptions. CONCLUSION: Sensor position, target variable and computational approach determined different error distributions for different gait events and temporal parameters for walking in water. This work supports an evidence-based selection of the most appropriate algorithm for gait timing estimation for walking in water as related to the specific application, and provides relevant information for the design of new algorithms for the specific motor task.","output":"Timing estimation for gait in water from inertial sensor measurements: Analysis of the performance of 17 algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several recent prospective randomized controlled trials of endovascular stroke therapy using latest generation thrombectomy devices, so called stent-retrievers, have shown significantly improved clinical outcome compared to the standard treatment with intra-venous thrombolysis using r-tPA alone.

New understanding has emerged about the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The understanding of innate immune responses generated in hosts early in SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for treatment efforts. Antiviral cytokines are released by innate immune cells in response to viral infections that play a pivotal role in limiting viral replication, pathology and generating optimal adaptive immune responses alongside the long-term memory responses against reinfections. One aspect of innate immune response generated against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and which has received much attention has been high proinflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Another vital discovery has been that the antiviral cytokine type I Interferon (IFN) family IFN- mediates upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein in airway epithelial cells. ACE2 is a receptor that SARS-CoV-2 binds to infect host cells.

Data sources: Four electronic databases: MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Study selection: All articles were original research and published in English. Studies examined adults with remote exposure to mTBI and/or RHIs from ten or more years ago in addition to any associated neuroimaging findings. Data extraction: Parameters mainly included participants' population, age, years since head injury, race, sex, education level, and any neuroimaging findings. Scores for the level of evidence and risk of bias were calculated independently by two authors. Results: 5,521 studies were reviewed, of which 34 met inclusion criteria and were included in this study. The majority of adults in these studies showed positive neuroimaging findings one or more decades following mTBI/RHI exposure. This was consistent across study populations (i.e., veterans, athletes, and the general population). There was evidence for altered protein deposition patterns, micro- and macro-structural, functional, neurochemical, and blood flow-related differences in the brain for those with remote mTBI/RHI exposure. Conclusion: Findings from these studies suggest that past mTBI/RHI exposure may be associated with neuroimaging findings. However, given the methodological constraints related to relatively small sample sizes and the heterogeneity in injury types/exposure and imaging techniques used, conclusions drawn from this review are limited.

Prior work using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in patients under general anesthesia has indicated that ablation results in activity in pain-related cortical regions, presumably due to inadequate blockade of afferent nociceptors originating within the cardiac system. Having an objective brain-based measure for nociception and analgesia may in the future allow for enhanced analgesic control during surgical procedures. Hence, the primary aim of this study is to demonstrate that the administration of remifentanil, an opioid widely used during surgery, can attenuate the fNIRS cortical responses to cardiac ablation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated the effects of continuous remifentanil on cortical hemodynamics during cardiac ablation under anesthesia. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo (PL)-controlled trial, we examined 32 pediatric patients (mean age of 15.8 years,16 females) undergoing catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmias at the Cardiology Department of Boston Childrens Hospital from October 2016 to March 2020; 9 received 0.9% NaCl, 12 received low-dose (LD) remifentanil (0.25 mcg/kg/min), and 11 received high-dose (HD) remifentanil (0.5 mcg/kg/min). The hemodynamic changes of primary somatosensory and prefrontal cortices were recorded during surgery using a continuous wave fNIRS system. The primary outcome measures were the changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration (Nadir(HbO), i.e., lowest oxyhemoglobin concentration and Peak(HbO), i.e., peak change and area under the curve) of medial frontopolar cortex (mFPC), lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to ablation in PL versus remifentanil groups. Secondary measures included the fNIRS response to an auditory control condition. The data analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Remifentanil group (dosage subgroups combined) was compared with PL, and a post hoc analysis was performed to identify dose effects. There were no adverse events. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and number of ablations. Results comparing remifentanil versus PL show that PL group exhibit greater Nadir(HbO) in inferior mFPC (mean difference (MD) = 1.229, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.334, 2.124, p < 0.001) and superior mFPC (MD = 1.206, 95% CI = 0.303, 2.109, p = 0.001) and greater Peak(HbO) in inferior mFPC (MD = ?1.138, 95% CI = ?2.062, ?0.214, p = 0.002) and superior mFPC (MD = ?0.999, 95% CI = ?1.961, ?0.036, p = 0.008) in response to ablation. S1 activation from ablation was greatest in PL, then LD, and HD groups, but failed to reach significance, whereas lPFC activation to ablation was similar in all groups. Ablation versus auditory stimuli resulted in higher Peak(HbO) in inferior mFPC (MD = 0.053, 95% CI = 0.004, 0.101, p = 0.004) and superior mFPC (MD = 0.052, 95% CI = 0.013, 0.091, p < 0.001) and higher Nadir(HbO) in posterior superior S1 (Pos. SS1; MD = ?0.342, 95% CI = ?0.680, ?0.004, p = 0.007) during ablation of all patients. Remifentanil group had smaller Nadir(HbO) in inferior mFPC (MD = 0.098, 95% CI = 0.009, 0.130, p = 0.003) and superior mFPC (MD = 0.096, 95% CI = 0.008, 0.116, p = 0.003) and smaller Peak(HbO) in superior mFPC (MD = ?0.092, 95% CI = ?0.680, ?0.004, p = 0.007) during both the stimuli. Study limitations were small sample size, motion from surgery, indirect measure of nociception, and shallow penetration depth of fNIRS only allowing access to superficial cortical layers. CONCLUSIONS: We observed cortical activity related to nociception during cardiac ablation under general anesthesia with remifentanil. It highlights the potential of fNIRS to provide an objective pain measure in unconscious patients, where cortical-based measures may be more accurate than current evaluation methods. Future research may expand on this application to produce a real-time indication of pain that will aid clinicians in providing immediate and adequate pain treatment.

All patients had a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19) based on a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA and/or a typical pattern of viral pneumonia on multispiral computed tomography. The severity of lung damage was limited to stage I-II, the level of CRP should not exceed 60 mg / dL and SO2 in the air within 92-98%.

Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available against SARS-CoV-2 but numerous candidate vaccines are in development and repurposed drugs are being tested in the clinic. There is a vital need for authentic COVID-19 animal models to further our understanding of pathogenesis and viral spread in addition to pre-clinical evaluation of candidate interventions. Here we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most suitable infectious dose to use in the ferret model. We show that a high (5106 pfu) and medium (5104 pfu) dose of SARS-CoV-2 induces consistent upper respiratory tract (URT) viral RNA shedding in both groups of six challenged animals, whilst a low dose (5102 pfu) resulted in only one of six displaying signs of URT viral RNA replication. The URT shedding lasted up to 21 days in the high dose animals with intermittent positive signal from day 14. Sequential culls revealed distinct pathological signs of mild multifocal bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung, observed on day 3 in high and medium dosed animals, with presence of mild broncho-interstitial pneumonia on day 7 onwards. No obvious elevated temperature or signs of coughing or dyspnoea were observed although animals did present with a consistent post-viral fatigue lasting from day 9-14 in the medium and high dose groups. After virus shedding ceased, re-challenged ferrets were shown to be fully protected from acute lung pathology. The endpoints of URT viral RNA replication in addition to distinct lung pathology and post viral fatigue were observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease (as displayed by 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2).

A total of 119 adult patients required ECMO treatment following ARDS secondary to H1N1 (49) and SARS-CoV-2 (70) in the referral ECMO Center based in Zagreb between October 2009 and October 2021. Our study revealed a significantly higher mortality in COVID-19 patients compared to H1N1 influenza when the onset of ARDS was severe enough to require ECMO support. Based on these results and current knowledge, we argue that ECMO treatment for ARDS in COVID-19 patients is more challenging compared to H1N1 influenza patients. Therefore, referral to the most experienced ECMO centers should be considered. Additionally, patient selection and timing for ECMO treatment play a key role in relation to outcome. Mortality rate in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO treatment may be used as a reference frame for ECMO centers to ensure best possible care and outcome.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the treatment of ARDS in Covid-19 and influenza patients: Does etiology matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging mobility technologies are changing the transportation system landscape. This is especially evident at airports, such as the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Without careful analysis, these changes could lead to inefficient and costly airport operations. This paper presents a modeling framework that integrates travel mode encoding, demand projection, and microsimulation to enable airports to develop, simulate, and evaluate curbside traffic managements policies and measure their impact. The framework is utilized to analyze several traffic scenarios and policies for DFW: a baseline scenario which represents DFW traffic pattern as observed in 2018 and projected to 2045, a transit network company (TNC) electrification policy, a TNC queuing policy, a policy that increased transit ridership, a bus-only policy which considers the use of only buses inside DFW, an autonomous vehicle (AV) policy which investigates the impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption on airport operations, and an example COVID-19 scenario which models the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. The simulations results demonstrate that: increasing the DFW transit ridership postpones the need for airport curbside expansion the most;encouraging shared-mobility with the bus-only policy produces the most savings in curbside congestion delays;automation and electrification for all passenger vehicle trips to/from DFW generates the most saving in fuel consumption and emissions;and uncontrolled AV adoption incurs the highest increase in fuel consumption, delay, and emissions and could require immediate airport capacity extension. Without policy intervention or investment in additional infrastructure capacity, these results predict the current operations would face significant congestion on high demand days starting as early as 2028.

OBJECTIVE: Assess the prevalence and factors associated with PRAEs among pediatric surgical patients in University Hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODOLOGY: After ethical approval obtained prospective observational study was conducted among 210 pediatric surgical patients. Perioperative respiratory adverse events were defined as the occurrence of any episode of single/combination of coughing, breath holding, hypoxemia, laryngospasm and bronchospasm. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed and variables with p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of PRAEs was 26.2% (CI: 20.5C30.9%). A total of 129 episodes of PRAEs were occurred and of them, 89 (69.0%) were occurred in the postoperative period. Desaturation was the predominant adverse event which was observed 61 (47.3%) times. Age <1 year (AOR: 3.6, CI: 1.3C10.0), ASA  3 (AOR: 5.2, CI: 1.9C22.9), upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (AOR: 7.6, CI: 1.9C30.2), secretions in the upper airway (AOR: 4.8, CI: 1.4C15.9) and airway related surgery (AOR: 6.0, CI: 1.5C24.1) were significantly associated with PRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of PRAEs was high among pediatric surgical patients; the postoperative period was the most critical time for the occurrence of PRAEs and desaturation was the commonest PRAE.

Our hypothesis is that if there is a past or an ongoing oil extraction rate peak then Hubberts model is verified. If there are multiple episodes of productivity peaks, then it is rejected. We find that the Peak Theory is not confirmed and that shale production mainly responds to demand signals. Therefore, the oil production curve is flattened prolonging oil dependency and energy transition. Since the US production is free of geological constraints, then maximum productivity may not ever be reached due to lower demand levels.

Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is essential for the management of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We aimed to assess the impact of compliance with a respiratory decision support system on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS who required IMV. Methods In this retrospective, single-center, case series, 46 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS who required IMV at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from January 8, 2020, to March 24, 2020, with the final follow-up date of April 20, 2020, were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and management information were collected and analyzed. Compliance with the respiratory support decision system was documented, and its relationship with 28-day mortality was evaluated. Results The median age of the 46 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS requiring IMV was 68.5 years, and 31 were men. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 104 mmHg. The median total length of IMV was 12.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 6.0C27.3) days, and the median respiratory support decision score was 11.0 (IQR, 7.8C16.0). To 28 days after ICU admission, 18 (39.1%) patients died. Survivors had a significantly higher respiratory support decision score than non-survivors (15.0 [10.3C17.0] vs. 8.5 (6.0C10.3), P = 0.001). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the discrimination of respiratory support decision score to 28-day mortality, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.796 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.657C0.934, P = 0.001) and the cut-off was 11.5 (sensitivity = 0.679, specificity = 0.889). Patients with a higher score (>11.5) were more likely to survive at 28 days after ICU admission (log-rank test, P < 0.001).

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with microemboli or microvascular endothelial injuries. Here, we report that serum syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a component of the endothelial glycocalyx, may be a biomarker of severity classification for COVID-19 related to endothelial injury. Methods: and analysis : We analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients for one year from February 2020 at Yokohama City University Hospital and Yokohama City University Medical Center Hospital. We selected COVID-19 patients who required admission care, including intensive care, and analyzed the classification of severe and critical COVID-19 retrospectively, using various clinical data and laboratory data with serum SDC-1 by ELISA. Results: We analyzed clinical and laboratory data with SDC-1 in five severe COVID-19 and ten critical COVID-19 patients. In the two groups, their backgrounds were almost the same. In laboratory data, the LDH, CHE, and CRP levels showed significant differences in each group ( P =0.032, P <0.0001, and P = 0.007, respectively) with no significant differences in coagulation-related factors (platelet, PT-INR, D-dimer, ISTH score;P =0.200, 0.277, 0.655, and 0.36, respectively).

In 2014, the non-governmental organization (NGO) Un Kilo de Ayuda started to implement the Neurological and Psycho-affective Early Childhood Development Program in eighty marginalized communities of Oaxaca. In this article, we present the impact evaluation design to estimate the effect of this program on ECD. METHODS: We will use a cluster randomized stepped-wedge design with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Communities will be randomly assigned to each study group: four groups of twenty communities each. We expect that children from intervened communities will show better ECD outcomes.

METHODS: The most characteristic findings and the pending controversies were derived from a literature review and previous personal experiences. A single paragraph focused on some atypical examples of the disease presenting under confounding pretences. RESULTS: Headache, visual field alterations and impaired pituitary secretion are the most frequent clinical findings of the disease. Pituitary biopsy, still considered the gold diagnostic standard, does not always receive consent from the patients. The role of magnetic resonance imaging is limited, as this disease may generate images similar to those of other diseases. The role of antipituitary and antihypothalamus antibodies is still discussed owing to methodological difficulties and also because the findings on the true pituitary antigen(s) are still debated. However, the low sensitivity and specificity of immunofluorescence, one of the more widely employed methods to detect these antibodies, may be improved, considering a predetermined cut-off titre and a particular kind of immunostaining. CONCLUSION: Autoimmune hypophysitis is a multifaceted disease, which may certainly be diagnosed by pituitary biopsy. However, the possible different clinical, laboratory and imaging features must be considered by the physician to avoid a misdiagnosis when examining a possibly affected patient. Therapeutic choice has to be made taking into account the clinical conditions and the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary involvement, but also considering that spontaneous remissions can occur.","output":"Revisitation of autoimmune hypophysitis: knowledge and uncertainties on pathophysiological and clinical aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Antiviral and immunomodulatory agents have been proposed as potential treatments. Azithromycin exhibits both properties and therefore may play a role. AREAS COVERED This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety of azithromycin in viral infections, with emphasis on COVID-19. A literature search of PUBMED was conducted on May 30th and updated on July 28th. EXPERT OPINION Azithromycin presents in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and could act in different points of the viral cycle. Its immunomodulatory properties include the ability to downregulate cytokine production, maintain epithelial cell integrity or prevent lung fibrosis. In other settings, azithromycin use was associated with a reduction in mortality and ventilation-days. These properties could be beneficial throughout the course of COVID-19. However, the evidence of its use is still scarce and of low quality. Azithromycin has been assessed in retrospective observational studies mainly in combination with hydroxychloroquine, which has shown to provide no benefit. Azithromycin exhibits a well-known safety profile. The stage of the disease where it offers the greatest benefits and the effect of its combination with other drugs are important questions that need to be addressed in the upcoming clinical trials.","output":"Azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundOptimising outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 patients requires early interdisciplinary rehabilitation. As admission numbers soared through the pandemic, the redeployed workforce needed rapid, effective training to deliver these rehabilitation interventions.MethodsThe COVID-19 ICU Remote-Learning Rehab Course (CIRLC-rehab) is a one-day interdisciplinary course developed after the success of CIRLC-acute. The aim of CIRLC-rehab was to rapidly train healthcare professionals to deliver physical, nutritional and psychological rehabilitation strategies in the ICU/acute setting. The course used blended learning with interactive tutorials delivered by shielding critical care professionals. CIRLC-rehab was evaluated through a mixed-methods approach, including questionnaires, and follow-up semi-structured interviews to evaluate perceived impact on clinical practice. Quantitative data are reported as n (%) and means (SD). Inductive descriptive thematic analysis with methodological triangulation was used to analyse the qualitative data from the questionnaires and interviews.Results805 candidates completed CIRLC-rehab. 627 (78.8%) completed the post-course questionnaire. 95% (n = 596) found CIRLC-rehab extremely or very useful and 96.0% (n = 602) said they were very likely to recommend the course to colleagues. Overall confidence rose from 2.78/5 to 4.14/5. The course promoted holistic and humanised care, facilitated informal networks, promoted interdisciplinary working and equipped the candidates with practical rehabilitation strategies that they implemented into clinical practice.ConclusionThis pragmatic solution to educating redeployed staff during a pandemic increased candidates? confidence in the rehabilitation of critically ill patients. There was also evidence of modifications to clinical care utilising learning from the course that subjectively facilitated holistic and humanised rehabilitation, combined with the importance of recognising the humanity, of those working in ICU settings themselves.

We propose a novel fake news detection framework that can address these challenges. Our proposed framework exploits the information from the news articles and the social contexts to detect fake news. The proposed model is based on a Transformer architecture, which has two parts: the encoder part to learn useful representations from the fake news data and the decoder part that predicts the future behaviour based on past observations. We also incorporate many features from the news content and social contexts into our model to help us classify the news better. In addition, we propose an effective labelling technique to address the label shortage problem.

This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the clinical and virologic outcomes associated with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use in COVID-19 patients during a pandemic wave dominated by the Omicron BA.2 variant. MethodsWe analyzed data from a territory-wide retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 26th February 2022 to 26th April 2022 in Hong Kong. Oral antiviral users were matched with controls using propensity-score matching in a ratio of 1:4. Study outcomes were a composite outcome of disease progression (all-cause mortality, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV], or intensive care unit admission) and their individual outcomes, and lower viral load of cycle threshold (Ct) value []30 cycles. Hazard ratios (HR) of event outcomes were estimated using Cox regression models. ResultsAmong 40,776 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection over a mean follow-up of 41.3 days with 925,713 person-days, 2,359 and 1,000 patients not initially requiring oxygen therapy were initiated with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, respectively. The crude incidence rates of all-cause mortality and IMV were 22.24 and 1.06 events per 10,000 person-days among molnupiravir users, 11.04 and 1.75 events per 10,000 person-days among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users. Oral antiviral use was associated with a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of disease progression (molnupiravir: HR=0.53, 95%CI=0.46-0.62, p<0.001; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=0.33, 95%CI=0.24-0.46, p<0.001) than non-use, which was consistently observed for all-cause mortality (molnupiravir: HR=0.55, 95%CI=0.47-0.63, p<0.001; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=0.32, 95%CI=0.23-0.45, p<0.001). Molnupiravir users had lower risks of IMV (HR=0.31, 95%CI=0.16-0.61, p<0.001). Time to achieving lower viral load was significantly shorter among oral antiviral users than matched controls (molnupiravir: HR=1.21, 95%CI=1.07-1.37, p=0.002; nirmatrelvir/ritonavir: HR=1.25, 95%CI=1.04-1.50, p=0.015). Amongst survivors, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had shorter length of hospital stay (-0.70 days, 95%CI=-1.37 to -0.04, p=0.039) than matched controls. Head-to-head comparison of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported higher risk of mortality (HR=1.53 95%CI=1.01-2.31, p=0.047) and longer length of hospital stay (0.83 days, 95%CI=0.07-1.58, p=0.032) for molnupiravir users. ConclusionsAgainst Omicron BA.2, initiation of novel oral antiviral treatment in hospitalized patients not requiring any oxygen therapy was associated with lower risks of disease progression and all-cause mortality, in addition to achieving low viral load faster. FundingHealth and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe medical and research community are actively exploring the use of oral antivirals in COVID-19 patients to lower their risks of hospitalization and death, and to reduce the burden on healthcare systems. We searched Scopus and PubMed for studies until 13 May 2022 using the search terms \\"SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19\\" AND \\"molnupiravir OR Lagevrio OR EIDD-2801\\" OR \\"nirmatrelvir OR Paxlovid OR PF-07321332\\". Major studies examining the safety and efficacy of molnupiravir include MOVe-IN and MOVe-OUT trials conducted in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively. Clinical evidence for the use of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir came from the EPIC-HR trial conducted among non-hospitalized adults with COVID-19. While no clinical benefits have been observed with molnupiravir use in the inpatient setting among patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, early initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset in non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and risk factors for progression to severe disease has been associated with relative risk reduction of hospitalization or death by 30% and 88%, respectively. Notably, these clinical trials were conducted prior to the prevalence of Omicron variant, and the efficacy of oral antivirals against this current variant of concern can only be inferred from experimental evidence to date. Real-world evidence of oral antiviral use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection of Omicron variant is lacking. Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study exploring the clinical use of oral antivirals during a pandemic wave dominated by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. We conducted a territory-wide, retrospective cohort study to examine the effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients who did not require supplemental oxygen on admission in Hong Kong. Early initiation of oral antivirals within 2 days of admission was associated with significantly lower risks of disease progression and all-cause mortality, in addition to achieving low viral load faster than their respective matched controls. Molnupiravir use was also associated with a significantly lower risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation than non-use. Furthermore, our head-to-head comparison suggested a relatively larger reduction in mortality risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir than molnupiravir use. Implications of all the available evidenceCurrent guidelines are now prioritizing the distribution of oral antivirals to those who do not require supplemental oxygen, but who are at the highest risk of disease progression. Our study cohort reflected such prescription pattern in real-world clinical practice. The antiviral effect and mortality benefit observed in this patient cohort support the use of oral antivirals in COVID-19 patients who do not require supplemental oxygen on admission during a pandemic wave of Omicron variant. Our findings also support the prioritization of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir over molnupiravir use in COVID-19 patients whenever accessible and clinically appropriate, in view of the formers substantial mortality benefit. Ongoing research will inform the safety and effectiveness of oral antivirals in specific patient populations (by vaccination status and viral variants), drug combinations, and different healthcare settings.","output":"Real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir among COVID-19 inpatients during Hong Kong's Omicron BA.2 wave: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) used to be one of the most common genetic causes of infant mortality.

Immature intracellular virus particles are then transported through the secretory pathway and converted to their mature form by cleavage of the prM protein by the cellular protease furin. Earlier studies showed that when the prM and E proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus are expressed together in mammalian cells, they assemble into membrane-containing, icosahedrally symmetrical recombinant subviral particles (RSPs), which are smaller than whole virions but retain functional properties and undergo cleavage maturation, yielding a mature form in which the E proteins are arranged in a regular T = 1 icosahedral lattice. In this study, we generated immature subviral particles by mutation of the furin recognition site in prM. The mutation resulted in the secretion of two distinct size classes of particles that could be separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy showed that the smaller particles were approximately the same size as the previously described mature RSPs, whereas the larger particles were approximately the same size as the virus. Particles of the larger size class were also detected with a wild-type construct that allowed prM cleavage, although in this case the smaller size class was far more prevalent. Subtle differences in endoglycosidase sensitivity patterns suggested that, in contrast to the small particles, the E glycoproteins in the large subviral particles and whole virions might be in nonequivalent structural environments during intracellular transport, with a portion of them inaccessible to cellular glycan processing enzymes. These proteins thus appear to have the intrinsic ability to form alternative assembly products that could provide important clues about the role of lateral envelope protein interactions in flavivirus assembly.","output":"Two distinct size classes of immature and mature subviral particles from tick-borne encephalitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known on the association between clinical factors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) more than 15 days after diagnosis.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of IOP on the aerosol density generated during the use of an NCT and provide references and suggestions for daily protection of ophthalmic medical staff during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This cross-sectional clinical trial included 214 eyes of 140 patients from a hospital in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province. All subjects' IOPs were measured by an NCT (39 eyes with low IOP, 90 eyes with normal IOP, 37 eyes with moderately high IOP, and 48 eyes with very high IOP) between March 7 and June 17, 2020. The density of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 generated during the process of IOP measurement with an NCT was analyzed. IOP values were recorded simultaneously. The aerosols generated during different IOP measurements were plotted in scatter plots. RESULTS: PM2.5 was generated more at the air jet port of the tonometer during the process of IOP measurement (H=2.731, P=0.019). Larger quantities of PM2.5 and PM10 were generated when the IOP was higher, and these differences were statistically significant (PM2.5: H=119.476, P<0.001; PM10: H=160.801, P<0.001). Linear correlation analysis with one variable demonstrated that IOP had significantly positive correlations with PM2.5 (r=0.756, P<0.001) and PM10 (r=0.864, P<0.001).

Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the universal increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.","output":"A scaling approach to estimate the age-dependent COVID-19 infection fatality ratio from incomplete data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than a decade into the 21(st) century, the ability to effectively monitor community health status, as well as forecast, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks and other events of public health significance, remains a major challenge.

Inaccessible by widespread commercial techniques, the mass of single nanoparticles and viruses (>10MDa) can be readily measured by nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)-based mass spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS resonator for capture and detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical solution is hindered by their miniscule surface area, which results in poor limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another hindrance is the necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in part to focus analytes toward the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS. Here, we overcome both limitations by integrating an ion lens onto the NEMS chip. The ion lens is composed of a polymer layer, which charges up by receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to focus the analytes toward an open window aligned with the active area of the NEMS electrostatically. With this integrated system, we have detected the mass of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under ambient conditions and with two orders-of-magnitude improvement in capture efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. We then applied this technology to obtain the mass spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and BoHV-1 virions.

METHODS This study tests the hypothesis that the use of the new generation 3D LVS can significantly improve technical ability on complex laparoscopic tasks in an experimental model. Twenty-four participants (8 experienced, 8 minimally experienced, and 8 inexperienced) were evaluated for 10 different tasks in terms of total execution time and error number. The 4-point lickert scale was used for subjective assessment of the two imaging modalities. RESULTS All tasks were completed by all participants. Statistically significant difference was determined between 3D and 2D systems in the tasks of bead transfer and drop, suturing, and pick-and-place in the inexperienced group; in the task of passing through two circles with the needle in the minimally experienced group; and in the tasks of bead transfer and drop, suturing and passing through two circles with the needle in the experienced group. Three-dimensional imaging was preferred over 2D in 6 of the 10 subjective criteria questions on 4-point lickert scale. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the tasks were completed in a shorter time using 3D LVS compared to 2D LVS. The subjective Likert-scale ratings from each group also demonstrated a clear preference for 3D LVS.

Therapies that address COVID hospitalizations mitigate the need for government-imposed economic restrictions to reduce disease spread and hence the risk that hospitals become overwhelmed. We investigated the potential value of such therapies by estimating the cost of government restrictions imposed during late 2020, costs that COVID therapies might make less necessary. Methods: : We combined high frequency consumer spending and initial unemployment claims data (outcomes), information about when state governments restricted business activities (explanatory variable of interest), and case incidence and mortality data (proxies for the potential confounding effect of pandemic severity on voluntary economic activity reductions). We developed linear mixed models that account for nesting within US state and correlation across observations close in time. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of: (1) limiting attention to the 10 U.S. states that mostly closed at some point during late 2020;(2) excluding subsets of potential confounding variables;(3) altering our outcome variable definition (i.e., for designating a state as mostly closed);and (4) considering alternative model correlation structures. Results: : Government-imposed restrictions reduced total consumer spending by 2% and spending on restaurants and accommodations by 5%.

This study sought to assess the prevalence of impaired self-perceived mental health and identify associated factors among French post-secondary students during the lockdown. Methods: . A cross-sectional study was conducted among French students living in the Grand Est area in France from May 7 to 17, 2020 during the first lockdown. An online survey was used to collect sociodemographic data, learning and teaching conditions, living conditions, and exposure to COVID-19, and self-perceived mental health was assessed with mental composite score (MCS) of the SF-12. Results: . Overall, 4,018 were analyzed. Most participants were female (70.7%), and the mean age was 21.7 years (SD 4.0). The mean MCS score was 44.5 (SD 17.3). Impaired mental health, defined by a MCS<1rst Quartile, was mainly associated with female sex;decreased time for learning;not having access to the outside with a garden, a terrace or a balcony;difficulties with the living situation and having someone in the home affected by the SARS-COV2 requiring hospitalization or not. Conclusion: This study showed that living conditions during lockdown had a clear impact on the mental health of French post-secondary students. There is a need to improve prevention and to access distance education as well as an urgent need for measures to develop healthy coping strategies for students. This is a major challenge to prevent these disorders from developing into true psychiatric illnesses.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 Outbreak and Lockdown on Mental Health Among Post-Secondary Students in the Grand Est Region of France: Results of the PIMS-Cov19 Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Healthcare personnel (HCP) at the front line of care are exposed to occupational hazards that place them at risk for infection, which then endanger patient safety and compromise the capability of the healthcare workforce. As of March 8, 2021 more than 420,170 HCP in US had been infected with SARS CoV-2 with 1,388 deaths. In two Taiwan hospitals COVID-19 outbreaks involved HCP and resulted in shutdown of service. This report describes our prospective health surveillance of the HCP and COVID-19 containment measures in a teaching hospital in Taiwan during Jan. 1 through June 30, 2020. Methods We prospectively monitored incidents, defined as an HCP with the predefined symptoms, reported by HCP through the web-based system. HCP were managed based on an algorithm that included SARS CoV-2 RNA PCR testing. Infection prevention and control policy/practice were reviewed. Results This hospital took care of 17 confirmed COVID-19 cases during the study period and the first Case was admitted on January 23, 2020. Among the 14,210 HCP, there were 367 incident events. Of 283 HCP tested for SARS CoV-2, 179 had predefined symptoms. These included 10 HCP who met the national case definition for COVID-19 infection and 169 based on Extended COVID-19 Community Screening program.

Previously, LINC02605 was identified as a candidate regulator in innate immune response by lncRNA microarray assays. In this study, we systematically analyzed the functions and the acting mechanisms of LINC02605 in antiviral innate immune response. LINC02605 was up-regulated by RNA virus, DNA virus, and type I IFNs in NF-B and Jak-stat dependent manner. Overexpression of LINC02605 promotes RNA virus-induced type I interferon production and inhibited viral replication. Consistently, knockdown of LINC02605 resulted in reduced antiviral immune response and increased viral replication. Mechanistically, LINC02605 released the inhibition of hsa-miR-107 on the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). By microRNA mimics and inhibitors, hsa-miR-107 was demonstrated to not only inhibit PTENs expression but also negatively regulate the antiviral immune response. Knockdown of LINC02605 led to the reduction of PTEN expression both in mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of LINC02605 had an opposite impact. Moreover, LINC02605 attenuated the serine 97 phosphorylation level of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by promoting PTEN expression. Nucleoplasmic fragmentation assay showed that knocking down LINC02605 inhibited the nuclear translocation of IRF3, rendering the host cells more susceptible to viral invasion, while overexpression showed opposite effects. Therefore, LINC02605 is an induced lncRNA by viral infection and plays a positive feedback in antiviral immune response through modulating the nuclear translocation of IRF3.","output":"Interferon-Inducible LINC02605 Promotes Antiviral Innate Responses by Strengthening IRF3 Nuclear Translocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a radical change in safety measures in outpatient clinics.

However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining, and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats, and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the  My Health too CBT program C a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic -- on immediate perceived stress, and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). Methods: : Powered for non-inferiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels >16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores.

The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of hand-sewn end-to-end versus end-to-side cervical esophagogastric anastomoses. METHODS A series of 390 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction was analyzed. RESULTS The end-to-end technique was performed in 112 (29 %) patients and the end-to-side in 278 (71 %) patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 20 (18 %) patients with an end-to-end anastomosis versus 58 (21 %) patients with an end-to-side anastomosis (p = 0.50). A higher incidence in anastomotic strictures was seen in end-to-end anastomoses (48 (43 %)) compared with end-to-side anastomoses (89 (32 %); p = 0.04). Moreover, a median of 11 (7-17) dilations was necessary in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group compared with four (2-8) dilations in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group (p < 0.036). After multivariate analysis, the difference in anastomotic leakage rates remained nonsignificant (p = 0.74), whereas anastomotic stricture rate and number of dilations were higher in the end-to-end group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively).

Postoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records and the time line of clinical course were summarized. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS: In the 11 confirmed cases (3 female, 8 male), median days from symptom onset to case detection was 8.

Many initial studies have focused on the identification of the genetic material of coronavirus and have a poor detection rate for long-term surgery. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 in patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays.

DESIGN AND SETTING A qualitative interview study with GPs working in one English county. METHOD Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 13 GPs. Interview transcripts were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS Three themes were constructed from the data: something we can do, getting the timing right, and delegating care while retaining responsibility. Anticipatory medications were a tangible intervention GPs felt they could offer patients approaching death (something we can do). The prescribing of anticipatory medications was recognised as a harbinger of death for patients and their families. Nevertheless, GPs preferred to discuss and prescribe anticipatory medications weeks before death was expected whenever possible (getting the timing right). After prescribing medications, GPs relied on nurses to assess when to administer drugs and keep them updated about their use (delegating care while retaining responsibility).

Then, the quantitative part continued with the fuzzy Delphi technique in which two factors, decision-making time and agility, were deleted in the first round, and the second round was conducted for the rest of the factors. In that step, 24 factors were assessed based on the opinions of 19 experts. In the second round, none of the factors were removed, and thus the Delphi analysis was concluded. Next, data analysis was carried out by building the structural self-interaction matrix to present the model. According to the results, adoptability is a first-level or dependent variable. Regarding the results of interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the variable of critical success factors is a second-level variable. Enablers, competencies and SME characteristics are the third-level and most effective variables of the model. Accordingly, the initial model of Cloud BI for SMEs is presented as follows: The results of ISM revealed the impact of SME characteristics on BI critical success factors and adoptability. Since this category was not an underlying category of BI;thus, it played the role of a moderating variable for the impact of critical success factors on adoptability in the final model. Research limitations/implications: Since this study is limited to about 100 SMEs in the north of Iran, results should be applied cautiously to SMEs in other countries. Generalizing the study's results to other industries and geographic regions should be done with care since management perceptions, and financial condition of a business vary significantly. Additionally, the topic of business intelligence in SMEs constrained the sample from the start since not all SMEs use business int lligence systems, and others are unaware of their advantages. BI tools enable the effective management of companies of all sizes by providing analytic data and critical performance indicators. In general, SMEs used fewer business intelligence technologies than big companies. According to studies, SMEs understand the value of simplifying their information resources to make critical business choices. Additionally, they are aware of the market's abundance of business intelligence products. However, many SMEs lack the technical knowledge necessary to choose the optimal tool combination. In light of the frequently significant investment required to implement BI approaches, a viable alternative for SMEs may be to adopt cloud computing solutions that enable organizations to strengthen their systems and information technologies on a pay-per-use basis while also providing access to cutting-edge BI technologies at a reasonable price. Practical implications: Before the implementation of Cloud BI in SMEs, condition of driver, competency and critical success factor of SMEs should also be considered. These will help to define the significant resources and skills that form the strategic edge and lead to the success of Cloud BI projects. Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been focused on factors such as critical success factors in cloud business intelligence and cloud computing in small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud business intelligence adoption models, the services used in cloud business intelligence, the factors involved in acceptance of cloud business intelligence, the challenges and advantages of cloud business intelligence, and drivers and barriers to cloud business intelligence. None of the studied resources proposed any comprehensive model for designing and implementing cloud business intelligence in small and medium-sized enterprises;they only investigated some of the aspects of this issue. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A model of business intelligence on cloud for managing SMEs in COVID-19 pandemic (Case: Iranian SMEs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During air travel, flight crew (flight attendants, pilots) can be exposed to numerous flight-related environmental DNA damaging agents that may be at the root of an excess risk of cancer and other diseases.

The number of cancelled surgical procedures owing to Covid-19, and the reintroduction of surgical acivirt, was modelled. METHODS: This was a modelling study using Hospital Episode Statistics data (2014C2019). Surgical procedures were grouped into four urgency classes. Expected numbers of surgical procedures performed between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021 were modelled. Procedure deficit was estimated using conservative assumptions and the gradual reintroduction of elective surgery from the 1 June 2020. Costs were calculated using NHS reference costs and are reported as millions or billions of euros. Estimates are reported with 95 per cent confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 547 534 (95 per cent c.i. 3 318 195 to 6 250 771) patients with a pooled mean age of 53.5 years were expected to undergo surgery between 1 March 2020 and 28 February 2021.

Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. Social distancing measures designed to limit COVID-19 transmission likely created unprecedented barriers for mothers to access social support. We explore how social support networks existed during the UKs first national lockdown amongst London mothers with infants, and their associations with postnatal depressive symptoms.MethodsUsing self-reported social network data from 162 London-based mothers with infants aged 6 months collected in May-June 2020 (during the first lockdown), we conduct a concurrent design mixed-method study. We quantitatively describe communication within maternal support networks, using quasi-Poisson regression models to analyse associations with postnatal depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In parallel, we thematically analyse open-text data to explore and understand the experiences of mothers with infants during Englands lockdown.ResultsQuantitative findings: Levels of depressive symptoms were high in our sample, with 47.5% of participants meeting the >=11EPDS cut-off for potential postnatal depression.On average, women kept in contact with 10C11 people remotely (via WhatsApp, Zoom etc), and saw one family member other than their partner, suggesting high compliance with lockdown rules. The number of seen in person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, negatively predicted depressive symptoms (RRR = 0.950 C 0.996 across models). However, a higher proportion of relatives seen in person was associated with increased depressive symptoms (RRR=1.003;95% CI 1.001C1.006), suggesting family members may have broken lockdown rules to support mums in need. Qualitative findings: We identified four themes. Some mothers in our sample felt lockdown protected family time which led to better bonding, often facilitated by high levels of support from the partner (theme 1). However, many experienced the burden of constant mothering without anyone around to help (theme 2). Mothers felt remote contact was not as good and led to reduced or inadequate support (theme 3). Mothers grieved for lost opportunities for them and their baby, and worried about the developmental impact on their baby (theme 4). Overall, these experiences coexisted with feelings of isolation, exhaustion, worry, inadequacy, guilt, and increased stress.ConclusionResults suggest the strict lockdown in the UK may have increased the risk of postnatal depression, reflected in the high levels of PND symptoms and poor maternal experiences in our sample.","output":"Communication across maternal social networks during the UKs national lockdown and its association with postnatal depressive symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: With the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year of 2020 the number of patients in need ofintensive care medicine increased dramatically in many countries. Several of them developed an acute respiratory distresssyndrome (ARDS) linked to the COVID-19 infection and many required the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO). Methods: We are retrospectively reviewing 141 patients who underwent ECMO for severe COVID-19-related ARDS in amulticenter study at 10 European ECMO centers. Result: A total of 141 patients (67.4% male, median age was 55.4 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 44-67.5) were treatedwith ECMO for confirmed (132) or suspected (9) severe COVID-19-related ARDS. Before ECMO, the median SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 9.0 (IQR: 7.0-11.5), median pH was 7.25 (IQR: 7.20-7.30), and medianPaO /FiO ratio was 70 mm Hg (IQR: 60-77). Venovenous ECMO was provided in 130 patients (92%) and venoarterial ECMO in 11 patients (8%) The median duration ofECMO treatment by now was 11 days, IQR: 7-17). At the time of reporting, 71 confirmed COVID-19 patients (53.8%) arealive, of whom 33 (43.4%) are still in the intensive care unit (9 on ECMO, 24 weaned from ECMO and extubated). Overallmortality so far occurred in 62 patients (46.2%). By now advanced age, low arterial pH, and low platelet count before ECMO were independent risk factors for increasedmortality during the intensive care treatment.

Drugs identified in this way may inhibit the entry and replication of pathogens in host cells. The SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has become the most contagious and deadly pandemic disease in the world today. In abeyance of any specific vaccine or therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2, the burgeoning situation urges a need for effective drugs to treat the virus-infected patients. Herbal medicines have been used as natural remedies for treating various infectious diseases since ancient times. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the attachment and pathogenesis of the virus. Therefore, this study focused on the search of useful ligands for S protein among active constituents present in common herbs that could serve as efficient remedies for COVID-19. We analysed the binding efficiency of twelve compounds present in common herbs with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular docking analysis and also results are validated with two different docking tools. The binding efficiency of ligands was scored based on their predicted pharmacological interactions coupled with binding energy estimates. In docking analysis, compound \\"I\\"(Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) was found to have the highest binding affinity with the viral S protein, followed by compounds, \\"F\\"(Curcumin),\\"D\\"(Apigenin) and \\"E\\"(Chrysophanol). The present study corroborates that compound \\"I\\"(EGCG) mostly present in the integrants of green tea, shows the highest potentiality for acting as an inhibitor of SARSCoV- 2. Further, characterization of the amino acid residues comprising the viral binding site and the nature of the hydrogen bonding involved in the ligand-receptor interaction revealed significant findings with herbal compound \\"I\\"(EGCG) binding to the S protein at eight amino acid residues. The binding sites are situated near to the amino acids which are required for virus pathogenicity. The findings of the present study need in vivo experiments to prove the utility of \\"I\\", \\"F\\",\\"D\\"and \\"E\\"compounds and their further use in making herb-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 product in near future.

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and MedRxiv databases were searched until May 1, 2020. We extracted data from eligible studies to summarize the clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of kidney injury on COVID-19 infection patients and further compared the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mean differences of three biomarkers between in ICU/severe and non-ICU/non-severe cases. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I(2) method. RESULTS: In the sum of 24 studies with 10180 patients were included in this analysis. The pooled prevalence of AKI, increased serum creatinine (Scr), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased D-dimer, proteinuria and hematuria in patients with COVID-19 were 16.2%, 8.3%, 6.2%, 49.8%, 50.1% and 30.3% respectively.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 57 moderate to severe COVID-19 positive KTR in a single center who received RDV as a part of COVID-19 management. No dose adjustments were done. The outcomes were measured as acute kidney injury (AKI) recovery; liver function tests abnormalities; other side effects; graft loss and death. RESULTS: The median (inter-quartile range) age of presentation was 44 (31-51) years. The duration from onset of symptoms to RDV initiation was 6 (5-7) days. Thirty-two (56%) cases received RDV on the day of admission. Forty-six (81%) cases were on oxygen support upon initiation of RDV. Thirty-eight (66.6%) cases had acute kidney injury on admission.

First, the impact on medical students is considered, particularly the trade-offs associated with online learning and the need to place greater pedagogical emphasis on virtual care delivery and other skills that will be increasingly in demand. Solutions described include greater utilization of technology, building more public health knowledge into the curriculum, and partnering with a wide range of academic disciplines. Second, leadership recruiting, vital to long-term success for AMCs, has been complicated by the crisis. Pressures discussed include adapting to the dynamics of competitive physician labor markets as well as attracting candidates with the skill sets to meet the requirements of a shifting AMC leadership landscape. Solutions proposed in this domain include making search processes more focused and streamlined, prioritizing creativity and flexibility as core management capabilities to be sought, and enhancing efforts with assistance from outside advisors. Finally, attention is devoted to the severe financial impact wrought by the pandemic, creating challenges whose resolution is central to planning future AMC directions. Specific challenges include recovery of lost clinical revenue and cash flow, determining how to deal with research funding, and the precarious economic balancing act engendered by the need to continue distance education.

Adult somatization has been linked to childhood trauma in both men and women. Among women, sexual trauma affects somatization level to a greater extent than non-sexual trauma. Early diagnosis of a somatization disorder would be of great help for both patients and society. The purpose of this scoping review is to map and summarize the literature on symptoms within somatization in women who have been sexually abused, and if any specific symptom can be linked to previous sexual abuse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A scoping review methodology was used. The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for original qualitative and quantitative research published between 2008 and 2019 that matched the objectives of the review. RESULTS: The database search identified 195 articles, of which 43 were retrieved in full text. Seven articles were included, involving 2076 women. All studies were quantitative. The included studies were heterogeneous. Four studies showed inconsistent findings regarding a link between sexual abuse and chronic or acute pain. Two studies showed an association between sexual abuse and increased incidence of somatic symptoms. One study showed an association between sexual abuse and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. No specific somatic symptoms in somatization were identifiable within the scope of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is to our knowledge the first scoping review on sexual abuse and symptoms of somatization. The findings suggest a link between sexual abuse and somatic symptoms, but the identified association with pain and irritable bowel syndrome is inconsistent.

The phenomenon of silent hypoxaemia has been described in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which is characterised by low oxygen saturation levels of <90% in those who appear clinically well and do not show signs of significant respiratory distress. Objectives. To assess the impact on clinical outcomes for high-risk COVID-19 patients using a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation levels in a home setting. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using data from a large South African insurance administrator. Patients were categorised as high risk, based on age and specific underlying clinical conditions, or from predictive models derived from medical scheme administrative claims data. The impact of pulse oximetry home monitoring on COVID-19 clinical outcomes was investigated by the use of Cox proportional hazard models. Results. Between 2 March 2020 and 31 October 2020, of 38 660 patients analysed, 8 115 were in the intervention group. The 60-day mortality rate for the evaluated high-risk population was 1.35%. After adjusting for age and comorbidity differences, the intervention group was found to have an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.52 (p<0.0001). No statistical significance was found between the intervened and control groups for admission to hospital, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and use of mechanical ventilation. The intervention group had a lower median C-reactive protein (CRP) level on admission (p=0.03). After adjustment for admission CRP levels, elevated CRP was associated with an increased mortality (p<0.0001), while the statistical significance in mortality between the intervention and the control group was lost. Conclusions. High-risk COVID-19 patients who used a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation levels had significantly lower mortality rates compared with other high-risk patients. The mortality benefit may be explained by earlier presentation to hospital, as suggested by lower initial CRP levels.","output":"The impact of routine pulse oximetry use on outcomes in COVID-19-infected patients at increased risk of severe disease: A retrospective cohort analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the mass production and consumption of single-use plastics and other plastic products, plastic waste management and its resulting microplastic pollution have become the most noteworthy environmental issues. The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)) in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133 tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.","output":"Analysis of plastic waste reduction and recycling in Taiwan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An introduction is presented in which the editor discusses articles in the issue on topics including the role of work-life balance as a source of stress for radiologists, anxiety and screening mammography, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast imaging.","output":"Stress and the Breast Imaging Workplace"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare neurological disorder of unknown etiology.

The article presents a comparative analysis of the morpho-functional and psychological state of women aged 35-42 years over the seven months of quarantine restrictions caused by the spread of COVID-19. Analysis of the data revealed significant negative changes in the indicators of physique and psychological state of women over this period. In women, body weight increased on average by 10.2% (p&lt;0.05), and waist and abdomen circumferences increased by 9.9% (p&lt;0.05) and 12.5% (p&lt;0.05), respectively. A lack of regular physical activity was one of the factors increasing the fat mass by 22.7% (p&lt;0.05) and decreasing the muscle mass by 23.9% (p&lt;0.05). In women, the zest for life decreased by 37.0% (p&lt;0.05) and the congruence between desired and achieved goals decreased by 64.6% (p&lt;0.05). The overall psychological state of women deteriorated by 39.4% (p&lt;0.05) and began to indicate a high level of emotional stress, low emotional stability, high level of anxiety, and psychological discomfort. Correlation analysis revealed high negative correlations between psychological and morphological indicators, which ranged from r=-0.321 (at p&lt;0.05) to r=-0.683 (at p&lt;0.001). The findings of this study suggest that a sedentary lifestyle and low level of physical activity over the quarantine restrictions period had a negative impact on the morpho-functional state and quality of life of women.

This study aims to evaluate the safety of remdesivir in this patient population. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study including patients  18 years old, admitted between May 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 who received remdesivir. Patients were divided into two groups: estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) < 30 mL/min and eCrCl  30 ml/min. Primary outcomes were development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after remdesivir initiation and hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] > 5  upper limit of normal) both at end of treatment (EOT) or 5 days after EOT. Secondary outcomes were length of stay (days) and mortality. RESULTS: 513 patients were assessed with 416 patients included in the study (eCrCl < 30 mL/min, n = 55; eCrCl  30 mL/min n = 361). Incidence of AKI (eCrCl < 30 mL/min 11% vs eCrCl  30 mL/min 7%, OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.57, 4.3) and hepatotoxicity (ALT: 2% vs 4%, OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.05, 3.7 and AST: 2% vs 2%, OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.14, 11.04) were similar between the two groups. Length of stay was longer in the eCrCl < 30 mL/min group (mean 18.6 vs 11.9, difference 6.7, 95% CI 3.8, 9.6), and no difference in mortality was observed (21.8% vs 18.8%, OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6, 2.4). CONCLUSION: Remdesivir was not associated with development of AKI or hepatotoxicity in patients with eCrCl < 30 mL/min compared to patients with eCrCl  30 mL/min, and warrants further investigation.","output":"Is remdesivir safe in patients with renal impairment?

Exposures to emergent suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic compound their chronic distress, which likely increased their vulnerability to psychological distress and may increase their risk for reduced work-related quality of life (WRQOL). OBJECTIVES This study examined the association between psychological distress and WRQOL among oncology nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional analysis of psychological distress and WRQOL among oncology nurses (N = 63) was conducted. FINDINGS The mean Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale score was 33.4, showing low depression levels, mild anxiety, and mild stress. The mean PTSD score was 29.3, and the mean WRQOL Scale score was 78.8.

Barrier protection at the time of this form of surgery has been used with varying results. The aim of this randomized study was to examine the efficacy of barrier retractional wound protection in the prevention of surgical site infections in open, elective colorectal surgery. METHODS One hundred thirty consecutive patients undergoing open elective colorectal resectional surgery were randomly assigned to have either barrier retractional wound protection or standard wound retraction. Patients were then followed up for a minimum of 30 days postoperatively. The primary end point was surgical site infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The secondary end point was performance of the wound protector as assessed by operating surgeons. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in the incidence of incisional surgical site infections when the wound protector was used: 3 of 64 (4.7%) vs 15 of 66 (22.7%); P = .004. Most surgical site infections were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital (78%), and there was no difference in the rates of reoperation, readmission, or formal wound drainage between the 2 groups. Surgeons found the wound protector to be helpful with retraction during surgery, with 88% (7/8) adopting it as part of their standard setup. CONCLUSIONS In this study the use of barrier wound protection in elective open colorectal resectional surgery resulted in a clinically significant reduction in incisional surgical site infections.

For this reason, we monitored the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in infected patients. In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients 2 weeks post-symptom onset and that the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2, we also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 samples from asymptomatic individuals that were shown SARS-CoV-2 seropositive using commercial serological tests. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau 2 weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients but they were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic patients. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 does not induce a prolonged neutralizing antibody response. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.","output":"Anti-spike, Anti-nucleocapsid and Neutralizing Antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 Inpatients and Asymptomatic Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Geriatric Day Hospital (GDH) is an important outpatient geriatric service, but there are few data on the role of frailty as a potential predictor of poor outcomes in this setting. Methods: Data were analyzed from 499 patients aged  60 years attending a 12-week GDH program between 2018 and 2021. Frailty status was defined as non-frail (68, 13.6%), mild/moderate frailty (351, 70.3%), and severe frailty (80, 16.0%) based on the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Outcomes were defined as (1) poor outcome (hospital readmission, death, or medical deterioration) during the program and (2) admission to permanent nursing home care upon completion of the program. Multivariate logistic models were used for predictive analyses. Results: The mean age was 80.3 (standard deviation 7.0); 58.3% were women. Overall, 77 patients (15.4%) had a poor outcome, and 48 (9.6%) were admitted to permanent nursing home care. Poor outcome was experienced by none of the non-frail patients (0%), by 49 (14.0%) patients with mild/moderate frailty, and 22 (27.5%) patients with severe frailty (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI 1.3, 3.2; p < 0.01).

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures. Results: Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures. Conclusions: For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures.

The current study aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on wellbeing using longitudinal data collected from the multi-ethnic Born in Bradford family cohort study. Methods: : Within-child changes in wellbeing were explored using data collected pre-pandemic and again during the first UK lockdown for 500 children aged 7-13 from a range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, using self-reported feelings of happiness and sadness. Associations between changes in wellbeing, demographic factors, quality of social relationships and physical activity levels were explored using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: : In this sample, 55% of children reported no change in their wellbeing from pre-pandemic to during the first lockdown (n=264). Children of Pakistani heritage were more than twice as likely to report feeling sad less often than White British children (RRR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.23, 5.51) during the first lockdown, and those who reported being left out by other children before the pandemic were over three times as likely than those who did not (RRR: 3.72: 1.51, 9.20) to report feeling sad less often during the pandemic. Around a third of children reported feeling happier (n=152, 31.6%), but these changes did not relate to any of the explanatory variables included in this analysis. Conclusion: Many children in this study reported no changes in their wellbeing during the first UK lockdown compared to before the pandemic and some described improved wellbeing. These findings suggest that children have coped well with the significant changes over the past year, though targeted support, particularly for those children who felt excluded before the pandemic, would be beneficial.","output":"Changes in childrens wellbeing in Bradford during COVID-19: The Born in Bradford COVID-19 longitudinal research study (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aims to understand the impact of Covid-19 on the collective memory among Malaysian generational cohorts.

Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts.

Compared with a single one, multiple PV stations collect sufficient fault samples, but their data is not allowed to be shared directly due to potential conflicts of interest. Therefore, federated learning can be exploited to train a collaborative fault diagnosis model. However, the modeling efficiency is seriously affected by the model update mechanism since each PV station has a different computing capability and amount of data. Moreover, for the safe and stable operation of the PV system, the robustness of collaborative modeling must be guaranteed rather than simply being processed on a central server. To address these challenges, a novel asynchronous decentralized federated learning (ADFL) framework is proposed. Each PV station not only trains its local model but also participates in collaborative fault diagnosis by exchanging model parameters to improve the generalization without losing accuracy. The global model is aggregated distributedly to avoid central node failure. By designing the asynchronous update scheme, the communication overhead and training time are greatly reduced.

Retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing and admission data in a health system. Patient-level data were assessed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling was used to identify features associated with increased male risk of severe outcomes. Results. In 213,175 SARS-CoV-2 tests, despite similar positivity rates (8.2%F vs 8.9%M), males were more frequently hospitalized (28%F vs 33%M). Of 2,626 hospitalized individuals, females had less severe presenting respiratory parameters and males had more fever. Comorbidity burden was similar, but with differences in specific conditions. Medications relevant for SARS-CoV-2 were used at similar frequency except tocilizumab (M>F). Males had higher inflammatory lab values. In a logistic regression model, male sex was associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes at 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95%CI 1.75, 5.18) and at peak status (OR 2.58, 95%CI 1.78,3.74) among 18-49 year-olds.

In Europe, the reinforced surveillance system relies on the complementary strengths of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. If the performances of pharmacovigilance monitoring are incomparable for the detection of safety signals relating to rare events of atypical presentation, it needs to be completed with pharmacoepidemiology activities for more common events, either multifactorial or frequently classified as idiopathic. The pharmacoepidemiological monitoring developed in Europe was elaborated before the first SARS-Cov-2 vaccines where marketed, taking into account the lessons learned from the vaccination campaign against 2009 A (H1N1) influenza.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequent organ damage in severe COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that human renal tubule cells could be the potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition.

In this preliminary analysis of an ongoing randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of sonothrombolysis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in STEMI patients with MVO, we sought to assess whether a difference could be observed between the treatment and control group with respect to the occurrence of early and late serious adverse events (SAE). Methods Patients with STEMI and persistent ST-elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) after PCI were randomized to sonothrombolysis (> 60 high mechanical index pulses in the apical 4-, 2- and 3-chamber view during an infusion of commercially available microbubbles) or sham (low mechanical index imaging with < 6 HMI pulses for perfusion imaging). All SAEs, defined according to the International guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), were recorded and divided in early (<1 month) and late (<6 months) SAEs. Results Forty-five patients were included in the trial. In total, 12 SAEs occurred: 4 in the sonothrombolysis group (2 early, 2 late), 8 in the control group (6 early, 2 late). In the sonothrombolysis group, the SAEs consisted of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal bleeding, collapse with subdural hematoma and endocarditis. In the control group, the listed SAEs were all-cause death (2x), hospitalization for heart failure, pneumonia, COVID-infection, diabetes mellitus, non ST-elevation myocardial infarction and aspecific chest paint. Conclusion Sonothrombolysis after PCI in patients with high-risk STEMI and MVO is not associated with an increased occurrence of early or late SAEs. Further clinical trials are needed to comment on the efficacy of sonothrombolysis in this patient population.","output":"Safety of Sonothrombolysis after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Patients with St-elevation Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID-19. METHODS: A global expert response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian ?-regression model was used to estimate 12-week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case-mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease), were determined. This case mix was applied to country-level surgical volumes. The 12-week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate the total number of cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28 404 603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19 (2 367 050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (902 per cent, 25 638 922 of 28 404 603). The overall 12-week cancellation rate would be 723 per cent. Globally, 817 per cent of operations for benign conditions (25 638 922 of 31 378 062), 377 per cent of cancer operations (2 324 070 of 6 162 311) and 254 per cent of elective caesarean sections (441 611 of 1 735 483) would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increased their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID-19 disruption. CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed owing to disruption caused by COVID-19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to restore surgical activity safely.","output":"Elective surgery cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic: global predictive modelling to inform surgical recovery plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities accessible in 15 minutes represent a new possibility for reorganizing the urban system (times, spaces and activities) to try to respond to many current challenges, including ageing populations, energy saving and, more recently, Covid-19. A renewed concept of urban accessibility, together with the redefinition of public spaces and \\"soft\\" ways of moving (pedestrian and cycle) to reach neighbourhood services, represent a starting point not only from which to face new challenges but also to rediscover the sense of community, especially at the neighbourhood scale. The 15-minute city draws its origins from the concept of the \\"neighbourhood unit\\", developed in 1923 in a competition for the city of Chicago, to define compact residential neighbourhoods where the proximity between services and homes contributed to set out the identity character of that part of the city and to create \\"the sense of belonging\\" of a community to a place. The events of the last year strongly re-propose experimentation with this approach, also following the proposal by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, aimed at giving a new face to Paris starting from the creation of extensive pedestrian green areas on the large boulevards that are now crossed by the cars and, therefore, to allow the inhabitants to reach, by walking, essential urban services within the 15-minute threshold. Other cities, such as New York and Milan, have also begun to work to make their neighbourhoods, especially peripheral ones, accessible in 15 minutes on foot or by bicycle, without neglecting the goal of transforming these neighbourhoods into attractive places for social gathering for local communities. In this perspective, the research work aims at identifying the urban characteristics that define a 15-minute city, starting from the cities that are launching this experimentation. Among the urban characteristics, the geomorphological, physical (concerning both the spaces and the paths, such as the geometry of the pedestrian and cycle networks), functional (distribution and location of services), socio-economic (of the population) and settlement ones are taken into consideration. According to the weights of the variables identified as significant, the work defines different areas accessible in 15 minutes based on users' willingness to walk and the geomorphological, physical, settlement and functional characteristics identified in each urban area. The work is carried out in selected districts of the city of Naples which, due to their demographic, morphological and settlement characteristics, make them a significant area of experimentation. ? 2022 The Authors.

Identifying poor prognostic factors is helpful for risk stratification. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the association between severe COVID-19 and a change in white blood cell (WBC) count, an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP), and fever. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and an elevation of CRP. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through April 20th, 2020. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the study size (>200 or <200) and median age (>55 or <55). Meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine possible sources of heterogeneity. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and CRP. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 3278 patients were selected. Fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP were associated with poor outcomes (OR (95% CI) 1.63 (1.06-2.51), 4.51 (2.53-8.04), and 11.97 (4.97-28.8), respectively). Leukopenia was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.78). Sensitivity analyses showed similar tendencies. Meta-regression analysis for leukocytosis indicated that age, dyspnea, and hypertension contributed to heterogeneity. The pooled area under the leukocytosis and CRP curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, fever, leukocytosis, and an elevated CRP were associated with severe outcomes. Leukocytosis and CRP on arrival may predict poor outcomes.","output":"Value of leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein in predicting severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionPregnant women are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to several factors and therefore require special attention.

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance. MAIN RESULTS We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between dressing types for any secondary outcomes assessed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently no robust evidence for differences between wound dressings for any outcome in foot ulcers in people with diabetes (treated in any setting). Practitioners may want to consider the unit cost of dressings, their management properties and patient preference when choosing dressings.","output":"Dressings for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes: an overview of systematic reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous human disorders can benefit from targeted, intravenous (IV) drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles have been designed to undergo systemic circulation and deliver their therapeutic cargo to target sites in a controlled manner. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is a particularly promising biomaterial for designing intravenous drug carriers due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and history of clinical success across other routes of administration. Despite these merits, PLGA remains markedly absent in clinically approved intravenous (IV) drug delivery formulations. A prominent factor in PLGA's inability to succeed intravenously may lie in the hydrophobic character of the polyester, leading to the adsorption of serum proteins (i.e., opsonization) and a cascade of events that end in premature clearance from the bloodstream. PEGylation, or surface-attached polyethylene glycol chains, is a common strategy for shielding particles from opsonization. PEG continues to be regarded as the ultimate \\"stealth\\" solution despite the lack of clinical progress of PEGylated PLGA carriers. This review reflects on some of the reasons for the clinical failure of PLGA, particularly the drawbacks of PEGylation, and highlights alternative surface coatings on PLGA particles. Ultimately, a new approach will be needed to harness the potential of PLGA nanoparticles and allow their widespread clinical adoption. This article is protected by copyright.

The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively.

Because of the harm that parasites can inflict on man and domesticated animals, which can be expressed as economic loss, many parasites become pests. In natural ecosystems, parasites contribute to the prevention of continuous exponential growth of populations and, therefore, they also need to be conserved. The exotic pet trade may result in translocation of exotic species together with their microparasites and macroparasites, potentiating a risk of transmission of exotic diseases to native fauna and to humans. Within this context we need to increase our knowledge of parasites and parasitic diseases of wildlife. Prevention seems to be the choice for managing parasite exposure. This may be achieved through educational programs that refocused on discouraging people to import exotic pets, together with stronger legislative measures to control wildlife trade.","output":"Parasites, Pests, and Pets in a Global World: New Perspectives and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory tract infections are frequent and usually self-limited illnesses.

For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, need for acute care and, rarely, death. Viral respiratory tract infections, most frequently with rhinovirus, are the predominant microorganisms associated with asthma exacerbations. Evidence is also emerging that deficiencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier may make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation.

METHODS: A series of CpG ODN with different primary structures were synthesized. Their capabilities to stimulate mouse spleen cell proliferation were determined by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, and IFN-) secretion spectra induced by CpG ODN were assessed by ELISA. The ability of CpG ODN to activate natural killer cells was evaluated by standard 4 h (51)Cr-release assay. Flow cytometry was utilized to examine the expressions of various lymphocyte surface molecules on diverse immunocytes. An effective CpG ODN for murine, ODN1826, was set as the template of modification and the positive control. RESULTS: The immunostimulatory activities of CpG ODN with different sequences and compositions varied markedly, both in character and in extent. It was useless for improving the immunostimulatory activity of ODN1826 by simply increasing the functional hexameric CpG motif number, modifying the site of CpG motifs, or changing the distance between multi-CpG motifs. However, an addition of a self-complementary palindrome structure at the 3-end, but not the 5-end of CpG ODN, aroused marked improvement in its activity. Several designed ODN had superior comprehensive immunostimulatory properties compared to ODN1826. CONCLUSION: The immunostimulatory activity of a CpG ODN was relevant to its primary structure. It was useless for promoting immunostimulatory activity to simply change CpG motif number, space, or distance.

The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to study how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to government policies and to analyze how different policies have produced different results on public health. METHODS: Considering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by each government, we built an agent-based model to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case-fatality rates. The model we implemented provides the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (eg, keeping the national borders closed or increasing the ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection. RESULTS: The 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for COVID-19, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual second wave, while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is also reflected in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In line with what we expected, the obtained results showed that the countries that have taken restrictive measures in terms of limiting the population mobility have managed more successfully than others to contain the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the model demonstrated that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries that have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.","output":"An Agent-Based Model of the Local Spread of SARS-CoV-2: Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outcomes of patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have dramatically improved over the past 20 years. Earlier identification of IA and prompter treatment institution have been key advancements, promoted by the constitution of Early Arthritis Clinics (EAC) and the development of more sensitive classification criteria for RA. The outbreak of new COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become a global health emergency and has forced a rearrangement in the management of other non-COVID-19 diseases. The impact of the lock-down of the healthcare systems on chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA is expected to be significant but is at present unknown. Objectives: To assess the effects of the lock-down imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the referral and clinical presentation of patients with new-onset RA. Methods: Data were retrieved from the Pavia EAC inception cohort, established in 2005 for the early identification of patients with new-onset IA. Referral criteria to the EAC include: 3 swollen joints (SJ) and/or <3 SJ and positive squeeze test and/or <3 SJ and morning stiffness 30 min. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are assessed at baseline and regularly over follow-up. At 31 Dec 2020, the Pavia EAC collects information on 2.508 patients. For this study, baseline characteristics of the patients referred in the semester following the COVID-19 lock-down (Jul-Dec 2020) were compared with: (i) patients referred in the semester immediately preceding the lock-down (Jul-Dec 2019);(ii) patients referred in the semester following the publication of the 2010 RA classification criteria (Jan-Jun 2011);(iii) patients referred in the semester preceding the publication of the 2010 criteria (Jul-Dec 2009). Results: In the semester following the lock-down imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease in the referral of patients with new-onset suspected IA compared with previous periods (n=71 vs n=91 in the semester before the lock-down, n=96 in the first semester of 2011, n=101 in the second semester of 2009). Furthermore, fewer of the referred patients fulfilled RA criteria at presentation (36.6% vs 44.3%, 46.5% and 42.9% in the other semesters). Among patients with RA, more were autoantibody-positive (72% vs 50%, 49.1% and 52.2%). There was a trend for increased diagnostic delay in the overall cohort of RA after the COVID-19 lock-down (Figure 1A). The delay was particularly longer in autoantibody-positive patients, returning to the values seen before the introduction of the 2010 RA criteria (Figure 1B). In contrast, the few autoantibody-negative patients were referred earlier (Figure 1C). Disease activity at presentation was significantly higher in RA patients presenting after the lock-down compared with the progressive trend for reduction observed over the previous years, irrespective of the autoantibody status (Figure 1D-F). Such increase was determined by an inversion of the trend towards lower levels of objective parameters of inflammation, such as the swollen joint count (Figure 1G-I) and acute phase reactants, and a further increase in the secular trend towards worsening of patient-derived measures, such as the tender joint count and patient global assessment (Figure 1J-L). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges in the management of patients suffering from chronic diseases. RA has returned to be diagnosed outside the window of opportunity, with a significantly higher inflammatory burden at presentation. The many benefits of early diagnosis, which have dramatically changed the outcomes of autoantibody-positive RA, are at risk of vanishing in short times. Equally important, autoantibody-negative RA is at risk of further under-diagnosis and under-treatment.","output":"Missing the window of opportunity: Early arthritis clinics in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a continuation of our earlier work against SARS-CoV-2, seven FDA-approved drugs were designated as the best SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2-o-methyltransferase (2OMTase) inhibitors through 3009 compounds. The in silico inhibitory potential of the examined compounds against SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2-o-methyltransferase (PDB ID: (6W4H) was conducted through a multi-step screening approach. At the beginning, molecular fingerprints experiment with SAM (S-Adenosylmethionine), the co-crystallized ligand of the targeted enzyme, unveiled the resemblance of 147 drugs. Then, a structural similarity experiment recommended 26 compounds. Therefore, the 26 compounds were docked against 2OMTase to reveal the potential inhibitory effect of seven promising compounds (Protirelin, (1187), Calcium folinate (1913), Raltegravir (1995), Regadenoson (2176), Ertapenem (2396), Methylergometrine (2532), and Thiamine pyrophosphate hydrochloride (2612)). Out of the docked ligands, Ertapenem (2396) showed an ideal binding mode like that of the co-crystallized ligand (SAM). It occupied all sub-pockets of the active site and bound the crucial amino acids. Accordingly, some MD simulation experiments (RMSD, RMSF, R(g), SASA, and H-bonding) have been conducted for the 2OMTaseErtapenem complex over 100 ns. The performed MD experiments verified the correct binding mode of Ertapenem against 2OMTase exhibiting low energy and optimal dynamics. Finally, MM-PBSA studies indicated that Ertapenem bonded advantageously to the targeted protein with a free energy value of ?43 KJ/mol. Furthermore, the binding free energy analysis revealed the essential amino acids of 2OMTase that served positively to the binding. The achieved results bring hope to find a treatment for COVID-19 via in vitro and in vivo studies for the pointed compounds.","output":"Ligand and Structure-Based In Silico Determination of the Most Promising SARS-CoV-2 nsp16-nsp10 2-o-Methyltransferase Complex Inhibitors among 3009 FDA Approved Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been one of the most significant challenges to humankind in centuries. The extremely contagious nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has put forth an immense pressure on the health sector. In order to mitigate the stress on the healthcare systems especially to battle the crisis of mechanical ventilators, we have designed a modular, and robust DIY ventilator, ATMO-Vent (Atmospheric Mixture Optimization Ventilator) which can be fully mounted within two days by two operators. The ATMO-Vent has been designed using low-cost, robust, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, with many features comparable to a full-fledged ventilator. ATMO-Vent has been designed based on the United Kingdom Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK-MHRA) guidelines for Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System (RMVS), yet scalable to the specific requirements of different countries. ATMO-Vent is capable of adjusting the Fraction of Inspiratory Oxygen (FiO2) levels, Tidal Volume (TV), frequency of breaths, Inspiratory/Expiratory ratio (I/E), Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). ATMO-Vent can operate in two modes - Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (CMV) using Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV) and in Assisted Control (AC) mode with pressure triggered by the patient. ATMO-Vent has undergone rigorous testing and qualifies under Class B Electric and Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) requirements of EN 55011 CISPR 11 standards.","output":"ATMO-Vent: an adapted breathing atmosphere for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of a coronavirus infection in a litter of 10-week-old poodle pups from a commercial kennel is described.

This type of invasion is exhibited by a variety of cancer types, and very frequently is found in pancreatic cancer. The microscopic size of nerve fibers within mouse pancreas renders the study of PNI difficult in orthotopic murine models. Here, we describe a heterotopic in vivo model of PNI, where we inject syngeneic pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02-H7 into the murine sciatic nerve. In this model, sciatic nerves of anesthetized mice are exposed and injected with cancer cells. The cancer cells invade in the nerves proximally toward the spinal cord from the point of injection. The invaded sciatic nerves are then extracted and processed with OCT for frozen sectioning. H&E and immunofluorescence staining of these sections allow quantification of both the degree of invasion and changes in protein expression. This model can be applied to a variety of studies on PNI given its versatility. Using mice with different genetic modifications and/or different types of cancer cells allows for investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PNI and for different cancer types.

The presented study summarizes the relevant state of the art in both research areas and lays out how their respective accomplishments can be combined to achieve higher degrees of autonomy in robotic construction within the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. A distributed control and communication infrastructure for agent training and task execution is presented, that leverages the potentials of combining tools, standards and algorithms of both fields. It is geared towards industrial CDRF applications. Using this framework, a robotic agent is trained to autonomously plan and build structures using two model-free DRL algorithms (TD3, SAC) in two case studies: robotic block stacking and sensor-adaptive 3D printing. The first case study serves to demonstrate the general applicability of computational design environments for DRL training and the comparative learning success of the utilized algorithms. Case study two highlights the benefit of our setup in terms of tool path planning, geometric state reconstruction, the incorporation of fabrication constraints and action evaluation as part of the training and execution process through parametric modeling routines. The study benefits from highly efficient geometry compression based on convolutional autoencoders (CAE) and signed distance fields (SDF), real-time physics simulation in CAD, industry-grade hardware control and distinct action complementation through geometric scripting.

There have been extensive researches on how the -CoVs nsp1 regulates viral virulence by inhibiting host protein synthesis, but the regulatory mechanism of the -CoVs nsp1 is still unclear. Here, we report the 2.1-? full-length crystal structure of nsp1 in emerging porcine SADS-CoV and the 1.8-? full-length crystal structure of nsp1 in the highly lethal cat FIPV. Although they belong to different subtypes of -CoVs, these viruses all have a bucket-shaped fold composed of six -sheets, similar to the crystal structure of PEDV and TGEV nsp1. Comparing the above four structures, we found that the structure of -CoVs nsp1 in the same subtype was more conserved. We then selected mammalian cells that were treated with SADS-CoV and FIPV nsp1 for RNA sequencing analysis and found that nsp1 had a specific inhibitory effect on interferon (IFN) and cell cycle genes. Using the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) assay and Western blotting, we confirmed that seven representative -CoVs nsp1s could significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT1-S727 and interfere with the effect of IFN-I. Moreover, the cell cycle experiment confirmed that -CoVs nsp1 could encourage host cells to stay in the G0/G1 phase. Based on these findings, we not only greatly improved the crystal structure data on -CoVs nsp1, but we also speculated that -CoVs nsp1 regulated host proliferation and immune evasion-related biological functions by inhibiting the synthesis of host proteins, thus creating an environment conducive to the virus.","output":"Structural and Biological Basis of Alphacoronavirus nsp1 Associated with Host Proliferation and Immune Evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Influenza virus and S. pneumoniae infections in cancer patients (pts) are responsible of a higher morbidity and mortality rates. Limited data are available about safety, efficacy, immunogenicity and timing of influenza (I) and pneumococcal (P) vaccine (vax) in pts receiving active treatment. However, I and P vax in cancer pts and their family members (FMs) are reccomended. Methods: This is a single institution prospective study conducted at L. Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) between Sept 20 and Apr 21. The aim was to assess efficacy and safety of vax. Cancer pts, age>18yo, in active antineoplastic treatment and FMs age>18yo were included. Each pt received I+P vax on the same day of therapy. Any local and systemic Adverse Event (AE), episode of Influenza Like Illness (ILI), pneumococcal infection (PI), access to Emergency Department (ED) or Hospital admission (HA) and delay of therapy (DoT) were recorded. The frequency of AEs, ILI episodes and PI among pts and age- and gender- matching FMs were compared. Results: 194 pts (63y median age, 67.5% female) and 140 FMs (59y median age, 49% female) were enrolled. CANCER: 92% solid and 8% hematological malignancy, 69% metastatic stage. TREATMENTS: 54% 1 previous line of therapy;38% chemotherapy, 31% target, 17% chemo+target, 14% hormone therapy. VAX: I-vax received for first time in 47% pts and 72% FMs. 100% pts and 49% FMs received I+P-vax. LOCAL AEs: I-vax: 34% pts and 19.6% FMs (p=0.01). P-vax: 35.7% pts and 20.7% FMs (p=0.11). The most common was pain in site of injection. SISTEMIC AEs: 19.6% pts and 8.5% FMs (p=0.11);the most frequent was fatigue. EFFICACY: ILI were recorded in 8.8% pts (3 had a HA and 1 a DoT) and 3.6% FMs (p=0.04). No PI was recorded. In a logistic regression analysis type of therapy, previous treatment and the use of steroid dont significantly impact on vax safety and efficacy. Conclusions: Few ILI events were observed due to vax and probably to all measures adopted to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus spread. Except for local I-vax AEs, no differences were observed in efficacy and safety between the 2 groups. During the observation time, >70% of cancer pts in active treatment received I and P vax, so the vaccination coverage was achieved, reducing the pressure on territorial healthcare system.

While this impact has been well-recognized in certain age groups, the effects, both direct and indirect, on the neonatal population remain largely unknown. There are placental changes associated, though the contributions to maternal and fetal illness have not been fully determined. The rate of premature delivery has increased and SARS-CoV-2 infection is proportionately higher in premature neonates, which appears to be related to premature delivery for maternal reasons rather than an increase in spontaneous preterm labor. There is much room for expansion, including long-term data on outcomes for affected babies. Though uncommon, there has been evidence of adverse events in neonates, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C). There are recommendations for reduction of viral transmission to neonates, though more research is required to determine the role of passive immunization of the fetus via maternal vaccination. There is now considerable evidence suggesting that the severe visitation restrictions implemented early in the pandemic have negatively impacted the care of the neonate and the experiences of both parents and healthcare professionals alike. Ongoing collaboration is required to determine the full impact, and guidelines for future management. IMPACT: Comprehensive review of current available evidence related to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neonates, effects on their health, impact on their quality of care and indirect influences on their clinical course, including comparisons with other age groups.

The goal was to identify the obstacles that appeared in online classes for musical instruments, but also the advantages that, according to the teachers, may be integrated into traditional classes once the pandemic is over. The research was based on a sample of 220 teachers of elementary music schools, combining a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained data. The results have shown that teachers, younger ones in particular, overcome the obstacles of online teaching without major difficulties. As to the particular difficulties they encountered, the teachers most often mentioned those of a technical nature, and the inability to properly work on the techniques of playing an instrument due to the lack of a direct contact with the students. Almost all of the teachers feel that the students cannot improve their skills through online classes as effectively as in a regular class. However, in their future work, the teachers would continue to make audio and video recordings of themselves and their students playing, and practice online teaching when the students are sick or otherwise unable to attend regular classes.

Despite resistance to wear masks, the global public health response has beaten the grimmer projections of millions of deaths. The present study seeks to analyze the survival of COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital and identify the risk factors of mortality. METHODS: Medical records of 1233 RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital between 01 April and 30 September 2020 were retrospectively analyzed for calculating overall survival and to investigate the independent predictors of survival of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 72 (5.8%) deaths; which occurred in 24.9% of the elderly (age > 60yrs) people (P < 0.001), 76.0% in people with multiple comorbidities (having more than one comorbidity) (P < 0.001), 75.6% in people with diabetes (P < 0.001), and 75.5% in people with hypertension (P < 0.001). A significantly higher risk of mortality was observed in elderly patients, patients with comorbidities, and patients requiring oxygen while admitted in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Survival reflects the cure rates and is used by health professionals and policymakers to plan and implement disease control measures.

Catalase (CAT) is an oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen and water, thereby protecting the cell from oxidative damage. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of maternal CAT supplementation on reproductive performance, antioxidant enzyme activities, mineral transport, and the mRNA expression of related genes in sows and offspring. It was observed that giving dietary CAT supplementation to pregnant sows may decrease the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) rate and contribute to improving the maternal and fetal antioxidant status, potentially by modulating the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes and mRNA expression of related genes, as well as the transport of some mineral elements in the pregnant sows and their piglets. This finding provides a reasonable foundation for focused intervention studies in the future and may also provide insight into important aspects of mother-infant nutrition in both animals and humans. ABSTRACT: This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of maternal catalase (CAT) supplementation on reproductive performance, antioxidant enzyme activities, mineral transport, and mRNA expression of related genes in sows and offspring. A total of 40 pregnant sows at 95 days of gestation with similar parity (3C5 parities) and back-fat thickness were assigned randomly and equally into the control (CON) group (fed a basal diet) and CAT group (fed a basal diet supplemented with 660 mg/kg CAT; CAT activity, 280 U/g). The reproductive performance was recorded, and the placenta and blood samples of sows and neonatal piglets, as well as the jejunum and ileum samples from neonatal boars (eight replicates per group), were collected. Results showed that dietary supplementation with CAT significantly decreased the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) rate and increased the activity of serum CAT in neonatal piglets and umbilical cords (p < 0.05). In addition, CAT supplementation tended to improve total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels in the maternal serum (p = 0.089) and umbilical cords of piglets (p = 0.051).

The pestilence returned to Western Europe in several waves, between the 16th and 17th centuries. William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet and other tragedies, and Ben Jonson in The Alchemist made several references to the plague, but they did not offer any realistic description of that infective disease. Some decennials later Daniel Defoe, in his A Journal of the Plague Year (1719), gave a detailed report about the Great Plague which hit England in 1660, based on documents of the epoch. In more recent times, Thomas S. Eliot, composing his poem The Waste Land was undoubtedly influenced by the spreading of another infective disease, the so-called Spanish flu, which affected him and his wife in December 1918. Some decennials later, the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus, in his novel The Plague, symbolized with a plague epidemic the war which devastated Europe, North Africa and the Far East from 1937 to 1945, extolling a death toll of over 50 million victims.

We term the calculated electrical demand ESPENI that is an acronym for Elexon Sum Plus Embedded Net Imports. The method adds value to the original data by combining both transmission and distribution generation data into a single dataset and adding ISO 8601 compatible datetimes to increase interoperability with other timeseries data. Data cleansing is undertaken by visually flagging data errors and then using simple linear interpolation to impute values to replace the flagged data. Publishing the method allows it to be further enhanced or adapted and to be considered and critiqued by a wider community. In addition, the published raw and cleaned data is a valuable resource that saves researchers considerable time in repeating the steps presented in the method to prepare the data for further analysis.

DESIGN: This was a rapid quality-improvement initiative using public health decrees, a HIPAA-compliant and device-agnostic telemedicine patform, and a group of out-of-state intensivist volunteers to enhance critical care support. Telecritical care volunteers initially provided on-demand consults but then shifted to round twice daily with housestaff in a 12-bed newly created ICU. SETTING: A 457-bed safety net hospital in the Bronx, NY, during the pandemic. SUBJECTS: The 12-bed newly created ICU was staffed by a telecritical care attending, a cardiology fellow, and internal medicine residents. INTERVENTION: Prior to the intervention, the ad hoc ICU was staffed by a cardiology fellow as the attending of record, with critical care support on demand. The intervention involved twice daily rounding with an out-of-state, volunteer intensivist. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Volunteers logged 352 encounters. Data from 26 unique encounters during the initial on-demand consult pilot study of tele-ICU support were recorded. The most common interventions were diagnostic test interpretation, ventilator management, and sedation change. The majority of housestaff felt the new tele-ICU service improved the quality of care of patients and decreased anxiety of taking care of complex patients. Likewise, the majority of volunteers expressed making significant alterations to care, and 100% believed critical care input was needed for these patients. The largest lessons learned centered around mandating the use of the telecritical care volunteers and integration into a structured format of rounding. CONCLUSIONS: The need for rapid implementation of ICUs during a major public health crisis can be challenging. Our pilot study supports the feasibility of using an out-of-state telecritical care service to support ICUs, particularly in areas where resources are limited.","output":"Rapid Implementation of Telecritical Care Support During a Pandemic: Lessons Learned During the Coronavirus Disease 2020 Surge in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of the annual fireworks-related injury surveillance data collected by the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) in 2010-2014 was conducted to describe the profile of such injuries in the Philippines.

A case was defined as any person who had sustained injury from fireworks in any form within the 16-day surveillance period (21 December to 5 January) and had presented to any of the 50 sentinel hospitals. Of the 4649 cases, there were 4706 fireworks-related injuries involving 5076 anatomic sites in 2010-2014. A significant decrease of cases in 2014 was observed when compared with the previous study years (P = 0.02). The number of cases peaked at public holidays. Males (80%) were more commonly injured, and children aged 5 to 14 years were primarily affected (47%). Ignition of illegal fireworks accounted for half (50%) of the injuries; most injuries (68%) occurred in street settings. The majority of injuries (57%) were sustained by fireworks igniters. The most common anatomic injury sites were hands (44%), legs (21%) and eyes (14%). Illegal fireworks were related to 100% (4/4) of the deaths and 49% (105/214) of the cases who needed amputations. Fireworks-related injuries declined significantly in 2014. Public awareness campaigns may have contributed to reducing the injury occurrences.

Assessment of chronic consequences of TBI must distinguish between effects of age and injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice receive single closed head injury (CHI) and are analyzed at 14DPI or 180DPI for cortical atrophy and 7DPI or 180DPI for behavioral outcomes. Results CHI induces ipsilesional atrophy at 14DPI that increases 180 DPI due to an effect of age. On open field, injured mice develop a turn bias at 180DPI not present at 7DPI. On rotarod, injured mice have shorter latencies at 7DPI, but not at 180DPI due to worsening performance of aging uninjured mice. On beam walk, both groups at 180DPI more slowly traverse a 2cm and 1cm beam than at 7DPI. Foot-faults show no significant effects of age or injury. Limb position was assessed using Deeplabcut? markerless tracking followed by computation of absition (integral of limb displacement over time) using custom Python scripts. On the 2cm beam, age increased absition in all limbs of uninjured mice and both forelimbs of injured mice. Injury increased left hindlimb absition at 7DPI. On the 1cm beam both forelimbs and the left hindlimb of injured mice at 180DPI have larger absition than uninjured mice at 180DPI or injured mice at 7DPI.

We sought a holistic understanding of the severe/mild distinction in COVID-19 pathology, and its origins. We performed a wholeblood preserving single-cell analysis protocol to integrate contributions from all major cell types including neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, lymphocytes and the contents of serum. Patients with mild COVID-19 disease display a coordinated pattern of interferonstimulated gene (ISG) expression across every cell population and these cells are systemically absent in patients with severe disease. Severe COVID-19 patients also paradoxically produce very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and have lower viral load as compared to mild disease. Examination of the serum from severe patients demonstrates that they uniquely produce antibodies with multiple patterns of specificity against interferon-stimulated cells and that those antibodies functionally block the production of the mild disease-associated ISG-expressing cells.

We need an objective assessment to differentiate between organic gastrointestinal diseases and functional bowel symptoms. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of fecal calprotectin (FC) in predicting organic gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS: In a prospective observational study, consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy to the Department of Medicine and Geriatrics at the Kwong Wah Hospital in Hong Kong were recruited. Stool samples were collected within 24 h before colonoscopy. FC was measured by a commercial kit. Upper endoscopy investigations were then proceeded if normal colonoscopy but elevated FC. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy out of 429 patients had FC above 50 g/g. Eighty\\\\six out of 270 with elevated FC had significant colonoscopy pathological findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of FC test for diagnosing a significant organic colonoscopy or upper endoscopy disease were 91.7, 55.6, 57.0, and 91.2%, respectively. The NPV of FC for colorectal cancer, high risk polyp, and colon inflammation were 98.7, 96.2, and 98.1%, respectively. The NPV of FC in the condition of altered bowel habit or abdominal pain in predicting colorectal cancer and inflammation were 93.8 and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FC is a reliable marker of ruling out organic bowel diseases.

We aimed to assess the classification performance of computed tomography (CT)-based CT signs and radiomics features for discriminating COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 154 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia (COVID-19: 89 cases, influenza pneumonia: 65 cases) were collected retrospectively in this study. Pneumonia signs and radiomics features were extracted from the initial unenhanced chest CT images to build independent and combined models. The predictive performance of the radiomics model, CT sign model, the combined model was constructed based on the whole dataset and internally invalidated by using 1000-times bootstrap. Diagnostic performance of the models was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The combined models consisted of 4 significant CT signs and 7 selected features and demonstrated better discrimination performance between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia than the single radiomics model. For the radiomics model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.888 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 78.4%; accuracy, 83.1%), and the AUC was 0.906 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 81.5%; accuracy, 84.4%) in the CT signs model. After combining CT signs and radiomics features, AUC of the combined model was 0.959 (sensitivity, 89.9%; specificity, 90.7%; accuracy, 90.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CT-based radiomics combined with signs might be a potential method for distinguishing COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia with satisfactory performance.

The present work used a qualitative approach and was designed as a case study to identify social values and behaviors in the context of community resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited five informants and obtained data through interviews and observation. The results showed that community resilience emerged from a sense of belonging to the group (i.e., the residents) and its members. The residents have inherited social values and behaviors that have long lived in the community which render them resilient against the COVID-19 pandemic. Such values include cooperation deliberation and harmony with nature whereas the social behaviors manifest in obedience and prosocial neighborhood. The implication of these findings is a hope that the residents can build community resilience. The residents may initiate such joint effort from the hamlet or village environment where they can build community resilience by developing social values and behaviors that grow in the community.Masyarakat memiliki kekuatan budaya berupa nilai-nilai dan perilaku yang berfungsi secara efektif untuk beradaptasi dan berhasil dalam menghadapi bencana.

We aimed to determine the presence of these rare variants in young men with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively studied males between 18 and 50 years-old without predisposing comorbidities that required at least high-flow nasal oxygen to treat COVID-19. The coding region of TLR7 was sequenced to assess the presence of potentially deleterious variants. RESULTS: TLR7 missense variants were identified in two out of 14 patients (14.3%). Overall, the median age was 38 (IQR 30-45) years. Both variants were not previously reported in population control databases and were predicted to be damaging by in silico predictors. In a 30-year-old patient a maternally inherited variant [c.644A>G; p.(Asn215Ser)] was identified, co-segregating in his 27-year-old brother who also contracted severe COVID-19. A second variant [c.2797T>C; p.(Trp933Arg)] was found in a 28-year-old patient, co-segregating in his 24-year-old brother who developed mild COVID-19. Functional testing of this variant revealed decreased type I and II interferon responses in peripheral mononuclear blood cells upon stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod, confirming a loss-of-function effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a rationale for the genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young men with severe COVID-19 in the absence of other relevant risk factors. A diagnosis of TLR7 deficiency could not only inform on treatment options for the patient, but also enables pre-symptomatic testing of at-risk male relatives with the possibility of instituting early preventive and therapeutic interventions.","output":"Genetic Screening for TLR7 Variants in Young and Previously Healthy Men With Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To describe the pattern of the use of advanced radiation therapy (RT) techniques, including intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic body RT (SBRT) for the management of bone metastases (BM), and the associated factors in Victoria. METHODS: We used a population-based cohort of patients from the state-wide Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Data Set (VRMDS) who received RT for BM between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome was proportion of RT courses using advanced RT techniques. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate temporal trend in advanced RT use. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with advanced RT use. RESULTS: A total of 18,158 courses of RT were delivered to 10,956 patients-16,626 (91.6%) courses were 3D conformal RT, 857 (4.7%) IMRT/VMAT and 675 (3.7%) SBRT. There was a sharp increase in IMRT/VMAT use from <1% in 2012-2015, to 10.1% in 2016 and 16.3% in 2017 (P-trend < 0.001). Increase in SBRT use was more gradual, from 1.2% in 2012 to 4.8% in 2016 and 5.5% in 2017 for SBRT (P-trend<0.001). In multivariate analyses, year of RT was the strongest predictor of IMRT/VMAT use (OR = 41; 95%CI = 25-67; P < 0.001, comparing 2012-2013 and 2016-2017). Primary tumour type (prostate cancer) was the strongest predictor of SBRT use (OR = 6.07; 95% CI = 4.19-8.80; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, there was increasing trend in the use of advanced RT techniques for BM in Victoria, with a distinct pattern for IMRT/VMAT compared with SBRT - SBRT uptake was more gradual while IMRT/VMAT uptake was abrupt, occurring contemporaneously with Medicare Benefit Scheme funding changes in 2016.","output":"Patterns of the use of advanced radiation therapy techniques for the management of bone metastases and the associated factors in Victoria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a huge change in daily functioning in millions of people worldwide.

The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: \\"On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?\\" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

We searched 8 electronic databases to identify studies comparing patients receiving a specific protocol of early mobilization to a control group. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Downs and Black tool. RESULTS Four studies in abdominal surgery (3 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 1 observational prospective study) and 4 studies in thoracic surgery (3 RCTs and 1 observational retrospective study) were identified. None of the 5 studies evaluating postoperative complications reported differences between groups. One of 4 studies evaluating duration of stay reported a significant decrease in the intervention group. One of 3 studies evaluating gastrointestinal function reported differences in favor of the intervention group. One of 4 studies evaluating performance-based outcomes reported differences in favor of the intervention group.

For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. Methods: A multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N=8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (Kings College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs) measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines. Components of variance and intra-class correlations were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. Results: Intra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. First considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, but there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data. Conclusion: These results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonization of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3-month prospective analytical interventional study sampled 85 undergraduate students from the Department of Preventive Dental Sciences. A WhatsApp group was created, information was sent to the male and female groups, and a written assignment was used as a performance benchmark of knowledge acquisition and application. Perceptions of e-learning through WhatsApp were assessed using a previously validated and published questionnaire. Collected data underwent descriptive and bivariate analyses (unpaired t-test). RESULTS: The average assignment scores of the 85 hybrid learners were statistically significantly higher than those of traditional learners from the previous academic year (34 +/- 1 vs 26 +/- 3;p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, 57 hybrid learners completed the survey, and 73% agreed/strongly agreed that introducing a new method of teaching via WhatsApp was useful, 70% reported that a professional and comfortable learning environment was created, and 70% felt that group distractions were handled appropriately. The top advantages of learning through WhatsApp were availability/immediacy (94.7%) and being simple to operate (91.2%). Males (40.4%) were significantly more likely to report a sense of belonging to the group than females (33.3%, p = 0.01). Respondents agreed that high expectations of teacher availability (71.9%) and some students making no effort (52.6%) were challenges. Message flooding (45.6%) and time-consuming nature of WhatsApp (36.8%) were identified as technical challenges.

Voluntary participants responded to questionnaires about their relationship with dogs, dog attachment, and dog walking during COVID-19. Our study suggests that dog walking has no direct effect on reducing loneliness but the relationship between dog walking and loneliness might be mediated by attachment. Due to the strict social distancing guidelines during the pandemic, dog walking would not allow opportunities for conversation with other people, but it seems that spending time outside with dogs strengthens the bonds between humans and companion dogs, alleviating loneliness. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed peoples lives and increased their vulnerability to physical and mental health hazards. While Korea has avoided nationwide lockdown measures since the COVID-19 outbreak, the prolonged restrictions and social isolation measures have resulted in detrimental psychological effects, such as increased anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. The present study investigated dog attachment and changes in dog walking during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of dog attachment and dog walking on the loneliness of Korean dog owners. An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in the fall of 2021 in which 249 dog owners responded to questionnaires that asked questions about dog attachment, their perception of dog walking, and their feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most dog owners responded that they spent more time with their dogs and developed a stronger bond with them during the pandemic. Additionally, respondents stated that they walked their dogs more often than they did before COVID-19 and that their dogs aided in reducing loneliness. We found that dog walking directly affected attachment and indirectly influenced the loneliness of dog owners. Further research is required to determine how dog walking impacts positive psychological effects and promote dog walking.","output":"Influences of Dog Attachment and Dog Walking on Reducing Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of late toward the finish of 2019, another illness was found in Wuhan, China.

Our objective is to assess patients' self-reported impact of healthcare lockdown measures on their fears and anxieties during the crisis period of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: We conducted a digital, self-reported, patient care survey distributed by electronic mail (e-mail) at Columbia University's department of ophthalmology outpatient faculty practice. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of either retinal disease or glaucoma and a cancelled or rescheduled ophthalmology established patient appointment during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients without an e-mail address listed in their electronic medical record were excluded. The survey occurred between March 2, 2020 to May 30, 2o2o. Primary measures were survey responses to assess key areas of patient anxiety or concern during the pandemic including safety of care delivery in a COVID pandemic, difficulties contacting or being seen by their ophthalmologist, concern of vision loss or disease progression, and concern over missed or access to treatments. Secondary measures were correlating survey response to factors such as: visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), diagnosis, disease severity, follow up urgency, recent treatments and diagnostic testing data. RESULTS: Of the 2,594 surveys sent out, 510 (19.66%) were completed. Over 95% of patients were at least as concerned as in normal circumstances about their ocular health during the peak of the pandemic. 76% of respondents were more concerned than normal that they could not be seen by their ophthalmologist soon enough. Increased concern over ocular health, disease progression and access to care all showed positive correlations (P<0.05) with worse disease severity as measured with testing such as visual fields and optical coherence tomography. Additionally, 55% of patients were afraid of contracting COVID-19 during an office visit. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We found a majority of our patients were concerned about limitations in access to ophthalmic care and were fearful of disease progression. Additionally, we found a number of demographic and clinical factors that correlated with increased anxiety in our patients.","output":"Patient Concerns Regarding Suspended Ophthalmic Care Due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study applied the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) in political crisis communication amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, a sticky crisis that is longitudinal and politicized, thereby involving multiple challenges and complexities. Considering the critical role of Twitter in the information transmissions during the ongoing pandemic, this study considered politicians tweets as a proxy to access their crisis communication strategies and conducted a systematic content analysis to critically evaluate COVID-19 crisis communication strategies of two politicians, Trump and Cuomo, according to their perceived day-to-day circumstances during COVID-19. Three strategies categorized by SCCT, deny, diminish, and bolstering, surfaced with significance for both Trump and Cuomo. A new strategy specific to the political context, cohesion, was also identified. In addition, significant differentiation was observed in the strategic narratives between Trump and Cuomo, which reveals the evolving political dynamics in disease representation and crisis messaging. For example, Trump emphasized social exclusion and accusations of Democrats whilst Cuomo stressed care for vulnerable and minority groups and compassion delivery. Moreover, deny strategy, especially accusing other races, significantly boosted audience engagement for Trump. The results are discussed in relation to the idiosyncrasy of the complex COVID-19 pandemic and crisis communication in the political realm. Our findings demonstrate practical implications including online crisis messaging recommendations that foster public trust during politicized and polarized health emergencies and cultivate grounds for information exchange beyond partisan barriers.","output":"Deny or Bolster?

The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.","output":"Antibody-dependent NK cell degranulation as a marker for assessing antibody-dependent cytotoxicity against pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in human plasma and influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though we have a general understanding of the brain areas involved in motor sequence learning, there is more to discover about the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition. Skill acquisition may be subserved, in part, by interactions between the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex through a cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal network. In prior work, we investigated this network by targeting the cerebellum; here, we explored the consequence of stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) before administering an explicit motor sequence learning paradigm. Using a mixed within- and between- subjects design, we employed anodal (n = 24) and cathodal (n = 25) HD-tDCS (relative to sham) to temporarily alter brain function and examine effects on skill acquisition. The results indicate that both anodal and cathodal prefrontal stimulation impedes motor sequence learning, relative to sham. These findings suggest an overall negative influence of active prefrontal stimulation on the acquisition of a sequential pattern of finger movements. Collectively, this provides novel insight on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in initial skill acquisition, when cognitive processes such as working memory are used. Exploring methods that may improve motor learning is important in developing therapeutic strategies for motor-related diseases and rehabilitation.","output":"Using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation to investigate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in explicit sequence learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are limited tools for adapting COVID-19 infection control plans to school settings.

The adapted infection control pillars model utilizes implementation-science informed considerations to maximize pragmatism and adherence by leveraging evidence-based strategies. It highlights the necessity of redundant infection prevention interventions, acknowledges the importance of community buy-in to achieve real-world effectiveness, and addresses tactics to overcome implementation barriers.

We construct a novel infectious disease model incorporating these distinct quarantine measures (contact tracing and self-quarantine) as reactionary interventions dependent on current infection levels. Derivation of the final outbreak size leads to a simple inverse proportionality relationship with self-quarantine rate, revealing a fundamental principle of exponentially increasing cumulative cases when delaying mass quarantine or lockdown measures beyond a critical time period. In contrast, contact tracing results in a proportional reduction in reproduction number, flattening the epidemic curve but only having sizable impact on final size when a large proportion of contacts are \\"perfectly\\" traced. We fit the mathematical model to data from China on reported cases and quarantined contacts, finding that lockdowns had an overwhelming influence on outbreak size and duration, whereas contact tracing played a role in reducing peak number of infected.

In two studies conducted in the USA (N=160) and UK (N=161), at different times during the pandemic, we show that participants considered the likelihood of contracting and carrying the infection lower for themselves and their close other compared to an acquaintance, while they considered the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviours higher for themselves and their close other than an acquaintance. The findings document unrealistic optimism in relation to COVID-19.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord showed the focal lesion in the C2-T1 segments, which was consistent with the features of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Along with the myelitis, acute motor axonal polyneuropathy was diagnosed. This diagnosis of GBS was supported by ascending weakness with areflexia, albumin-cytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid and the data of neuroelectrophysiological examination. We proposed that both myelitis and GBS had disimmune nature associated with COVID-19. The other possible causes of damage to the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system were excluded.

The metric depends on the expected mortality level, which can differ based on given choices, such as the method and the time series length used to estimate the baseline. However, these choices are often arbitrary, and are not subject to any sensitivity analysis. We bring to light the importance of carefully choosing the inputs and methods used to estimate excess mortality. Drawing on data from 26 countries, we investigate how sensitive excess mortality is to the choice of the mortality index, the number of years included in the reference period, the method, and the time unit of the death series. We employ two mortality indices, three reference periods, two data time units, and four methods for estimating the baseline. We show that excess mortality estimates can vary substantially when these factors are changed, and that the largest variations stem from the choice of the mortality index and the method. We also find that the magnitude of the variation in excess mortality can change markedly within countries, resulting in different cross-country rankings.

Palm oils are key dietary components consumed daily by over three billion people, mostly in Asia, and also have a wide range of important non-food uses including in cleansing and sanitizing products. MAIN BODY: Oil palm is a perennial crop with a > 25-year life cycle and an exceptionally low land footprint compared to annual oilseed crops. Oil palm crops globally produce an annual 81 million tonnes (Mt) of oil from about 19 million hectares (Mha). In contrast, the second and third largest vegetable oil crops, soybean and rapeseed, yield a combined 84 Mt oil but occupy over 163 Mha of increasingly scarce arable land. The oil palm crop system faces many challenges in the 2020s. These include increasing incidence of new and existing pests/diseases and a general lack of climatic resilience, especially relating to elevated temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, plus downstream issues relating to supply chains and consumer sentiment. This review surveys the oil palm sector in the 2020s and beyond, its major challenges and options for future progress. CONCLUSIONS: Oil palm crop production faces many future challenges, including emerging threats from climate change and pests and diseases. The inevitability of climate change requires more effective international collaboration for its reduction. New breeding and management approaches are providing the promise of improvements, such as much higher yielding varieties, improved oil profiles, enhanced disease resistance, and greater climatic resilience.","output":"Oil palm in the 2020s and beyond: challenges and solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moderna's vaccine trial is the third in a week to release positive results, raising hopes for a choice of vaccines, reports Michael Le Page","output":"Vaccine trial hat-trick"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African swine fever is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), and has a mortality rate approaching 100%.

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used.

Moreover, the deep and pervasive history of medical racism in the U.S. has created a context in which some racial and ethnic groups exhibit greater levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; yet few researchers have attempted to determine whether these patterns persist with time. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a.) assess the role of time in COVID-19 vaccine intentions from April 2020 to January 2021, and (b.) examine whether race and ethnicity shape COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories. Data were drawn from 9 waves of the Understanding America Study (na?=a?5023), a national probability panel study of U.S. adults. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess overall COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories and trajectories by race and ethnicity. Results demonstrate intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine significantly decreased from April 2020 to November 2020, but by January 2021, intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine slightly increased. Findings also show trajectories significantly differed by racial and ethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest probability of likely getting a COVID-19 vaccine at baseline, followed by Whites and Latina/os. Black Americans exhibited the lowest probability of likely getting vaccinated, and, in most cases, the gap between Black Americans and other racial groups grew over time. Key findings from this study demonstrate that, among U.S. adults, time and race and ethnicity play significant roles in COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Understanding the role of time and race and racism in shaping COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories can help government agencies and public health experts tasked with administrating vaccines better understand disparities in vaccine uptake.","output":"Trajectories of COVID-19 vaccine intentions among U.S. adults: The role of race and ethnicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Read about how a son, who's also a nurse, cared for his mother after she was infected with COVID-19 and the universal lessons they learned.","output":"A nurse is a gift to older parents with COVID-19: One nurse's story"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess whether physically active yoga is superior to waitlist control, treatment as usual and attention control in alleviating depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosed mental disorder recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

Within PHIRI (Population Health Information Research Infrastructure) the best available evidence for research on health and well-being of populations as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic is generated and facilitated by a research infrastructure on population health. It supports research across Europe through the identification, access, assessment and reuse of population health and non-health data to underpin public health policy decisions. PHIRI lays the foundation for ultimately developing a distributed infrastructure on population health (DIPoH). In order to foster population health research on COVID-19, the access to and use of COVID-19 relevant population health information and health data should be facilitated, together with services and tools necessary for researchers to link different data sources and to use Pan-European data in a GDPR compliant, federated way. Furthermore, to tackle health information inequalities, capacity building is of eminent importance. Finally, a way to facilitate swift responses to research and policy questions that are raised in countries is needed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. In this workshop, the tools and approaches gained within PHIRI are presented and showcased. The workshop will begin with a short presentation on the purpose of this research infrastructure and the prospective distributed infrastructure on population health. This will be followed by four presentations that highlight key activities in PHIRI: The first presentation showcases the Health Information Portal, the one-stop-shop facilitating access to data sources, population health studies, training material and courses, considering ethical and legal aspects. The second presentation shows the technological substrate for the development of a federated research infrastructure. The third presentation demonstrates the European School on Health Information, that aims to contribute to increasing knowledge on availability and use of standardized Health Information methods to common practices in EU countries. The final presentation informs on the Rapid Exchange Forum, establishing a sustainable infrastructure to support rapid exchange between actors from competent authorities, their advisors, researchers and stakeholders in the joint efforts to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge and expertise developed across Europe is shared in this workshop, supporting countries to address the COVID-19 crisis now and in its aftermath. Exchange with the audience will facilitate knowledge and opinion exchange through an interactive voting poll during the session. A poll will offer the delegates to share, in real time, their perspectives on selected questions based on the four presentations. KEY MESSAGES: This workshop will leverage the tools and methodologies that are developed in PHIRI to foster population health research across Europe to underpin public health policy decisions. The support of exchange of knowledge and expertise across Europe is key, and facilitated by capacity building on data management and research methodologies; and the rapid exchange of urgent questions.","output":"6.B.

However, it remains unclear the extent to which observed discriminative performance is attributable to behavioral change after receiving test results. We conducted a retrospective study in a sample of medical interns who received COVID-19 test results from March to December 2020. Our data confirmed that sensor data were able to differentiate between symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with good accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75). However, removing post-result data substantially reduced discriminative capacity (0.75 to 0.63; delta= ?0.12, p=0.013). Removing data in the symptomatic period prior to receipt of test results did not produce similar reductions in discriminative capacity. These findings suggest a meaningful proportion of the discriminative capacity of wearable sensor data for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to behavior change after receiving test results.","output":"A Caveat to Using Wearable Sensor Data for COVID-19 Detection: The Role of Behavioral Change after Receipt of Test Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to prepare the government and citizens of India to take or implement the control measures proactively to reduce the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD: In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. RESULTS: The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further.

Objective: To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Data Sources: Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Study Selection: Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. Results: A total of 10a?930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

This dysfunction is thought to underlie neuroimaging abnormalities commonly found in patients with psychosis, particularly in the hippocampus. These include increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and levels of glutamatergic metabolites, and decreases in binding of GABAA 5 receptors and the synaptic density marker synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). However, direct links between PV+ interneuron dysfunction and these neuroimaging readouts have yet to be established. Conditional deletion of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, the tyrosine kinase receptor Erbb4, from cortical and hippocampal PV+ interneurons leads to several synaptic, behavioral and cognitive phenotypes relevant to psychosis in mice. Here, we investigated how this PV+ interneuron disruption affects the hippocampal in vivo neuroimaging readouts in the Erbb4 model. Adult Erbb4 conditional mutant mice (Lhx6-Cre;Erbb4F/F, n=12) and their wild-type littermates (Erbb4F/F, n=12) were scanned in a 9.4T magnetic resonance scanner to quantify CBF and glutamatergic metabolite levels (glutamine, glutamate, GABA).

Erbb4 mutant mice showed significantly elevated CBF and glutamine levels, as well as decreased SV2A density compared to wild-type littermates. No significant GABAA receptor density differences were identified.

Strategies involving antibody testing have been proposed before phased reopening of the economy. Therefore, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients remains paramount to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 detect the presence of IgA, IgM, or IgG antibodies produced by B cells. There are four major types of antibody tests: rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, neutralization assays, and chemiluminescent immunoassays. Currently, there is no standard antibody test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during or after exposure or infection. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have a low specificity within the first week of exposure and increase in the second and third weeks.

The timing and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic response and control varied among the regions and from one country to the other, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. The focus of this work is on the early phase of the disease when control measures can be most effective. We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). It was found that in the early phase of COVID-19 spread the disease follows a certain empirical law that is common in all regions considered. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. These rates responded quickly to the launch of the 1(st)-level Response to Major Public Health Emergency in each region, peaking after 1C2 days, reaching their inflection points after 10C19 days, and dropping to zero after 11C18 days since the 1(st)-level response was launched. By March 29(th), the mortality rates were 0.08% (Zhejiang), 0.54% (Guangdong) and 3.95% (Xinjiang). Subsequent modeling simulations were based on the working assumption that similar infection transmission control measures were taken in South Korea as in Zhejiang on February 25(th), in Italy as in Guangdong on February 25(th), and in Iran as in Xinjiang on March 8(th). The results showed that by June 15(th) the accumulated infection cases could have been reduced by 32.49% (South Korea), 98.16% (Italy) and 85.73% (Iran). The surface air temperature showed stronger association with transmission rate of COVID-19 than surface relative humidity. On the basis of these findings, disease control measures were shown to be particularly effective in flattening and shrinking the COVID-10 case curve, which could effectively reduce the severity of the disease and mitigate medical burden.

Many challenges identified were systemic in nature: lack of culturally relevant resources; staffing that does not represent participants' cultures/language; eligibility criteria that disproportionately excludes Hispanics/Latinos; and too few studies available in Hispanic/Latino communities. The paper also details facilitators and messaging strategies to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research, starting with approaches that recognize and address the heterogeneity of the Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and then, tailor outreach activities and programs to address their diverse needs and circumstances. The needs identified in this article represent longstanding failures to improve engagement and interest among Hispanics/Latinos in AD/ADRD research; we discuss how the field can move forward learning from the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Facilitators, Challenges, and Messaging Strategies for Hispanic/Latino Populations Participating in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Clinical Research: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The causative agent for the most fatal form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, has developed insecticide and drug resistance with time. Therefore combating this disease is becoming increasingly difficult and this calls for finding alternate ways to control malaria. One of the feasible ways could be to find out inhibitors/drugs specific for the indispensable enzymes of malaria parasite such as helicases. These helicases, which contain intrinsic nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity, are capable of enzymatically unwinding energetically stable duplex nucleic acids into single-stranded templates and are required for all the nucleic acid transactions. Most of the helicases contain a set of nine extremely conserved amino acid sequences, which are called helicase motifs. Due to the presence of the DEAD (AspCGluCAlaCAsp) in one of the conserved motifs, this family is also known as the DEAD-box family. In this review, using bioinformatic approach, we describe the DEAD-box helicases of malaria parasite P. falciparum. An in depth analysis shows that the parasite contains 22 full-length genes, some of which are homologues of well-characterized helicases of this family from other organisms. Recently we have cloned and characterized the first member of this family, which is a homologue of p68 and is expressed during the schizont stage of the development of the parasite [Pradhan, A., Chauhan, V.S., Tuteja, R., 2005a. A novel DEAD-box DNA helicase from Plasmodium falciparum is homologous to p68. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 140, 55C60.; Pradhan A., Chauhan V.S., Tuteja R., 2005b. Plasmodium falciparum DNA helicase 60 is a schizont stage specific, bipolar and dual helicase stimulated by PKC phosphorylation. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 144, 133C141.]. It will be really interesting to clone and characterize other members of the DEAD-box family and understand their role in the replication and transmission of the parasite. These detailed studies may help to identify a parasite-specific enzyme, which could be a potential drug target to treat malaria. The various steps at which this probable drug can act are also discussed.","output":"Unraveling the DEAD-box helicases of Plasmodium falciparum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Recent national events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and protests of racial inequities, have drawn attention to the role of physicians in advocating for improvements in the social, economic, and political factors that affect health. Characterizing the current state of advocacy training in U.S. medical schools may help set expectations for physician advocacy and predict future curricular needs. METHOD: Using the members school directory provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the authors compiled a list of 154 MD-granting medical schools in the United States in 2019-2020. They used multiple search strategies to identify online course catalogues and advocacy-related curricula using variations of the terms \\"advocacy,\\" \\"policy,\\" \\"equity,\\" and \\"social determinants of health.\\" They used an iterative process to generate a preliminary coding schema and to code all course descriptions, conducting content analysis to describe the structure of courses and topics covered. RESULTS: Of 134 medical schools with any online course catalogue available, 103 (76.9%) offered at least one advocacy course. Required courses were typically survey courses focused on general content in health policy, population health, or public health/epidemiology, whereas elective courses were more likely to focus specifically on advocacy skills building and to feature field experiences. Of 352 advocacy-specific courses, 93 (26.4%) concentrated on a specific population (e.g., children or persons with low socioeconomic status). Few courses (n = 8) focused on racial/ethnic minorities and racial inequities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that while most U.S. medical schools offer at least one advocacy course, the majority are elective rather than required, and the structure and content of advocacy-related courses vary substantially. Given the urgency to address social, economic, and political factors affecting health and health equity, this study provides an important and timely overview of the prevalence and content of advocacy curricula at U.S. medical schools.","output":"Prevalence and Characteristics of Advocacy Curricula in U.S. Medical Schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the pathogen of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has posed a serious threat to global public health.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of endotracheal intubation, the effectiveness of treatment, complications and mortality in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in a first-level hospital in Madrid. Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit with tachypnea, use of accessory musculature or Sp(O2) <92% despite Fi(O2)> 0.5 were included. Intubation rate, medical complications, and 28-day mortality were recorded. Statistical analysis through association studies, logistic and Cox regression models and survival analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included. 37.1% required endotracheal intubation, 58.6% suffered medical complications and 24.3% died. Prone positioning was independently associated with lower need for endotracheal intubation (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.005 to 0.54, p = 0.001).

The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is a multifaceted communication intervention that builds capacity for clinicians to have earlier, more frequent, and more person-centered conversations. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinicians experiences with the SICP 1 year after implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Canada. The SICP was implemented at Hamilton General Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario) from March 1, 2017, to January 19, 2018, and at Foothills Medical Centre (Calgary, Alberta) from March 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. A total of 45 clinicians were invited to participate in the study, and 23 clinicians (51.1%) were enrolled and interviewed. Semistructured interviews of clinicians were conducted between August 2018 and May 2019. Content analysis was used to evaluate information obtained from these interviews between May 2019 and May 2020. EXPOSURES: The SICP includes clinician training, communication tools, and processes for system change. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinicians experiences with and perceptions of the SICP. RESULTS: Among 23 clinicians interviewed, 15 (65.2%) were women. The mean (SD) number of years in practice was 14.6 (9.1) at the Hamilton site and 12.0 (6.9) at the Calgary site. Participants included 19 general internists, 3 nurse practitioners, and 1 social worker. The 3 main themes were the ways in which the SICP (1) supported changes in clinician behavior, (2) shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status, and (3) influenced clinicians personally and professionally. Changes in clinician behavior were supported by having a unit champion, interprofessional engagement, access to copies of the Serious Illness Conversation Guide, and documentation in the electronic medical record. Elements of the program, especially the Serious Illness Conversation Guide, shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status and influenced clinicians on personal and professional levels. Concerns with the program included finding time to have conversations, building transient relationships, and limiting conversation fluidity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, hospital clinicians described components of the SICP as supporting changes in their behavior and facilitating meaningful patient interactions that shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status. The perceived benefits of SICP implementation stimulated uptake within the medical units. These findings suggest that the SICP may prompt hospital culture changes in goals-of-care dialogue with patients and the care of hospitalized patients with serious illness.","output":"Clinicians Perspectives After Implementation of the Serious Illness Care Program: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the role of midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) in patients with COVID-19.

Logistic regression was employed to identify characteristics associated with close adherence to preventive behavior practices in 2020. Results About 70.2% of participants adhered closely to recommended preventive behavior practices. Compared with 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1, there was a significant increase in the use of facemasks during pdmCOVID-19 (66.6% vs. 99.2% [indoors], p < 0.001) and the use of on-person alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHS) (44.2% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001) or 98.4% (hand sanitation at entry of buildings, p < 0.001) during the pdmCOVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression revealed four characteristics significantly associated with continuance of close adherence to recommend preventive behavior practices in 2020: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.72), receipt of government COVID-19-prevention information (aOR, 1.52), recruitment of the study subjects from primary care clinics (aOR, 1.43), and previous use of AHS during the 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1 (AOR, 1.37).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from breast or CRPC, who were going to start or were already receiving BTAs, were randomised to 4- or 12-weekly BTA treatment for 2 years. The endpoints were: symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) rates, time to SSEs, toxicity and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Of 263 patients (160 breast cancer, 103 CRPC), 133 (50.6%) and 130 (49.4%) were randomised to the 4- and 12-weekly groups, respectively. BTAs included denosumab (56.3%), zoledronate (24.0%) and pamidronate (19.8%). After 2 years, the cumulative incidence rate (95% CI) of SSEs was 32.7% (24.6% to 41.1%) and 28.1% (20.3% to 36.4%) for the 4- and 12-weekly intervention groups respectively. The hazard ratio for time to first SSE was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.63 to 1.47). However, in a post hoc analysis, those patients who had an on-study SSE, there was a small non-statistical increased risk of subsequent SSEs among patients on the 12-weekly dosing arm (HR = 1.14; 95% CI C 0.90C1.44). BTA-related toxicity rates were similar between study arms. A cost-utility analysis showed that 12-weekly BTA is cost-effective from a public payers perspective. CONCLUSION: These results in addition to those previously reported for de-escalating zoledronate, would support that de-escalation of commonly used BTAs is a reasonable and economically valid treatment option. While not statistically significant, the increase in subsequent SSEs in the 12-weekly arm requires further exploration.","output":"Two-year results of a randomised trial comparing 4- versus 12-weekly bone-targeted agent use in patients with bone metastases from breast or castration-resistant prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteases are ubiquitous in biosystems where they have diverse roles in the biochemical, physiological, and regulatory aspects of cells and organisms. Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability, have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5C1.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9C10. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10C11) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillusclausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.","output":"Proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This pilot study was designed to assess bowel function and quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents with congenital colorectal malformations (CCM) during the first UK COVID lockdown period.

An increase in clinical studies has reported the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). For example, intravenous Chinese medicine can significantly improve cardiac function and biomarkers in patients with CHF. However, there exists inconsistency, lack of practicality and unclear reporting of outcomes in these clinical trials causing difficulty in the comparison of results across similar studies during data synthesis. A core outcome set (COS) can help in the standardisation of outcomes reported across studies from the same healthcare area. The aim of this study is to develop a COS on TCM for CHF (COS-TCM-CHF) to reduce heterogeneity in reporting and improve quality assessment in clinical trials to support data synthesis in addressing the effectiveness of TCM treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will include constructing an outcome pool which will identify potential outcomes through systematic reviews of TCM randomised clinical trials, two clinical registry databases, semi-structured interviews of patients and the clinicians questionnaire. According to the characteristics of TCM and a taxonomy recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative, all outcomes in the outcome pool will be classified into different domains. A preliminary list of outcomes which will then be used in the Delphi survey is generated using a certain criteria based on the length of the pool. The Delphi survey will include two rounds with seven key stakeholder groups to select candidate items for a consensus meeting.

SETTING: An online sexual health service available free of charge in South East London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Routinely collected data from 237 users of the pilot service during the study period and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 15 users. INTERVENTION: A pilot, free, online photodiagnosis service for genital herpes and warts with postal treatment delivered by a specialist digital sexual health service. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of users who successfully uploaded photographs and the proportion diagnosed, treated and referred to face-to-face clinical services. User experience of this service. RESULTS: The service was accessed by 237 users during the study period with assessment possible for 86% of users based on the photographs provided. A diagnosis of genital herpes or warts was made for 40.5% and 89.6% were subsequently treated through the service. Eighteen per cent were diagnosed as normal/not needing treatment and 42% were signposted to clinic for further clinical assessment. Qualitative data showed that users felt able and willing to provide genital images for diagnosis. Those who were treated or reassured expressed high satisfaction with the service, valuing the convenience, discreetness and support provided. However, users, particularly those who required referral to other services requested more personal and detailed communication when a clinical diagnosis is given remotely. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that online photodiagnosis was feasible and acceptable. However, effective and acceptable management of those who require referral needs careful remote communication.","output":"Photodiagnosis of genital herpes and warts within a specialist online sexual health service: an observational (mixed methods) study of user experience and clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) has gained popularity for the treatment of refractory respiratory failure during and after the 2009 influenza pandemic, and still represents a precious therapeutic resource for severe novel coronavirus 2019 infection. However, most of the published studies are small case series, and only two randomized trials exist in literature. AIM Aim of this systematic review is to describe trends in VV ECMO treatment outcomes according to large studies only. METHODS We searched and included studies with more than 100 VV ECMO cases dated up to August 1st, 2019. RESULTS Thirty-three studies published in the period 2011-2019 met inclusion criteria, for a total of 12,860 patients (age 46.3  17.4 years). ARDS was mainly by pneumonia, in 3126 (37%) cases; further 401(7%) patients had H1N1 Influenza A infection. Cannulation-related complications occurred in 502 (7%) cases. Weighted mean (95% confidence interval) of VV ECMO duration was 8.9 (8.7-9.1) days, and ICU stay was 23.6 (22.4-24.8) days. Mortality at the longest follow up available was 40%.

Our current study aimed to identify specific COVID-19 (18)F-FDG-PET signs in patients that were (i) suspected to have a lung infection based on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT recorded during the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) whose COVID-19 diagnosis was definitely established or excluded by appropriate viral testing. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients referred for routine (18)F-FDG-PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 outbreak (March 25th to May 15th 2020) and for whom CT slices were evocative of a lung infection were included in the study. All patients had undergone a SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19 infection (positivity was based on molecular and/or serological tests) or exclude it (negativity of at least the serological test). RESULTS: Eleven patients were confirmed to be affected by COVID-19 (COVID+), whereas the other eleven patients were not (COVID?) and were predominantly suspected of having bacterial pneumonia. CT abnormalities were not significantly different between COVID+ and COVID? groups, although trends toward larger CT abnormalities (p = 0.16) and lower rates of consolidation patterns (0.09) were observed in the COVID+ group. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) of lung areas with CT abnormalities were however significantly lower in the COVID+ than the COVID? group (3.7  1.9 vs. 6.9  4.1, p = 0.03), with the highest SUV(max) consistently not associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Among CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection, those related to COVID-19 are associated with a more limited (18)F-FDG uptake. This observation may help improve our ability to detect COVID-19 patients.

However, there is limited research work available to assess their beneficial effects. MATERIAL: We conducted retrospective study comparing remdesivir and baricitinib-remdesivir combination therapy in hospitalized adults with moderate to severe Covid-19. All the patients received remdesivir for 5 days and one subgroup had received baricitinib (14 days) along with remdesivir. The decision to administer remdesivir only or remdesivir along with baricitinib was the treating clinician's discretion. The primary outcome was to assess the 28-day mortality. OBSERVATION: A total of 50 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia had received either remdesivir alone or both remdesivir and baricinitib during the duration of 1st April 2021 to 30th June 2021in our hospital. The 28-day mortality was 9.091% in the combination group and 14.29% in the remdesivir only group (risk difference= -5.195%, risk ratio for death=0.3634; 95% CI, 0.1281, 3.161; p=0. 0.3086). Patients who had a FiO2 requirement of 100% at any point of time had 100% mortality, irrespective of the drug received.

Arts graduates play important roles in an economy, through both artistic creation and in careers outside of the arts. While the Great Recession took a significant toll on the US economy generally, arts majors faced additional vulnerabilities as industries that rely on discretionary spending, like the arts and entertainment, are especially hard hit in times of economic downturn. This paper assesses the impact of graduating during or shortly after the recession relative to graduating shortly before this period on educational choices, including choice of major, double majoring, and completing an advanced degree, and career outcomes, including employment status, type of employment, hours worked, and earnings, for college graduates majoring in the arts. Graduating before or after the recession is found to have a negative impact on the share of graduates majoring in traditional arts fields, but a positive impact on the share majoring in related creative fields. Using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, relative to non-art college graduates, traditional arts majors graduating during or after the Great Recession are more likely to complete a double major, be self-employed, be unemployed, work longer hours, and earn less income than those graduating prior to the recession. These impacts are likely to have a negative effect on the pipeline of college-educated artists working in the arts into the future.","output":"Arts majors and the Great Recession: a cross-sectional analysis of educational choices and employment outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease with no proven pharmaceutical intervention and no proven vaccine. In such circumstances, prevention is all we have. The role of handwashing in the prevention of communicable diseases has been known for over a century, yet it remains severely neglected as a public health investment, to be periodically re-discovered during pandemic-scale infections. Over 26% of the global population has no access to a handwashing station in the home; for many low-income countries this proportion rises to over 50%. In other instances, the water is unaffordable or the supply has been shut off on account of unpaid bills. But when there is no water in the home or yard, or no mechanism for delivering enough water, good hand-washing is extremely difficult. Well before COVID-19, global cost-benefit analyses of water and sanitation investments, with benefits measured in time-savings as well as health, showed significant net benefits in all sub-regions of the developing world. This Viewpoint paper argues that, in the current crisis and its aftermath, it is imperative for governments and donors to prioritize and generously fund affordable, reliable, and accessible water services in underserved regions of the world.

There is currently no data on the process of transitioning patients established on intravenous (IV) to SC as part of routine clinical care. The aim of this programme is to evaluate the clinical and biochemical outcomes of switching a cohort of IBD patients established on IV vedolizumab to SC 12 weeks following the transition. METHODS 178 adult patients were offered the opportunity to transition to SC vedolizumab. Patients who agreed were reviewed prior to switching and at week 12 (W12) after their first SC dose. Evaluation outcomes included disease activity scores, the IBD-Control patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and faecal calprotectin (FCP). Reasons for patients declining or accepting transitioning, pharmacokinetics, adverse drug reactions and risk factors for a poor outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection were also assessed. RESULTS 124 patients agreed to transition, of which 106 patients had been on IV vedolizumab for at least 4 months. There were no statistically significant differences in disease activity scores or IBD-Control PROMs between baseline and W12. A statistically significant increase in FCP was observed (31g/g vs. 47g/g; p=0.008), although this was unlikely to be clinically relevant. The most common adverse drug reaction reported was injection site reactions (15%). Based on this cohort of patients, an expected reduction of 572,000 per annum is likely to be achieved.

Based on the dual-factor model of mental health, which postulates positive and negative dimensions, we assessed the influence of COVID-19 fear on both negative and positive mental health outcomes and examined the mediational role of coping strategies. (2) Methods: A convenience sample of 231 respondents participated in an online survey reporting on measures of pandemic fear (SFS), distress (HADS), post-traumatic growth (PTGI) and individual differences in terms of coping strategies (CSI-SF). (3) Results: Respondents main concerns related with the pandemic highlighted the interpersonal and social dimensions implicated in fear of COVID-19. As expected, fear of the pandemic was associated not just with negative but also positive outcomes, while different coping strategies played a role in determining such effects. More specifically, disengagement coping mediated the effects of fear on anxiety and depression, whereas engagement coping was the only mediator of the relationship between COVID-19 fear and post-traumatic growth.

Findings revealed that fuel subsidy removal inversely relates to Nigeria's carbon emission in the short run and long run. The study recommends a complementary policy option that ensures additional financial savings to the government should be invested in public sector growth that can cushion the effect of relative income loss to the citizenry.

Cholecystostomy performed during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected a shift toward non-surgical treatment of cholecystitis and increased number of critically ill patients suffering from acalculous cholecystitis. PURPOSE: (1) To determine demographic, clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound features associated with cholecystostomy placement during hospitalization for COVID-19. (2) To develop multivariable logistic regression modeling for likelihood of biliary intervention. METHODS: This retrospective review received institutional review board approval. Informed consent was waived. Between March 2020 and June 2020, patients with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP)/Weill Cornell Medical Center, NYP/Lower Manhattan Hospital, and NYP/Queens were evaluated for inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were (1) patient age  18, (2) confirmed COVID-19 infection by polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal swab, and (3) abdominal ultrasound performed during hospitalization. Exclusion criteria were (1) history of cholecystectomy and (2) biliary intervention performed prior to abdominal ultrasound. Patients were stratified into two groups based on whether they received cholecystostomy during hospitalization. Differences in demographics, medical history, clinical status, medications, laboratory values, and ultrasound findings between the two groups were evaluated using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test for categorical variables and t test or Wilcoxon-rank sum test for continuous variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model likelihood of biliary intervention. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent cholecystostomy placement and formed the Intervention Group. 203 patients formed the No Intervention Group. Liver size and diuretics use during hospitalization were the only variables which were significantly different between the two groups, with p-values of 0.02 and 0.046, respectively. After controlling for diuretics use, the odds of receiving cholecystostomy increased by 30% with every centimeter increase in liver size (p = 0.03).

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of leprosy in Brazil during the year 2020. METHODS: We evaluated the monthly incidence of leprosy and calculated the percentage change to verify whether there was an increase or decrease in the number of leprosy cases in 2020, considering the monthly average of cases over the previous 5 years. We used interrupted time series analysis to assess the trend in the diagnosis of leprosy before and after the start of COVID-19 in Brazil and prepared spatial distribution maps, considering the percentage variation in each state. FINDINGS: We verified a reduction of 41.4% of leprosy cases in Brazil in 2020. Likewise, there was a reduction of leprosy notifications in children under 15 years-old (-56.82%). Conversely, the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy increased (8.1%). There was a decreasing trend in the leprosy incidence in the general population between 2015 and 2020 in Brazil. Spatial distribution maps depicted a reduction of up to 100% in new cases of leprosy in some states. INTERPRETATION: Along with COVID-19 spread there was a reduction in leprosy diagnosis in the general population and children under 15 years-old, and also an increase in multibacillary cases diagnosed, signalling a serious impact of the pandemic on leprosy control strategies in Brazil.

RESULTS The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655 - 2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609 - 531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (n=104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [p=0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404-6.486)]. CONCLUSION Health professionals should be aware if their patients concomitantly use medicinal plants and psychiatric drugs. Public health campaigns should promote the possible adverse reactions that might produce the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations for mental illnesses.","output":"Self-treatment and adverse reactions with herbal products for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression in adults from the central-western region of Mexico during the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of 2020, varied presentations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported. The present report is of a case of hyponatremia and encephalopathy due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) as the main presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 55-year-old woman. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus presented with confusion and slurring of speech, with a temperature of 38.5C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 159/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She did not have edema on examination. Laboratory testing showed a low sodium level of 116 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L) with urine osmolarity of 364 mOsm/kg, urinary sodium of 69 mEq/L, urinary potassium of 15.6 mEq/L, and serum osmolarity of 251 mOsm/kg. The patient had normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels. A chest X-ray should no pulmonary infiltrates nor did a lumbar puncture reveal signs of infection. A real-time SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for COVID-19. Brain imaging with computed tomography was negative for acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, and mass effect. Based on findings from laboratory testing and physical examination, a diagnosis of SIADH was made. The patient was treated with 3% hypertonic saline, followed by salt tablets and fluid restriction, with improvement in her clinical symptoms and serum sodium level. CONCLUSIONS The present report is of a rare but previously reported association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encephalopathy and hyponatremia associated with SIADH without pneumonia or other symptoms of infection should be an indication for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Hyponatremia and Encephalopathy in a 55-Year-old Woman with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion as an Isolated Presentation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes how a national nursing association and a major academic medical center responded to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic during the first wave of the outbreak in the United States (January to August 2020).

This paper focuses on using Blockchain to provide a robust and secure decentralized computing system. The paper conducts a literature review on Blockchain-based methods capable for the decentralization of the future Internet. To achieve that decentralization, two research aspects of Blockchain have been investigated that are highly relevant in realizing the decentralized Internet. The first aspect is the consensus algorithms, which are vital components for decentralization of Blockchain. We have identified three consensus algorithms being PoP, Paxos, and PoAH to be more adequate for reaching consensus in Blockchain-enabled Internet architecture. The second aspect that we investigated is the impact of future Internet technologies on Blockchain, where their combinations with Blockchain would help to make it overcome its established flaws and be more optimized and applicable for Internet decentralization.","output":"Blockchain for Decentralization of Internet: Prospects, Trends, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A competitive inhibition ELISA was developed to detect non-neutralizing antibodies to the peplomer protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in porcine sera using a monoclonal antibody as an indicator.

However, sampling viable airborne viruses is challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in the ultrafine size range (< 100 nm). Herein, a Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling of virus aerosols. The BASIC utilizes adiabatic expansion in a supersaturated container to activate condensation of water vapor onto virus aerosol particles, thus amplifying the size of the particles by orders of magnitude. Using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, the BASIC's performance was evaluated and optimized both from the perspectives of physical size amplification as well as preservation of the viability of the MS2 bacteriophage. Experimental results show that one compression/expansion (C/E) cycle under a compression pressure of 103.5 kPa and water temperature of 25 C was sufficient to increase the particle diameter from < 100 nm to > 1 m; further increases in the number of C/E cycles neither increased particle number concentration nor diameter. An increase in compression pressure was associated with physical size amplification and a higher concentration of collected viable MS2. Water temperature of 40 C was found to be the optimal for size amplification as well as viability preservation. No significant effect on particle size enlargement was observed by changing the dwell time after expansion. The results illustrate the BASIC's capability as a simple, quick and inexpensive tool for rapid sampling of viable airborne viruses.","output":"An efficient virus aerosol sampler enabled by adiabatic expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic the organization of maternity care changed drastically; this study into the experiences of maternity care professionals with these changes provides suggestions for the organization of care during and after pandemics. DESIGN: An online survey among Dutch midwives, obstetricians and obstetric residents. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associations between the respondents' characteristics and answers. RESULTS: Reported advantages of the changes were fewer prenatal and postpartum consultations (50.1%). The necessity and safety of medical interventions and ultrasounds were considered more critically (75.9%); 14.8% of community midwives stated they referred fewer women to the hospital for decreased fetal movements, whereas 64.2% of the respondents working in hospital-based care experienced fewer consultations for this indication. Respondents felt that women had more confidence in giving birth at home (57.5%). Homebirths seemed to have increased according to 38.5% of the community midwives and 65.3% of the respondents working in hospital-based care. Respondents appreciated the shift to more digital consultations rather than face-to-face consultations. Mentioned disadvantages were that women had appointments alone, (71.1%) and that the community midwife was not allowed to join a woman to obstetric-led care during labour and subsequently stay with her (56.8%). Fewer postpartum visits by family and friends led to more tranquility (59.8%). Overall, however, 48.0% of the respondents felt that the safety of maternity care was compromised due to policy changes. CONCLUSIONS: Maternity care professionals were positive about the decrease in routine care and the increased confidence of women in home birth, but also felt that safety in maternity care was sometimes compromised. According to the respondents in a future crisis situation it should be possible for community midwives to continue to deliver a personal handover after the referral of women to the hospital, and to stay with them.","output":"Experiences of Dutch maternity care professionals during the first wave of COVID-19 in a community based maternity care system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are particularly affected by the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.

The co-occurrence of dementia as a pandemic of old age together with the COVID-19 pandemic has a double impact on persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic poses major challenges for individuals with dementia and their caregivers: (1) People with dementia have limited access to information on COVID-19, may have difficulties with protective measures such as wearing masks and in remembering safety regulations. (2) People with dementia live alone or with their family, or are institutionalized. To reduce the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, Austrian local authorities have banned visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities and implemented strict social-distancing measures. As a result, older people lost face-to-face contact with their family members, became isolated and social activities stopped. Consequently, anxiety, stress and serious concerns about infections among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout during the full lockdown of the facilities. Thus, due to the emerging COVID-19 crisis, the Austrian Alzheimer Association (?sterreichische Alzheimer Gesellschaft, ?AG) and international societies developed recommendations to support people living with dementia and their caregivers on various issues of physical and mental health.","output":"Positionspapier der ?sterreichische Alzheimer Gesellschaft (?AG): Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie in ?sterreich auf Menschen mit Demenz und deren Betreuungsumfeld C Problemfelder, Empfehlungen und Strategien"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis is an ancient disease known to have existed even in the Egyptian civilization.

The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of community-prescribed antibiotics to children aged less than five years attributable to common respiratory viruses. METHODS We fitted time series negative binomial models to predict weekly antibiotic prescribing rates from positive viral pathogen tests for the period April 1st, 2009 through December 27th, 2017 using comprehensive, population-based administrative data for all children (<5 years) living in Scotland. Multiple respiratory viral pathogens were considered, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, and human parainfluenza (HPIV) types 1-4. We estimated the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions explained by virus circulation according to type of virus, by age group, presence of high-risk chronic conditions, and antibiotic class. RESULTS We included data on 6,066,492 antibiotic prescriptions among 452,877 children. The antibiotic prescribing rate among all Scottish children (<5 years) was 609.7 per 1000 child-years.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 4 bacteria and 21 respiratory viruses was run on 92 random nasopharyngeal swabs from children--49 from children living with HIV (CLH) and 43 from HIV uninfected children (HUC)-- and 77 swabs from their parents (44 parents of CLH and 33 parents of HUC). RESULTS: Bacteria was found in 67% of children, viruses in 45%, and both in 27% of child samples. Staphylococcus aureus (53%) was the most common bacteria, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) (37%) in children and parents (53, 20%). Regardless of HIV status, viruses were detected in higher numbers (44%) in children than their parents (30%) (p = 0.049), particularly rhinovirus (p = 0.02).

Results show that summertime thermal comfort will be a major challenge in the future. Energy use for space heating was seen to decrease for periods in the future, also the severity of cold events decreased, resulting in a decline of heating peak loads. Additionally, not considering extreme events was proven to lead to miss-dimensioning thermal systems.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other treatment arms). Patients were twice as likely to be randomised to usual care as to any of the active treatment groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Findings: Between 7 April and 27 November 2020, 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5182 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall, 496 (19%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 997 (19%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.12; p=0.99). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. There was no difference in duration of hospitalisation (median 12 days vs. 13 days) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%; rate ratio 1.03; 95% CI 0.97-1.10; p=0.29). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.89-1.07; p=0.54). Interpretation: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin did not provide any clinical benefit.

Despite advances in the impact of NPIs and the conceptual belief that NPIs and vaccination control COVID-19 infections, we lack evidence to employ control theory in real-world social human dynamics in the context of disease spreading. We bridge the gap by developing a new analytical framework that treats COVID-19 as a feedback control system with the NPIs and vaccination as the controllers and a computational model that maps human social behaviors into input signals. This approach enables us to effectively predict the epidemic spreading in 381 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US by learning our model parameters utilizing the time series NPIs (i.e., the stay-at-home order, face-mask wearing, and testing) data. This model allows us to optimally identify three NPIs to predict infections accurately in 381 MSAs and avoid over-fitting. Our numerical results demonstrate our approachs excellent predictive power with R2 > 0.9 for all the MSAs regardless of their sizes, locations, and demographic status. Our methodology allows us to estimate the needed vaccine coverage and NPIs for achieving Re to a manageable level and how the variants of concern diminish the likelihood for disease elimination at each location. Our analytical results provide insights into the debates surrounding the elimination of COVID-19.

We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques) data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who presented to a Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 2009 and September 2011. RESULTS: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828 immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182 [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89 [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections, such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p < 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Malaria was more likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p < 0.001), whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This analysis of surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice.

In the quantitative strand, a cross-sectional online survey was carried out via a Google form. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test were used for comparisons. In the qualitative strand, twelve participants were interviewed, based on a semi-structured interview guide and audio recorded. Transcribed data were evaluated with thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 final-year medical students were studied in the quantitative strand. Most were females. The mean score for knowledge was 3.35  0.795 out of six.

Noticeably, fewer participants reported to clean their hands after checking blood pressure (55.6 %), and only 66.2 % stated carrying a hand sanitizer in their pocket. Significant correlations were not found between reported behavior and attitudes (p = 0.821) or knowledge (p = 0.794). The qualitative strand with 12 respondents revealed the positive influence of both hierarchical and non-hierarchal role models. Time constraints, skin irritation, and workload pressures were the main barriers. Frequent reminders, supervision, and interactive teaching were suggested as methods to improve hand hygiene compliance. They also stated that increased enthusiasm was noted on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene. Yet, a considerable gap between attitudes and knowledge and reported hand hygiene behavior was evident.

The disease has high heritability. HLA is the major susceptibility factor, and the HLA effect is mediated via presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ variants to CD4+ T cells. In addition to gluten-specific CD4+ T cells the patients have antibodies to transglutaminase 2 (autoantigen) and deamidated gluten peptides. These disease-specific antibodies recognize defined epitopes and they display common usage of specific heavy and light chains across patients. Interactions between T cells and B cells are likely central in the pathogenesis, but how the repertoires of na?ve T and B cells relate to the pathogenic effector cells is unexplored. To this end, we applied machine learning classification models to na?ve B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires from CeD patients and healthy controls. Strikingly, we obtained a promising classification performance with an F1 score of 85%. Clusters of heavy and light chain sequences were inferred and used as features for the model, and signatures associated with the disease were then characterized. These signatures included amino acid (AA) 3-mers with distinct bio-physiochemical characteristics and enriched V and J genes. We found that CeD-associated clusters can be identified and that common motifs can be characterized from na?ve BCR repertoires. The results may indicate a genetic influence by BCR encoding genes in CeD. Analysis of na?ve BCRs as presented here may become an important part of assessing the risk of individuals to develop CeD.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental help-seeking and associated factors among PHW using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (BMHSU). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,475 PHW in five provinces across China between February 18 and March 1, 2020. The subsample data of those who reported probable mental health problems were analyzed for this report (n = 3,417). Logistic and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of predisposing, enabling, need, and COVID-19 contextual factors with mental health help-seeking. Results: Only 12.7% of PHW reported professional mental help-seeking during the COVID-19 outbreak. PHW who were older, had more days of overnight work, received psychological training, perceived a higher level of support from the society, had depression and anxiety were more likely to report mental help-seeking (ORm range: 1.02-1.73, all p < 0.05) while those worked in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were less likely to seek help (ORm = 0.57, p < 0.01). The belief that mental health issues were not the priority (64.4%), lack of time (56.4%), and shortage of psychologists (32.7%) were the most frequently endorsed reasons for not seeking help.

It draws on interviews with managers from eight English local authorities involved in the commissioning and trialling of technologies for adult social care to examine how and why virtual assistants are being implemented, and what implications their use might hold for care. Scaling up the application of such technologies could shift the role of local authorities towards one of an app developer and data broker, while generating considerable risks of reliance on the precarious technological infrastructure of global corporations that may have little interest in or sensitivity towards local care concerns. The findings suggest an urgent need for a national social care technology strategy and increased support for local authorities.","output":"The Alexafication of Adult Social Care: Virtual Assistants and the Changing Role of Local Government in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Practicing regular physical activity in green spaces has been invocated as a promising strategy for improving wellbeing in urban settings.

Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the same information.","output":"COVID-19 Deterioration Prediction via Self-Supervised Representation Learning and Multi-Image Prediction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of COVID-19 around the world Many governments will obligate and enforce mask-wearing This caused a lot of dissatisfaction This is mainly because wearing a mask can cause respiratory discomfort and hypoxia This is considered harmful to health However, the anti-epidemic effect of masks is remarkable, and there is no other better anti-epidemic plan Wearing masks is still the mainstream Therefore, reducing the side effects of masks has become particularly important This article proposes a new solution That is, Umm~ speaks and breathes This is an active-controlled breathing mode It can increase respiratory efficiency, thereby increasing the oxygen content in the body In experiments to evaluate the body's oxygen content, we use blood oxygen saturation as an indicator Experimental results show that the normal breathing mode cannot meet the human body's blood oxygen demand under the condition of wearing a mask The Umm~ vocal breathing can significantly alleviate the decline in blood oxygen saturation After using this method, blood oxygen saturation increased by approximately 2 5% ? 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group?","output":"On an Umm~ vocal breathing pattern to im-prove blood oxygen saturation when wearing a mask"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are living in uncertain times and facing a paradigm shift in human health and sustainability.

We attempt to determine the incidence of barotrauma in intubated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Methods: Retrospective observation case series of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were intubated in the ICU. Data were collected for a total of 3 months from electronic health records on patients age, sex, BMI, incidence of barotrauma, total length of intubation and outcome.Results: Ninteen out of the 100 included patients developed barotrauma as defined by radiographic evidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema. The average BMI of patients with barotrauma was 32.06 kg/m2 with an average age of 56.84 years and 9 patients being classified as obese (BMI 30 kg/m2). Fourteen out of 19 patients (73%) with barotrauma were intubated for 10 or more days with a median of 16.52 days. The overall mortality rate was noted to be 92% amongst intubated patients.Conclusion: Rate of barotrauma in COVID-19 intubated patients was noted to be 19% in our study, which is on par with the rate of ventilator-induced barotrauma with the previous SARS virus-associated ARDS, and higher than that of the general population with ARDS. Patients who developed barotrauma were also noted to be intubated for a significantly longer duration (16.52 days) as compared to their non-barotrauma counterparts.

Improving indoor air quality can be achieved through the buildings HVAC system to decrease any concentration of indoor contaminants by dilution and/or by source removal. However, doing so has practical downsides on the HVAC operation that are not always quantified in the literature. This paper develops a temporal simulation capability that is used to investigate the indoor virus concentration and operational cost of an HVAC system for two mitigation strategies: (1) supplying 100% outdoor air into the building and (2) using different HVAC filters, including MERV 10, MERV 13, and HEPA filters. These strategies are applied to a hypothetical medium office building consisting of five occupied zones and located in a cold and dry climate. We modeled the building using the Modelica Buildings library and developed new models for HVAC filtration and virus transmission to evaluate COVID-19 scenarios. We show that the ASHRAE-recommended MERV 13 filtration reduces the average virus concentration by about 10% when compared to MERV 10 filtration, with an increase in site energy consumption of about 3%. In contrast, the use of 100% outdoor air reduces the average indoor concentration by about an additional 1% compared to MERV 13 filtration, but significantly increases heating energy consumption. Use of HEPA filtration increases the average indoor concentration and energy consumption compared to MERV 13 filtration due to the high resistance of the HEPA filter.","output":"Investigation of HVAC operation strategies for office buildings during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blockchain technologies have been benefiting many industries by being decentralized, secure and confidential. They offer great potential in pandemic impacted scenarios as well. Contact tracing helps to mitigate the transmission of disease by alerting people who may have been exposed so they can act on time to protect themselves. Contact tracing systems face some challenges related to issues of medical privacy, data security and transparency. Multiple researches show concern that contact tracing discourages people to seek medication because of the fear of loss of data, subsequent stigma, discrimination, or abuse. In this paper, we discuss how contact tracing can be improved using blockchain technology and could be able to solve these issues. The aim of our proposed system would be to reduce the impact of pandemic, to implement this merger of the blockchains and the Contact tracing app and to ensure user privacy and avoid data misuse by incorporating a symmetric key cryptographic mechanism. To tackle the scalability related issues of Blockchain this framework uses IPFS, a distributed file storage system also known as Interplanetary File System.

Development of a standardised set of outcomes would resolve these issues. This study provides the definitive core outcome set (COS) for fistulising pCD. DESIGN Candidate outcomes were generated through a systematic review and patient interviews. Consensus was established via a three-round Delphi process using a 9-point Likert scale based on how important they felt it was in determining treatment success culminating in a final consensus meeting. Stakeholders were recruited nationally and grouped into three panels (surgeons and radiologists, gastroenterologists and IBD specialist nurses, and patients). Participants received feedback from their panel (in the second round) and all participants (in the third round) to allow refinement of their scores. RESULTS A total of 295 outcomes were identified from systematic reviews and interviews that were categorised into 92 domains. 187 stakeholders (response rate 78.5%) prioritised 49 outcomes through a three-round Delphi study. The final consensus meeting of 41 experts and patients generated agreement on an eight domain COS. The COS comprised three patient-reported outcome domains (quality of life, incontinence and a combined score of patient priorities) and five clinician-reported outcome domains (perianal disease activity, development of new perianal abscess/sepsis, new/recurrent fistula, unplanned surgery and faecal diversion). CONCLUSION A fistulising pCD COS has been produced by all key stakeholders.

The objective of this research project is to progress our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 assembly. Our central hypothesis is that M through its interaction with host lipids coordinates viral protein interactions and RNP packaging as key processes for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and spread. The role of lipids as molecules regulating the viral life cycle is poorly investigated. Our current data demonstrates a clear binding of cell expressed M to a Golgi resident sphingolipid. Furthermore, mutations at the sphingolipid binding motif resulted in deficient pull down of M protein by sphingolipid coated beads. In cells, the M sphingolipid-binding mutant failed to retain S protein at viral assembly membranes resulting in a reduced entry capacity of newly formed virus-like particles. Our current study is providing a first insight on the direct role of host lipids during SARS-CoV-2 assembly, orchestrated by the M protein.","output":"Host lipids required for Membrane protein matrix formation in new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), ribonucleocapsid packaging and viral assembly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Structured reporting (SR) in radiology has been recognized recently by major scientific societies.

STUDY DESIGN: From March 2013 through March 2015 we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 pre-term) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to four months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards (TAC) were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real time PCR. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all pre-term infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. RESULTS: Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk pre-term infants in our Level IV regional NICU. Only four infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in pre-term infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community. Once discharged from the hospital viral respiratory infections were common in all infants.

Methods Between July 2017 and February 2020, medical and surgical patients from nine ICUs at a single tertiary care hospital were accompanied by a uniquely trained volunteer Transition Guide to aid them at the time of transfer to general medical/surgical wards, when available. If a Transition Guide was not available, they were transferred without one. The following day, patients were surveyed with a tool assessing overall satisfaction, multiple aspects in the domain of communication, and psychological stress associated with the transition process. When available, family members and ward nurses who admitted patients from the ICU were surveyed. Results Target enrollment was 300 patients in each group. Due to COVID-19 and institutional restrictions on volunteers, only 264 underwent transfer with a Guide, while 305 transferred without. Of all patients approached, 96% without a Guide and 95% with a Guide completed the survey. Patients who were accompanied by a Transition Guide reported a better overall transition, better communication, greater understanding, better resolution of concerns, and less stress than those who did not have a Transition Guide (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion Among a cohort of formerly critically ill patients subsequently transferred to general medical and surgical wards, the presence of a volunteer Transition Guide significantly improved patient experience, enhanced patient communication and understanding, and reduced stress associated with the transfer process.

Recently, CHWs have been recognised as important players in the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite this recognition, little understanding exists in Ghana about the activities of CHWs: who they are; how they are recruited; what they do; level of health policy support; contribution to healthcare delivery and the challenges they face. Based on a rapid scoping review of the existing literature, and our experience working in Ghana, this paper reflects on the role of CHWs in healthcare delivery in Ghana. We argue that CHWs have played critical roles in improving health service delivery and outcomes, including guinea worm eradication, expanded immunisation coverage, maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS treatment and management. However, these achievements notwithstanding, CHWs face challenges which prevent them from being optimally productive, including capacity problems, neglect by the healthcare system, high attrition rates and inadequate supervision.

This study assessed the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions for acute surgical conditions and the subsequent impact on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was an observational analytical study, evaluating data from a national discharge database that collected all discharge reports from any hospital in France. All adult patients admitted through the emergency department and requiring a surgical treatment between 17 March and 11 May 2020, and the equivalent period in 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the change in number of hospital admissions for acute surgical conditions. Mortality was assessed in the matched population, and stratified by region. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, 57 589 consecutive patients were admitted for acute surgical conditions, representing a decrease of 20.9 per cent compared with the 2019 cohort. Significant differences between regions were observed: the decrease was 15.6, 17.2, and 26.8 per cent for low-, intermediate- and high-prevalence regions respectively. The mortality rate was 1.92 per cent during the lockdown period and 1.81 per cent in 2019. In high-prevalence zones, mortality was significantly increased (odds ratio 1.22, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.40).

Since their identification, RVs are the leading cause of enteritis and diarrhea in humans and various animal species, and are also associated with abridged growth, particularly in avian species. Recently, RVD has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of runting and stunting syndrome (RSS), alongside other viruses such as reovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and others, all of which cause colossal economic losses to the poultry industry. RVD has been reported from several countries worldwide, and to date, only one complete genome sequence for RVD is available. Neither an immunodiagnostic nor a vaccine is available for the detection and prevention of RVD infection.

Risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) have not yet been well determined. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-centered, observational study, in which 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled from February 24 to April 5, 2020. The patients were registered from the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the risk factors of death in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS The study cohort included 47 adult patients with an average age of 70.5512.52 years, and 30 (63.8%) patients were men. Totally 15 (31.9%) patients died. When compared to survivors, nonsurvivors showed a higher proportion of septic shock [6 (40%) patients vs. 3 (9.4%) patients], disseminated intravascular coagulation [3 (21.4%) vs. 0], and had higher score of APACHE II (25.078.03 vs. 15.565.95), CURB-65 {3 [2-4] vs. 2 [1-3]}, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) {7 [5-9] vs. 3 [1-6]}, higher level of D-dimer {5.74 [2.32-18] vs 2.05 [1.09-4.00]} and neutrophil count {9.4 [7.68-14.54] vs. 5.32 [3.85-9.34]}. SOFA score (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.13; P=0.0042) and the lymphocyte count (OR 0.02; 95% CI: 0.00-0.86; P=0.042) on admission were independently risk factors for mortality. Patients with higher lymphocyte count (>0.63109 /L) and lower SOFA score (4) on admission had a significantly better prognosis than those with lower lymphocyte count (0.63109 /L) and higher SOFA score (>4) in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Higher SOFA score and lower lymphocyte count at admission were connected with poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in ICU.

Lack of proper provider/patient communication on next steps after testing, not being aware that results are ready; and other competing priorities are some of the reasons for this failure. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of Short Message Service (SMS) technology and ward-based outreach teams (WBOTs) in improving TB treatment initiation. A 3-arm randomized controlled trial (Standard of care-SOC, SMS technology or WBOTs) was conducted between September 2018 and April 2020. Newly diagnosed TB patients randomly allocated to SMS and WBOTs groups were sent reminder messages (text message or paper slip respectively) that results were ready. Due to unforeseen challenges (financial and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic), implementation was only in two of the eight clinics planned. RESULTS: 314 TB patients were assigned to one of three groups (SOC = 104, WBOTs = 105, and SMS = 105). Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions starting treatment (primary outcome). More patients in the SMS group (92/105; 88%) initiated treatment than in the SOC group (81/104; 78%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.062). The time to treatment initiation was significantly shorter in the SMS group than in the SOC group (P < 0.001). The proportions of patients initiated on treatment in the WBOTs group (45/62; 73%) and in the SOC group (44/61; 72%) were similar (P = 0.956). The times to treatment initiation for these two groups were also similar. The 3 group analysis yielded similar proportions initiated on treatment (P = 0.048 for SMS/SOC comparison and P = 0.956 for WBOTs/SOC comparison) but analysis of times to treatment initiation yielded some variations. CONCLUSION: Reminder SMS messages sent to newly diagnosed TB patients improved the time to treatment initiation. Further research is required to show effect of the WBOTs intervention.

However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. Results: We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points.

It can be shockingly effective at finding bugs, but it often requires generating a very large number of inputs to do so. In this paper, we apply ideas from combinatorial testing, a powerful and widely studied testing methodology, to modify the distributions of our random generators so as to find bugs with fewer tests. The key concept is combinatorial coverage, which measures the degree to which a given set of tests exercises every possible choice of values for every small combination of input features. In its classical form, combinatorial coverage only applies to programs whose inputs have a very particular shapeessentially, a Cartesian product of finite sets. We generalize combinatorial coverage to the richer world of algebraic data types by formalizing a class of sparse test descriptions based on regular tree expressions. This new definition of coverage inspires a novel combinatorial thinning algorithm for improving the coverage of random test generators, requiring many fewer tests to catch bugs.

Trauma centers may be uniquely impacted, given the need for rapid invasive interventions in severely injured and the growing incidence of community infection. We discuss the impact that SARS-CoV-2 has had in our trauma center and our steps to limit the potential exposures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of the trauma service, from March 16 to 30, following the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in our state. We recorded the daily number of trauma patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the presence of clinical symptoms or radiological signs of COVID-19, and the results of verbal symptom screen (for new admissions). The number of trauma activations, admissions, and census, as well as staff exposures and infections, was recorded daily. RESULTS: Over the 14-day evaluation period, we tested 85 trauma patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 21 (25%) were found to be positive. Sixty percent of the patients in the trauma/burn intensive care unit were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Positive verbal screen results, presence of ground glass opacities on admission chest CT, and presence of clinical symptoms were not significantly different in patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection (p > 0.05).

Social media have emerged as a major means of human communication. However, a major limitation in such media is the lack of non-verbal stimuli, which sometimes hinders the understanding of the message, and in particular the associated emotional content. In an effort to compensate for this, people started to use emoticons, which are combinations of keyboard characters that resemble facial expressions, and more recently their evolution: emojis, namely, small colorful images that resemble faces, actions and daily life objects. This paper presents evidence of the effect of emojis on memory retrieval through a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. A total number of fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for the experiment, during which successive stimuli were presented, containing words with intense emotional content combined with emojis, either with congruent or incongruent emotional content. Volunteers were asked to recall a memory related to the stimulus. The study of the reaction times showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations led to longer reaction times in memory retrieval compared to congruent combinations. General Linear Model (GLM) and Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods have been tested in assessing the influence of the emojis on the process of memory retrieval. The analysis of the fMRI data showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations activated the Broca's area (BA44 and BA45) in both hemispheres, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA47), compared to congruent combinations.

Many studies have investigated the annual mean climate impact of aviation emissions. While CO2 has a long atmospheric residence time and is almost uniformly distributed in the atmosphere, non-CO2 gases and particles and their products have short atmospheric residence times and are heterogeneously distributed. The climate impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions is known to vary with different meteorological background situations. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the influence of characteristic weather situations on aviation climate effects over the North Atlantic region, to identify the most sensitive areas, and to potentially detect systematic weather-related similarities. If aircraft were re-routed to avoid climate-sensitive regions, the overall aviation climate impact might be reduced. Hence, the sensitivity of the atmosphere to local emissions provides a basis for the assessment of weather-related, climate-optimized flight trajectory planning. To determine the climate change contribution of an individual emission as a function of location, time, and weather situation, the radiative impact of local emissions of NOx and H2O to changes in O3, CH4, H2O and contrail cirrus was computed by means of the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry model. From this, 4-dimensional climate change functions (CCFs) were derived. Typical weather situations in the North Atlantic region were considered for winter and summer. Weather-related differences in O3, CH4, H2O, and contrail cirrus CCFs were investigated. The following characteristics were identified: enhanced climate impact of contrail cirrus was detected for emissions in areas with large-scale lifting, whereas low climate impact of contrail cirrus was found in the area of the jet stream. Northwards of 60 N, contrails usually cause climate warming in winter, independent of the weather situation. NOx emissions cause a high positive climate impact if released in the area of the jet stream or in high-pressure ridges, which induces a south- and downward transport of the emitted species, whereas NOx emissions at, or transported towards, high latitudes cause low or even negative climate impact. Independent of the weather situation, total NOx effects show a minimum at 250 hPa, increasing towards higher and lower altitudes, with generally higher positive impact in summer than in winter. H2O emissions induce a high climate impact when released in regions with lower tropopause height, whereas low climate impact occurs for emissions in areas with higher tropopause height. H2O CCFs generally increase with height and are larger in winter than in summer. The CCFs of all individual species can be combined, facilitating the assessment of total climate impact of aircraft trajectories considering CO2 and spatially and temporally varying non-CO2 effects. Furthermore, they allow for the optimization of aircraft trajectories with reduced overall climate impact. This also facilitates a fair evaluation of trade-offs between individual species. In most regions, NOx and contrail cirrus dominate the sensitivity to local aviation emissions. The findings of this study recommend considering weather-related differences for flight trajectory optimization in favour of reducing total climate impact.","output":"Influence of weather situation on non-CO2 aviation climate effects: the REACT4C climate change functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of weak magnetic field (WMF) on Acid Orange 7 (AO7) removal by ZnO@Fe3O4/peroxymonosulphate (PMS) was investigated.

Amongst different forms of bioenergy, lignocellulosic biomass can be utilized as an attractive substrate for the production of several high-value products owing to its renewability, easy availability, and abundance. Additionally, utilization of these waste biomasses reduces the environmental hazards associated with its disposal. Impedance of lignin and crystalline nature of cellulose pose major bottlenecks in biomass based energy. Though, several physio-chemicals processes are recommended as mitigation route but none of them seems to be promising for large scale application. In recent years, a right fusion of biological treatment combined with nanotechnology for efficient pretreatment and subsequent hydrolysis of biomass by ubiquitous enzymes seems to be promising alternative. In addition, to overcome these difficulties, nanotechnology-based methods have been recently adopted in catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. The present review has critically discussed the application of nano-biotechnology in lignocellulosic biomass valorization in terms of pretreatment and hydrolysis. A detailed discussion on the application of various nanoparticles in these processes, enzyme immobilization and end-production utilization is presented in this review.

Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic spread throughout the world from the beginning of 2020, increasing healthcare professionals workloads and levels of physical and emotional stress. Aims: To determine the prevalence of burnout syndrome in Spanish radiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with the development of this syndrome, and to compare these findings with those obtained before the pandemic. Methods: This observation study took place between April 2020 and August 2020 (during the pandemic) through an online survey. A total of 150 responses were obtained. Demographic and work-related information was compiled. Burnout syndrome was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). The prevalence and characteristics of burnout syndrome obtained in this survey were compared with those of the same survey done in 2019. We performed a statistical analysis to identify possible risk factors and protective factors associated with this syndrome and to determine the homogeneity of the two samples. Results: The prevalence of burnout syndrome increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (49.3% vs. 33.6%, p=0.002). No risk factors or protective factors that were valid both before and after the pandemic were identified. No correlations were identified between sociodemographic or work-related characteristics and burnout syndrome. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that burnout syndrome increased significantly in radiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting nearly half of all those who responded to the survey. These results underline the need to assess support for professional wellbeing of radiologists in Spain. No correlations were identified between burnout and gender, age, number of calls, years in the job, annual income, teaching, marital status, number of children, or type of contract.","output":"Prevalencia y factores de desgaste profesional en radilogos durante la pandemia COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article offers an ethnographic account of how interactional expectations changed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, making it difficult for people to create social objects, and experience ?reality? together in ?normal? ways The situations where people do their identity work changed, as did expectations about ordinary language use, and social accounting practices Even the experience of space and time changed Because new practices (wearing masks and saying ?Stay safe?) emerged rapidly, they were often initially unrecognizable to others, making coordinated action difficult, and increasing uncertainty Existing inequalities of race class, and gender, usually tacit, became much more visible In what follows, we describe situations where these changes took place, interpreting our findings through a lens suggested by Goffman, Garfinkel, Du Bois and Durkheim ? 2020 Societa Editrice il Mulino All rights reserved","output":"Interactional expectations reconfigure in the time of Covid-19: Implications for the uncertainty of social ?reality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an era of several therapeutic options available, optimal treatment sequencing is crucial to providing patients the most effective therapy and promoting quality of life.

The effects of viral proteins on cell viability, pro-inflammatory cytokines production, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were investigated. Filamentous NLPs did not induce inflammation while spherical VLPs mediated inflammatory response followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

As the number of biotech projects grows, so does the need to establish processes to improve project management effectiveness and project success, including assessing their impacts (positive and negative) on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). This broader approach opens the door to developing a new project management (PM) paradigm designated by sustainable project management (SPM). However, there is a need for more empirical studies to understand how sustainability can be integrated into project management. This research is based on the proposition that PM maturity could lead to incorporating sustainability in PM. No research studies are reported in the literature exploring this interrelationship between maturity and sustainable project management;such is this studys purpose and originality. The study applies Kerzners Level 3 PM maturity model on a sample of 96 biotech companies in Portugal through a questionnaire that addressed project managers and team members. The findings suggest that the process of integrating sustainability into PM should follow these steps: (1) perform an early PM maturity diagnosis to identify the companys most and least dominated areas;(2) identify the strengths and weaknesses that impact the integration of sustainability into project management practices;(3) develop a customized and adjusted action plan to integrate sustainability in PM. The studys main contribution relies on understanding how sustainability can be integrated into project management, explaining the role of maturity assessment in this process.

To reduce the rate of head injury in cycling, knowing the nature of real-world head impacts is crucial. Reverse engineering real-world bike helmet impacts in a laboratory setting is an alternative to measuring head impacts directly. This study aims to quantify bike helmet damage using computed tomography (CT) and reconstruct real-world damage with a custom, oblique test rig to recreate real-world impacts. Damaged helmets were borrowed from a helmet manufacturer who runs a helmet warranty program. Each helmet was CT-scanned and the damage metrics were quantified. Helmets of the same model and size were used for in-lab reconstructions of the damaged helmets where normal velocity, tangential velocity, peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational velocity (PRV) could be measured. The damage metrics of the in-lab dropped helmets were quantified using the same CT scanning process. For each case, a multiple linear regression (MLR) equation was created to define a relationship between the quantified damage metrics of the in-lab tested helmets and the associated measured impact velocities and kinematics. These equations were used to predict the impact kinematics and velocities from the corresponding real-world damaged helmet based on the damage metrics from the original damaged helmet. Average normal velocity (3.5 m/s), tangential velocity (2.5 m/s), PLA (108.0 g), PRV (15.7 rad/s) were calculated based on a sample of 23 helmets. Within these head impact cases, five notes reported a concussion. The difference between the average PLA and PRV for concussive cases versus other impacts were not significantly different, although the average impact kinematics for the concussive cases (PLA = 111.4 g, PRV = 18.5 rad/s) were slightly higher than the remaining cases (PLA = 107.1 g, PRV = 15.0 rad/s).

We investigated the epidemiology of sHCoV infection during the first year of life, including risk factors and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of infants enrolled in a birth cohort near Cape Town, South Africa, from 2012 to 2015. LRTI surveillance was implemented, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected fortnightly over infancy. Quantitative PCR detected respiratory pathogens, including coronaviruses-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1. Swabs were tested from infants at the time of LRTI and from the 90 days prior as well as from age-matched control infants from the cohort over the equivalent period. RESULTS: In total, 885 infants were included, among whom 464 LRTI events occurred. Of the 4751 samples tested for sHCoV, 9% tested positive, with HCoV-NL63 the most common. Seasonal HCoV detection was associated with LRTI; this association was strongest for coronavirus-OC43, which was also found in all sHCoV-associated hospitalizations. Birth in winter was associated with sHCoV-LRTI, but there were no clear seasonal differences in detection. Co-detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae was weakly associated with sHCoV-LRTI (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-3.6); detection of other respiratory viruses or bacteria was not associated with sHCoV status. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal HCoV infections were common and associated with LRTI, particularly sHCoV-OC43, which is most closely related to the SARS group of coronaviruses.

Recent work suggested that mismatch repair deficient CRCs may not benefit from 5FU adjuvant chemotherapy but studies remain conflicting. We aimed to determine if gender, tumor site, tumor pathological characteristics and microsatellite instability (MSI) predict survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage C CRC. METHODS Data were collated on ACPS (Australian Clinico-pathological Staging System) stage C CRC cases that underwent curative resection over a 23-year period. Pathology was reevaluated, DNA was extracted from the formalin-fixed paraffin specimen, and MSI status was established by BAT26 instability. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard model and effects modification interaction testing. RESULTS In total 814 unselected cases were included, of whom 37% received chemotherapy. Seventy-seven cases exhibited MSI. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy produced a cancer-specific survival benefit (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.70; P < 0.0001). On interaction testing, none of the examined parameters significantly influenced the magnitude of that survival benefit. Chemotherapy was beneficial in both the MSI (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.27; P = < 0.0001) and the microsatellite stable cohort (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81; P = 0.001).

RECENT FINDINGS For the past 25 years, daily social media usage has risen continually, allowing information to spread widely to a reading/listening/viewing audience via mostly unvetted social media sites. During a pandemic/epidemic (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic), an overabundance of information from many sources, including social media, has led to what is now termed as an 'infodemic'. Infodemics arise from overwhelming amounts of both correct and incorrect information from experts and nonexperts alike. Differentiating correct from incorrect information is difficult for social media users who can be swayed by nonscientific 'influencers' or fear-mongering more than by vetted expert scientific information. Consequently, vaccine misinformation is steadily increasing via social media, the use of which is often believed to be associated with vaccine hesitancy.

Previous analyses have studied COVID-related deaths, but these were under-recorded early in the pandemic due to paucity of virological testing. We propose a novel method to identify excess mortality during the pandemic by accounting for usual all-cause mortality in pre-pandemic years using a large electronic primary care database. We estimated the impact of risk factors (RFs) on excess mortality during the first wave and compared these with the impact of the same RFs on total mortality in non-pandemic times.MethodsAn average of 4.8 million patients aged 30C104 years active in 770 CPRD Aurum practices between 18th March and 19th May over a 6-year period (2015C2020) were included. Concurrent medical history, ethnicity, area-based deprivation and fatalities were extracted for each year. Poisson regression models fitted total mortality adjusting for age and sex, with interactions between each RF and the pandemic and reference periods. Total mortality during the pandemic was partitioned into usual and excess components, assuming 2015C19 rates represented usual mortality. The association of each RF with the 2020 excess component was derived as the excess mortality ratio (EMR), to compare with the usual mortality ratio (UMR).ResultsRFs where excess mortality was greatest and notably higher than usual were age >80, black ethnicity, BMI>40, dementia, learning disability, London practices and people in care-homes. For example, people of black ethnicity vs. white had an EMR=2.50 (95%CI 1.97C3.18) compared to a UMR=0.92 (95%CI 0.85C1.00). Excess mortality was more comparable to usual mortality for sex and area deprivation. The EMR for men (1.46, 95%CI 1.32C1.60) was not significantly different than the UMR=1.34 (95%CI 1.32C1.37). The EMR=2.05 (95%CI 1.76C2.38) in the most deprived quintile (vs. least) was only slightly higher than the UMR=1.70 (95%CI 1.65C1.75). Although some RFs produced EMRs significantly lower than their UMRs (Cancer, COPD), the EMRs were still >1. However, current smoking was inversely associated with excess mortality: while current smokers were 64% more likely to die than non-smokers in 2020, when the UMR=2.12 (95%CI 2.07C2.18) was accounted for, the EMR=0.80 (95%CI 0.65C0.98).ConclusionUtilising large electronic patient databases to study trends in excess mortality during the pandemic confirmed some reported findings (e.g. ethnicity, obesity and care-homes), but also highlighted important differences not apparent from studying cause specific mortality during the pandemic (e.g. smoking, sex and area deprivation).","output":"Comparative analysis of risk factors for excess and usual mortality during the first 2020 COVID-19 pandemic phase in England*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on potentially harmful alcohol consumption is unclear.

Methods In the US, we examined rates of consuming alcohol [] 4 times in the past week at baseline (March, 2020) and across four waves of follow-up (April-May, 2020). In the UK we assessed the prevalence of consuming alcohol [] 4 times per week and weekly heavy episodic drinking using the AUDIT-C at baseline (2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). We also tested whether there were specific groups at greater risk of increased problem drinking during the pandemic. Results Among US adults, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of participants reporting drinking alcohol [] 4 times a week which rose significantly from 11.7% to 17.9% (53% increase, p < .001) as the COVID-19 crisis developed in the US. Among UK adults, the percentage of participants reporting drinking [] 4 times a week increased significantly from 14.2% to 23% (62% increase, p < .001) and heavy episodic drinking at least weekly increased significantly from 9.7% to 16.6% (71% increase, p < .001) when compared to pre-COVID-19 lockdown levels. Trends were similar across population demographics, although those aged under 50 years and higher income groups displayed the largest increases. Conclusions The COVID-19 crisis has been associated with substantial increases in problematic drinking in both US and UK adults.","output":"Problem drinking before and during the COVID-19 crisis in US and UK adults: Evidence from two population-based longitudinal studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is an effective method for prevention of infectious diseases, but when the number of available vaccines is limited, it is not possible to vaccinate everyone in a society In this paper, a two-step model is proposed to distribute a limited number of vaccines among the people of a society, in a way that would disrupt the transmission chain of the infectious disease most efficiently In the first step, the vaccines are allocated to different communities in the society (e g cities in a country), and in the second step, the individuals whose vaccination removes the greatest number of transmission routes for the infection are identified in concordance with the regulations of international health organizations In the second step, contact data is obtained from cellular networks and Bluetooth signals, and a graph-based modeling scheme is utilized in conjunction with a combined susceptibility metric specifically designed for selection of these individuals The simulations indicate that a 30 % drop in infection rate compared to random vaccination could be achieved ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Targeted vaccination for COVID-19 using mobile communication networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers contemporary developments in public health intelligence (PHI), especially their focus on health events of pandemic potential.

With a focus on non-traditional PHI activities, the article first situates the study of PHI in relation to the sociology of public health. It then discusses the conceptualisation and actualisation of pandemics, reflecting on how public health professionals and organisations must equip themselves with diverse allies in order to realise the claims they make about pandemic phenomena. Finally, using the analytic tools of actor-network theory, sites for future empirical research that can contribute to the sociology of pandemics are suggested.","output":"Public health intelligence and the detection of potential pandemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Horizontal care, in which clinicians assume roles outside of their usual responsibilities, is an important health care systems response to emergency situations. Allocating residents and fellows into skill-concordant clinical roles, however, is challenging. The most efficient method to accomplish graduate medical education (GME) assessment and deployment for horizontal care is not known. Objective We designed a categorization schema that can efficiently facilitate clinical and educational horizontal care delivery for trainees within a given institution. Methods In September 2019, as part of a general emergency response preparation, a 4-tiered system of trainee categorization was developed at one academic medical center. All residents and fellows were mapped to this system. This single institution model was disseminated to other institutions in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect hospitals nationally. In March 2020, a multi-institution collaborative launched the Trainee Pandemic Role Allocation Tool (TPRAT), which allows institutions to map institutional programs to COVID-19 roles within minutes. This was disseminated to other GME programs for use and refinement. Results The emergency response preparation plan was disseminated and selectively implemented with a positive response from the emergency preparedness team, program directors, and trainees. The TPRAT website was visited more than 100 times in the 2 weeks after its launch. Institutions suggested rapid refinements via webinars and e-mails, and we developed an online user's manual.

A meta-analysis to evaluate the mortality in patients with PPFs managed during the current COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies were conducted with a search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases using appropriate keywords from January 01, 2020 to January 29, 2021. Results: 35 relevant studies reporting 4255 patients with hip fracture in the current ongoing pandemic, out of which 692 patients were COVID-19 positive. Twenty studies reported mortality and other relevant statistics on hip fracture patients with and without COVID-19 (4123 hip fracture patients in the year 2020-21, out of which 560 had or were suspected of having COVID -19). A meta-analysis of mortality statistics in patients with and without COVID revealed increased odds of mortality among COVID patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.09, 7.83] and meta-analysis on the subgroup of surgically treated patients also showed markedly increased mortality risk among those with COVID-19 (OR) 5.99, 95% CI [3.88,9.24]. Conclusion: The mortality risk is markedly increased in hip fracture with concomitant COVID-19 as compared to those without it. This increased risk persisted in those managed surgically. It could be due to the inflammation induced by the fracture or surgery for fracture fixation, further exacerbating inflammation, leading to cytokine storm. It is imperative that such patients are informed regarding increased mortality risk during the consent and shared decision-making process.","output":"Mortality escalates in patients of proximal femoral fractures with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies on 4255 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered changes in the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment delivery system, in the availability of legal and illicit drugs, and in other social and economic factors. As such, these changes necessitate that the field re-evaluate research approaches to SUDs, including in epidemiology, clinical trials, health services, implementation and policy research, as well as basic and translational neuroscience. COVID-19 has reduced researchers' access to target populations and made it difficult for them to obtain timely data to monitor changes in patterns of drug use and overdoses. These changes have increased researchers' interest in virtual technologies to expand and accelerate access to populations; increased modifications in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials; and increased emphasis on implementation.

Methods We updated a living systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. In this update we modified our inclusion criteria to include: 1) cohort studies;2) cross-sectional studies that investigated and cross-assessed SARS-COV-2 positivity rates in schools and communities;and 3) pre-post studies. We performed risk of bias evaluation for all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results 6270 articles were retrieved and six new studies were added in this update. In total from the two updates and using the new inclusion criteria, we identified 11 cohort studies (1st update: n = 5;2nd update: n = 6) and one cross-sectional study (1st update: n = 1;2nd update: n = 0). We performed a meta-analysis on nine of the 11 cohort studies investigating IAR in schools. Nine cohort studies reported a total of 91 student and 52 staff index cases that exposed 5698 contacts with 101 secondary infections (overall infection attack rate (IAR) = 1.45%, 95% CI = 0.31%-3.26%). IARs for students and school staff were 1.66% (95% CI = 0.08%-4.78%) and 1.18% (95% CI = 0.00%-4.43%) respectively.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational questionnaire-based study to assess the satisfaction level of the students. The questionnaire had 25 items of which 23 were questions with responses on the Likert scale and two items on views and suggestions were open-ended. The online questionnaire was shared through various messaging/mailing platforms. Overall satisfaction was assessed, and a satisfaction index was calculated for each item. Data are presented in frequencies and percentages, and SPSS was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1068 students participated in the study. The majority were from the age group 21C23 years (54%) and there was almost the same number of participants from both genders. The majority of the students were medical undergraduates (n=919), were in their second year (n=669), belonged to a government institution (n=897) and used a mobile phone for their online classes (n = 871). The majority of the students were dissatisfied (42%) with no significant difference between medical and nursing students (p = 0.192). First-year students were significantly dissatisfied compared with other senior students (p = 0.005). The maximum satisfaction index (78.23%) was observed with faculties being supportive and responsive in resolving the queries and the minimum (46.39%) was observed with issues related to communication and discussion with peer students. There were 662 responses as views which mostly contained negative comments regarding interaction and focus, practical learning, teaching content, and technological/infrastructural flaws.

He left the latter project mid-way through to become part of a small group that drafted the Czechoslovakian Declaration of Independence in November 1918. We show how Miller developed a distinctive approach to Americanization through his idea of proportional patriotism that challenged the dominant discourse of assimilation that became entrenched in the years after the end of the first world war and which was largely accepted by Park and by Thomas.

All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020 in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1 to 13 days) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3 to 24 days).

PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients who underwent radiofrequency denervation for low back pain. METHODS: Correlations, between the average percentage of pain relief from diagnostic medial branch block (MBB) and RF denervation procedure outcome, and between SST and RF denervation procedure outcome, were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficient (r(s)). Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to assess whether magnitude and duration of pain relief following RF denervation differed by the levels of SST (<0.5 and 0.5) or pain relief (<80% and 80%) from diagnostic MBB. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between pain relief after diagnostic MBB and pain relief 2 weeks after denervation (r(s) 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.51, p < 0.01), but not between pain relief after MBB and pain relief 6 months after denervation, nor pain relief duration after denervation.

Whether the beneficial effect of reperfusion also leads to a reduction in long term mortality is unknown. METHODS Patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy between January 2010 and December 2018 were included. The post-thrombectomy degree of reperfusion and emboli in new territories were core laboratory adjudicated. Reperfusion was evaluated according to the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale. Vital status was obtained from the Swiss population register. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using time split Cox regression models were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with borderline indications. RESULTS Our study included 1264 patients (median follow-up per patient 2.5 years). Patients with successful reperfusion had longer survival times, attributable to a lower hazard of death within 0-90 days and for >90 days to 2 years (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.46; aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.62). This association was homogeneous across all predefined subgroups (p for interaction >0.05).

Analysis results indicate that the replacement of NC with the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV N resulted in the production of wild type (wt)-level virus-like particles (VLPs) with the density of a wt HIV-1 particle. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N, chimeras containing the N carboxyl-terminal half sequence efficiently packaged N. However, the same was not true for the chimera bearing the N amino-terminal half sequence, despite its production of substantial amounts of VLPs. According to further analysis, HIV-1 NC replacement with N residues 2C213, 215C421, or 234C421 resulted in efficient VLP production at levels comparable to that of wt HIV-1, but replacement with residues 215C359, 302C421, 2C168, or 2C86 failed to restore VLP production to wild-type levels. The results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct VLP assembly and release in SARS-CoV N is largely contained between residues 168 and 421.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein confers ability to efficiently produce virus-like particles when substituted for the human immunodeficiency virus nucleocapsid domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers the curious case of human behavior in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.

Emergency nurses constitute the first line of treatment in healthcare facilities when catastrophic events bring disaster victims in need of medical attention. Therefore, these nurses must be well educated and trained efficiently to be able to deal with disastrous situations properly. This study aimed to distinguish the most important elements of education and training for preparing emergency nurses to face disasters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), specifically, the city of Taif. Methods: This study employed a tool to measure nurses most important training and education needs that was created by the authors based on a literature review and was approved by an expert panel in disaster nursing. Questionnaires were distributed to emergency nurses in four hospitals run by the Ministry of Health in Taif city. Survey responses were received from 210 participants, and the data were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA). A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups according to their experiences. Results: The following three factors were extracted from the data after redundant items were loaded and excluded: incident management systems (IMSs), disaster triage, and disaster drills. Nurses with less than three years of experience have a significant need to learn about these elements in order to be able to cope with disasters. Conclusion: Understanding different types of disasters and how to deal with these catastrophic events is crucial. Significant differences existed between ED nurses in their understanding of the basic elements of disaster management based on their level of experience in an ED. Therefore, disaster education must be included in nursing curricula, and more training courses, mock drills, and simulations must be conducted in hospitals for nurses, especially nurses with less experience, so they can learn to manage their responsibilities during disasters.","output":"Identify the Disaster Nursing Training and Education Needs for Nurses in Taif City, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to significant stressors and shifts in social life, yet social interactions experienced by people with trauma exposure during the COVID pandemic is largely unknown.

We aimed to describe prognostic factors for influenza-associated IA (IAA) and poor outcome and mortality in critically ill patients in Switzerland. All adults with confirmed influenza admitted to the ICU at two Swiss tertiary care centres during the 2017/2018 influenza season were retrospectively evaluated. IAA was defined by clinical, mycological and radiological criteria: a positive galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage or histopathological or cultural evidence in respiratory specimens of Aspergillus spp., any radiological infiltrate and a compatible clinical presentation. Poor outcome was defined as a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS), invasive ventilation for > 7 days or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Of 81 patients with influenza in the ICU, 9 (11%) were diagnosed with IAA. All patients with IAA had poor outcome compared to 26 (36%) patients without IAA (p < 0.001). Median ICU-LOS and mortality were 17 vs. 3 days (p < 0.01) and 3/9 (33%) vs. 13/72 (18%; p = 0.37) in patients with vs. without IAA, respectively. Patients with IAA had significantly longer durations of antibiotic therapy, vasoactive support and mechanical ventilation. Aspergillus was the most common respiratory co-pathogen (9/40, 22%) followed by classical bacterial co-pathogens. IAA was not associated with classical risk factors. Aspergillus is a common superinfection in critically ill influenza patients associated with poor outcome and longer duration of organ supportive therapies. Given the absence of classical risk factors for aspergillosis, greater awareness is necessary, particularly in those requiring organ supportive therapies.

In adult therapeutic practice, there is research and clinical evidence to support the use of swallowing exercises to improve swallowing physiology in dysphagia; however, the use of these exercises in treating children with dysphagia is largely unexplored. Fundamental questions remain regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of using swallowing exercises with children. This review aims to outline the published literature on exercise-based treatment methods used in the rehabilitation of dysphagia secondary to an acquired brain injury across the lifespan. This will allow the range and effects of interventions utilised to be mapped alongside differential practices between adult and child populations to be formally documented, providing the potential for discussions with clinicians about which rehabilitative interventions might be appropriate for further trial in paediatrics. METHODS: This study will use a scoping review framework to identify and systematically review the existing literature using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) scoping review guidelines. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED)), grey literature and the reference lists of key texts including systematic reviews will be searched. Information about the rehabilitation design, dosage and intensity of exercise programmes used as well as demographic information such as the age of participants and aetiology of dysphagia will be extracted. The number of articles in each area and the type of data source will be presented in a written and visual format. Comparison between the literature in adult and child populations will be discussed.

We tested this hypothesis in patients with type 2 diabetes from the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events Italian Multicentre Study. METHODS: This observational, prospective, cohort study enrolled 15,773 patients with type 2 diabetes attending 19 Italian Diabetes Clinics in 2006-2008. Insulin sensitivity was assessed as estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), which was validated against the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Vital status on October 31, 2015, was retrieved for 15,656 patients (99.3%). Participants were stratified by eGDR tertiles from T1 (&#8805; 5.35 mg/kg/min) to T3 (&#8804; 4.14 mg/kg/min, highest IR). RESULTS: CVD risk profile was worse in T2 and T3 vs T1. eGDR tertiles were independently associated with micro- and macroalbuminuria and the albuminuric DKD phenotypes (albuminuria with preserved or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) as well as with eGFR categories or the nonalbuminuric DKD phenotype. Over a 7.4-year follow-up, unadjusted death rates and mortality risks increased progressively across eGDR tertiles, but remained significantly elevated after adjustment only in T3 vs T1 (age- and gender- adjusted death rate, 22.35 vs 16.74 per 1000 person-years, p < 0.0001, and hazard ratio [HR] adjusted for multiple confounders including DKD, 1.140 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.049-1.238], p = 0.002). However, eGDR was independently associated with mortality in participants with no DKD (adjusted HR, 1.214 [95% CI, 1.072-1.375], p = 0.002) and in those with nonalbuminuric DKD (1.276 [1.034-1.575], p = 0.023), but not in those with the albuminuric DKD phenotypes. Moreover, the association was stronger in males and in younger individuals and was observed in those without but not with prior CVD, though interaction was significant only for age. CONCLUSIONS: The proxy of insulin sensitivity eGDR predicts all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, independent of confounders including DKD. However, the impact of IR in individuals with albuminuric DKD may be mediated by its relationship with albuminuria.

Recently, additional data revealed that 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) perinatal exposure via lactation causes lasting behavioral and neuronal consequences (Scheyer et al., 2020a). Here, the long-term effects in adult offspring of maternal exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,12,2 are reported. The data demonstrate that rats exposed during lactation to WIN display social and motivational deficits at adulthood. These behavioral changes were paralleled by a specific loss of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) in the PFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc), while other forms of synaptic plasticity remained intact. Thus, similarly to THC, perinatal WIN exposure via lactation induces behavioral and synaptic abnormalities lasting into adulthood.","output":"Maternal Exposure to the Cannabinoid Agonist WIN 55,12,2 during Lactation Induces Lasting Behavioral and Synaptic Alterations in the Rat Adult Offspring of Both Sexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review of common gastrointestinal disorders of donkeys and mules is presented.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: By using the validated Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21, three hundred and twenty-five nurses practicing at the Sandeman Provincial Hospital, Quetta were approached for data collection. Through SPSS, both descriptive and inferential statistics were used during data analysis. Chi-square test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit between observed values and demographic variables. The factors that were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress were further assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. The statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Out of the 325 nurses, 297 participated in the study with a response rate of 91.3%. Mild depression and stress were reported in the current cohort of nurses (6.00  5.30 and 8.01  4.47), respectively. The mean anxiety score was 6.68  4.86 indicating moderate anxiety among the study respondents. Marital status, working department, and job experience were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress with moderate effect size (>0.3). The logistic regression reported department in which nurses were stationed (adjusted OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.118C1.415, p < 0.001) and job experience (adjusted OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.001C1.215, p = 0.002) as significant predictors of depression, anxiety and stress. Nurses working in the corona ward were more likely to develop depression, anxiety and stress by a factor of 2.54 and married nurses with a factor of 1.004 provided controlling other confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Moderate depression, anxiety, and stress were observed among nurses and it calls for hospital management to consider interventions for all nurses irrespective of their present working departments. Facilitating continuous and comprehensive support mechanisms aimed at protecting nurses mental health is of great importance during pandemics. The findings of the study have some clear suggestions for mental health advocacy among nurses that are essential for improving the quality of services and patients safety.","output":"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Nurses During the COVID-19 Wave III: Results of a Cross-Sectional Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most proposed algorithmic fairness techniques require access to data on a\\"sensitive attribute\\"or\\"protected category\\"(such as race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality) in order to make performance comparisons and standardizations across groups, however this data is largely unavailable in practice, hindering the widespread adoption of algorithmic fairness. Through this paper, we consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with smart enough technical methods and sufficient data alone. We show how these techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks associated with the sharing of sensitive attributes likely to be the target of fairness analysis, the possible harms stemming from miscategorizing and misrepresenting individuals in the data collection process, and the use of sensitive data beyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be part of a demographic group or to hold a certain identity, and ceding the ability to define for themselves what constitutes biased or unfair treatment. We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression.","output":"Demographic-Reliant Algorithmic Fairness: Characterizing the Risks of Demographic Data Collection in the Pursuit of Fairness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disinfection of surfaces in medical facilities is an important element of infection control, including the control of viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. RESULTS: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p < 0.001, ?2 partial = 0.08.

CASE REPORT: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID\\\\19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions before clinical stabilization. DISCUSSION: AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA; however, there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID\\\\19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID\\\\19 are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID\\\\19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID\\\\19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.","output":"COVID\\\\19 associated with severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, most countries have entered the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus epidemic. This sudden outbreak has caused a huge impact on the global economy, which has intensified the division of globalization and the recession of the global economy. Although the epidemic situation in China has gradually stabilized, the severe situation in the world still inevitably impacts China's economy. Based on the uncertainty of future epidemic, this paper sets up three scenarios to analyze the impact of the epidemic on China's economy. The first is that in June, the epidemic both at home and abroad is under control without rebound; the second is that the domestic epidemic is basically controlled but the foreign situation is not effectively controlled; the third is that the epidemic situation in China has a serious rebound due to the influence of the imported cases from abroad, which destroy the economy again. At the same time, some corresponding guidelines are put forward for the recovery of economy, and to minimize the economic losses as well as accelerate the pace of national economic recovery. In addition, it is believed that these suggestions may have certain reference value to other countries.","output":"COVID-19: Short-Term Influence on China's Economy Considering Different Scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First responders and other public safety personnel (PSP) experience elevated rates of mental disorders and face unique barriers to care. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) is an effective and accessible treatment that has demonstrated good treatment outcomes when tailored specifically for PSP. However, little is known about how PSP come to seek ICBT. A deeper understanding of why PSP seek ICBT can inform efforts to tailor and disseminate ICBT and other treatments to PSP. The present study was designed to (1) explore the demographic and clinical characteristics, motivations, and past treatments of PSP seeking ICBT, (2) learn how PSP first learned about ICBT, and (3) understand how PSP perceive ICBT. To address these objectives, we examined responses to online screening questionnaires among PSP (N = 259) who signed up for an ICBT program tailored for PSP. The results indicate that most of our sample experienced clinically significant symptoms of multiple mental disorders, had received prior mental disorder diagnoses and treatments, heard about ICBT from a work-related source, reported positive perceptions of ICBT, and sought ICBT to learn skills to manage their own symptoms of mental disorders. The insights gleaned through this study have important implications for ICBT researchers and others involved in the development, delivery, evaluation, and funding of mental healthcare services for PSP.","output":"Why Do Public Safety Personnel Seek Tailored Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy?

We examined factors associated with final malignant pathology and evaluated the postoperative course of patients with DA versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients with DA who underwent PD from 2008 to 2018 and assessed the accuracy rate of preoperative biopsy and factors associated with final malignant pathology. Complications for DA patients were compared with those of matched PDAC patients. RESULTS Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent PD for DA were identified, and the preoperative biopsy false negative rate was 29. Factors associated with final malignant pathology included age over 70 years, preoperative biliary obstruction, and common bile duct diameter > 8 mm (p < 0.05). Compared with patients with PDAC (n = 302), DA patients experienced more major complications (31% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), more grade C postoperative pancreatic fistulas (9% vs. 1%, p < 0.01), and greater mortality (7% vs. 2%, p < 0.05). Propensity score matched patients with DA had more major complications following PD (32% vs. 12%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative biopsy of duodenal adenomas is associated with a high false-negative rate for malignancy, and PD for DA is associated with higher complication rates than PD for PDAC. These results aid discussion among patients and surgeons who are considering observation versus PD for DA, especially in younger patients without biliary obstruction, who are less likely to harbor malignancy.","output":"Relationship between Cancer Diagnosis and Complications Following Pancreatoduodenectomy for Duodenal Adenoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A rapid and specific real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) was developed to detect the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in this study.

The amplification was performed at 40 C for 20 min. The assay could only detect the TGEV, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens tested. Using the in vitro transcribed TGEV RNA as template, the limit of detection of the developed RT-RPA was 100 copies per reaction. The assay performance was evaluated by testing 76 clinical samples by RT-RPA and a real-time RT-PCR. Fourteen samples were TGEV RNA positive in RT-RPA (18.4%, 14/76), which were also positive in the real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement between the two assays was 100% (76/76). The R(2) value of RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 0.959 by linear regression analysis.

Surfactant protein SP-D, member of the front-line immune defense of the lungs, binds glycosylated structures on invading pathogens such as viruses to induce their clearance from the lungs. The objective of this study is to measure the pulmonary SP-D levels in COVID-19 patients and demonstrate the activity of SP-D against SARS-CoV-2, opening the possibility of using SP-D as potential therapy for COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary SP-D concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by anti-SP-D ELISA. Binding assays were performed by ELISAs. Protein bridge and aggregation assays were performed by gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining and band densitometry. Viral replication was evaluated in vitro using epithelial Caco-2 cells. Results indicate that COVID-19 patients (n = 12) show decreased pulmonary levels of SP-D (median = 68.9 ng/mL) when compared to levels reported for healthy controls in literature. Binding assays demonstrate that SP-D binds the SARS-CoV-2 glycosylated spike-(S)-protein of different emerging clinical variants. Binding induces the formation of protein bridges, the critical step of viral aggregation to facilitate its clearance. SP-D inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in Caco-2 cells (EC(90) = 3.7 g/mL). Therefore, SP-D recognizes and binds to the spike-(S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, initiates the aggregation, and inhibits viral replication in cells. Combined with the low levels of SP-D observed in COVID-19 patients, these results suggest that SP-D is important in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and that rhSP-D supplementation has the potential to be a novel class of anti-viral that will target SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Full-Length Recombinant hSP-D Binds and Inhibits SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past two decades there has been a number of global outbreaks of viral diseases. This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally and between regions. Towards this we have devised a model of geographical spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells, in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland and found that the model is capable of reproducing and predicting the stochastic global path of the pandemic.

Unprecedented levels of stress contribute to physician burnout, leaves of absence and early retirement. Although recommendations have been made, we continue to struggle with addressing stress. One challenge is a lack of a shared definition for what we mean by 'stress', which is a complex and idiosyncratic phenomenon that may be examined from a myriad of angles. As such, research on stress has traditionally taken a reductionist approach, parsing out one aspect to investigate, such as stress physiology. In the medical domain, we have traditionally underappreciated other dimensions of stress, including emotion and the role of the environmental and sociocultural context in which providers are embedded. Taking a complementary, holistic approach to stress and focusing on the composite, subjective individual experience may provide a deeper understanding of the phenomenon and help to illuminate paths towards wellness. In this review article, we first examine contributions from unidimensional approaches to stress, and then outline a complementary, integrated approach. We describe how complex phenomena have been tackled in other domains and discuss how holistic theory and the humanities may help in studying and addressing physician stress, with the ultimate goal of improving physician well-being and consequently patient care.","output":"Pulling our lens backwards to move forward: an integrated approach to physician distress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, Indigenous Peoples experience disparate COVID-19 outcomes. This paper presents case studies from Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States of America and explores aspects of government policies, public health actions, and Indigenous nursing leadership for Indigenous communities during a pandemic. Government under-performance in establishing Indigenous-specific plans and resources, burdened those countries with higher COVID-19 cases and mortality rates. First, availability of quality data is an essential element of any public health strategy, and involves disaggregated, ethnic-specific data on Indigenous COVID-19 cases, mortality rates, and vaccination rates. When data is unavailable, Indigenous Peoples are rendered invisible. Data sovereignty principles must be utilised to ensure that there is Indigenous ownership and protections of these data. Second, out of necessity, Indigenous communities expressed their self-determination by uniting to protect their Peoples and providing holistic and culturally meaningful care, gathering quality data and advocating. Indigenous leaders used an equity lens that informed national, state, regional, and community-level decisions relating to their Peoples. Third, at the forefront of the pandemic, Indigenous nursing leadership served as a trusted presence within Indigenous communities. Indigenous nurses often led advocacy, COVID-19 testing, nursing care, and vaccination efforts in various settings and communities. Indigenous nurses performed vital roles in a global strategy to reduce Indigenous health inequities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Fourth, historically, pandemics have heightened Indigenous Peoples' vulnerability. COVID-19 amplified Indigenous health inequities, underscoring the importance of high-trust relationships with Indigenous communities to enable rapid government support and resources. Holistic approaches to COVID-19 responses by Indigenous peoples must consider the wider determinants of wellbeing including food and housing security. Findings from these case studies, demonstrate that Indigenous self-determination, data sovereignty, holistic approaches to pandemic responses alongside with Governmental policies, resources should inform vaccination strategies and future pandemic readiness plans. Finally, in any pandemic of COVID-19-scale, Indigenous nurses' leadership and experience must be leveraged for a calm, trusted and efficient response.","output":"COVID-19 among Indigenous communities: Case studies on Indigenous nursing responses in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guidelines from the CDC and the WHO recommend the wearing of face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the protective efficiency of such masks against airborne transmission of infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) droplets/aerosols is unknown.

Instead, they gave out less gifts and remittances themselves, lent less money to others and postponed loan repayments. Moreover, they significantly reduced expenditures on schooling and transportation, related to the school closures and travel restrictions.

Correlation was assessed between health determinants and the race-stratified COVID-19 crude mortality rate and infection-fatality ratio computed from respective state public health departments in 47 states. Results: Blacks had a higher prevalence of comorbidities (63.3%; 95% CI, 62.4% to 64.2% vs 55.1%; 95% CI, 54.7% to 55.5%) and adverse socioeconomic factors (47.0%; 95% CI, 46.0% to 47.9% vs 30.9%; 95% CI, 30.6% to 31.3%) than did whites. The prevalence of preexisting medical conditions was similar in blacks (30.4%; 95% CI, 28.8% to 32.1%) and whites (30.8%; 95% CI, 30.2% to 31.4%).

Comorbidities and adverse socioeconomic factors were highest in the southern region, and poor health behaviors were highest in the western region. The cumulative incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) was 3-fold higher in blacks (1546.4) than in whites (540.4). The crude mortality rate (per 100,000 persons) was 2-fold higher in blacks (83.2) than in whites (33.2).

METHODS: Retrospective study in two hospitals in the city of Crdoba, Argentina, with patients aged 18 years or more, hospitalized for active SARS-CoV-2 infection, from March to October, 2020. RESULTS: 448 patients were included, of which 95.75% corresponded to COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the episodes occurred in men (63.6%), the median age was 63 years (IQR: 53-75), and the most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension (55.1%), obesity (31.7%) and diabetes mellitus (28.1%). 162 patients (36.2%) needed admission to the intensive care unit and 66 (14.7%) were placed on mechanical ventilation. 67 patients(15%) died within the first 30 days of follow-up. In the multivariate analysis, the only independent variable predictive of mortality at 30 days was age (adjusted Odds ratio [aOR] = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04-1.11, p <0.001). The 4C-Score and CALL-Score prognostic scores showed good discrimination (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.766, 95% CI = 0.72-0.80 and AUC = 0.785, 95% CI = 0.70-0.85 respectively) and the predicted percentages of mortality were quite close to what was observed in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection presented comorbidities and were admitted with pneumonia, associated with high mortality. The prognostic scores with the best performance to predict complications were the 4C-score and the CALL-score.","output":"Caractersticas clnicas y epidemiolgicas de pacientes hospitalizados por infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en dos hospitales en Crdoba Infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 en pacientes hospitalizados"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: First case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 and within a timespan of few months, it has become a pandemic. It has created havoc globally and India is no exception. Globally, it is emphasized that preventive measures play an important role in controlling the rapid spread of COVID-19. In India, 68% of population is rural and this population is going to play a crucial role in the containment of the pandemic. Realizing the key position of rural population in COVID control, this study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of rural population about the disease. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on patients and their relatives from 1(st) April, 2020 to 31(st) May, 2020. A total of 372 participants hailing from rural areas were enrolled. RESULTS: Most common source of information for the participants was through television (54.8%) and radio (49.2%). Only 77% claimed that they were using face mask and 72% claimed to be following social distancing. A large (60%) proportion of the participants did not know that COVID-19 could spread from asymptomatic patients. Education of participants was a key determinant for use of social distancing and face mask as a preventive tool. With increasing age, the practice of social distancing and the use of face mask were decreasing in our study. CONCLUSION: Television/Radio channels form an important source of information and need to be used more effectively to educate the people about the disease and create awareness about effective preventive measures. People need to be educated about the role of asymptomatic carriers in spreading the disease.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19: A cross-sectional study among rural population in a northern Indian District"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on dry-eye symptoms in a community-based population, a cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.

We found a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and increase in adipose tissue thicknesses. This situation reveals the importance of vitamin D supplementation, the harms of weight gain and obesity, and the importance of a balanced diet. PURPOSE: Although the relationship between vitamin D (VitD) levels with body composition and physical/cognitive functions have been investigated in various studies, however, there is no study evaluating all these parameters together. In accordance with, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between VitD deficiency with body composition (i.e., skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle thicknesses) and physical/cognitive functions. METHODS: A total of 203 adults (78 M, 125 F, aged 19C91 years) who had recent 25-OH-vitamin D measurements were included. Ultrasonographic (US) measurements (skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle thicknesses) were made from the dorsum of the hand, and anterior sides of forearm, arm, and thigh. Handgrip strength, gait speed, Timed Up and Go Test, and Chair Stand Test were evaluated. Additionally, cognitive status was also evaluated with Mini-Mental State Exam. RESULTS: Subjects were classified as VitD deficient group (< 20 ng/ml, N = 125) and control group ( 20 ng/ml, N = 78). The groups were not significantly different as regards age, gender, and anthropometric measurements (all p > 0.05). Subcutaneous fat tissues were thicker in the VitD deficient group (all p < 0.05). All the other US measurements and functional/cognitive tests were not significantly different between the groups (all p > 0.05). According to linear regression analyses, body mass index (BMI) was independently related with all subcutaneous fat thicknesses in both genders, and VitD deficiency was related with all subcutaneous fat thicknesses in females and anterior forearm subcutaneous fat thickness in males (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We imply that together with BMI, VitD deficiency is independently related with increased regional subcutaneous fat tissue.

We hypothesized that possible changes in anxiety status might affect blood pressure in haemodialysis (HD) patients during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Seventy one prevalent HD patients were included in this prospective study. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were applied to assess psychological status of the patients. Peridialysis blood pressure measurements were performed and average of 6 consecutive HD sessions pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure measurements were used for statistical analyses. All assessments were performed both at the beginning (March) and after ending (June) of the partial lock-down, which was officially instituted by the Government in parallel with the status of the pandemic in Turkey. RESULTS: Mean age (SD) was 59.214.8 years and 52% of the patients were female. Dose of medications including antihypertensives, dry weight, interdialytic weight gain, and Kt/Vurea were stable during the study period. STAI-state score was higher in March than that in June (44.612.6 vs 42.311.5, respectively, p=0.047), whereas HADS-anxiety, HADS-depression, and STAI-trait scores were not different. Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in March than in June (127.920.3 vs 124.822.8 mmHg, respectively, p=0.029). Change in state anxiety score from March to June was remarkable particularly in patients not taking a beta-blocker (49.39.6 to 43.811.1, p=0.001) and in patients younger than the median age of 64 years (48.612.8 to 45.312.5, p=0.029).

Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records. Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1C5 for each lobe, range 0C20). Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation. The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8  12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24C80 years) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3C5 days). Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined. CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011). CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P < 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P < 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010).

In this setting, inpatient and outpatient services had to rethink and reorganize their activities to meet the needs of patients during the \\"lockdown\\". The Italian Association of Myology developed a survey to estimate the impact of these changes on patients affected by neuromuscular disorders and on specialized neuromuscular centers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed an electronic survey that was sent to neuromuscular centers affiliated with the Italian Association of Myology, assessing changes in pharmacological therapies provision, outpatient clinical and instrumental services, support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) and clinical trials. Results: 40% of surveyed neuromuscular centers reported a reduction in outpatient visit and examinations (44.5% of centers in Northern regions; 25% of centers in Central regions; 50% of centers in Southern regions). Twenty-two% of centers postponed in-hospital administration of therapies for neuromuscular diseases (23.4% in Northern regions; 13.0% in Central regions; 20% in Southern regions). Diagnostic and support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) were suspended in 57% of centers (66/43/44% in Northern, Central and Southern centers respectively) Overall, the most affected services were rehabilitative services and on-site outpatient visits, which were suspended in 93% of centers. Strategies adopted by neuromuscular centers to overcome these changes included maintaining urgent on-site visits, addressing patients to available services and promoting remote contact and telemedicine. Conclusions: Overall, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant disruption of clinical and support services for patients with neuromuscular diseases. Despite the efforts to provide telemedicine consults to patients, this option could be promoted and improved further. A close collaboration between the different neuromuscular centers and service providers as well as further implementation of telehealth platforms are necessary to ensure quality care to NMD patients in the near future and in case of recurrent pandemic waves.","output":"Estimating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on services provided by Italian Neuromuscular Centers: an Italian Association of Myology survey of the acute phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is a necessary first step for infection by enveloped viruses, and is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein. The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined class I glycoproteins adopt an -helical trimer- of-hairpins conformation during the fusion pathway. Here we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric -helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola Virus (EBOV) and Marburg Virus (MARV) GP2, despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH-dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the -helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in EBOV and MARV GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate Virus (GGV) support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that despite being primarily arenavirus-like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.","output":"Structural Characterization of the glycoprotein GP2 Core Domain from the CAS Virus, a Novel Arenavirus-like Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extraordinary COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most severe disruptions of human life since the end of World War II, even in rich and industrialized countries like Germany.

The question arises how life satisfaction is influenced by these measures in detail and whether there are interactions between institutional trust, life satisfaction and time of crisis. Fixed-effect regression analyses using German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) data demonstrate that life satisfaction has fallen sharply after the onset of the crisis and that interaction effects with institutional trust are present. Individuals with low levels of pre-crisis trust in institutions like the government, courts or the media report a stronger decrease of satisfaction than individuals with higher levels of trust.

This is reflected in trade flows but also affects the conditions for conducting dispersed production functions across countries. This \\"new normal\\" period presents the need to examine the main problems/challenges in international trade and business. Purpose: The article aims to establish the scope, aspects and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on international trade and on international production by reviewing recent articles which deal with international trade and global value chain (GVC) issues, changes that were already taking place and the challenges that began in 2020. Methods and approach: The findings of recent articles on trade flows and changes in GVCs (mainly the period 2019-2021) are described in theoretical terms, compared and systematically reviewed. Special focus is given to the impact of the pandemic on GVCs, re-nationalization and GVCs and the impact of the pandemic on GVC governance, and GVCs in the production of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus. Findings: Trade recorded a drop in 2020, accompanied with the introduction of protective trade policy measures. Reduced GVC activities had a negative impact on welfare and the \\"re-nationalization\\" of GVC-related activities is not a real solution. For the development of GVCs it is important to find a trade-off between efficiency and resilience, starting with re-organization (re-engineering) of GVCs, and probably focusing on regional frameworks. Liberal trade policies are essential to ensure the involvement of GVCs in producing the COVID-19 vaccines since the various inputs are produced in different countries. Policy implications: The possible directions for the future development of GVCs are elaborated: re-shoring, resilience in supply chains, adjustments in governance, diversification and development of risk-management strategies. The process of internationalization is not in question, but presents challenges which create the need for adjustments in its future development. Current problems with vaccine production arise in part from imposed trade barriers and rising nationalism. There is a need for greater cross-country co-operation to avoid placing national short-term interests before long-term and broader objectives.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic and internationalisation of production - A review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, pose considerable challenges for the management of oncology patients COVID-19 presents as a particularly severe respiratory and systemic infection in aging and immunosuppressed individuals, including patients with cancer Moreover, severe COVID-19 is linked to an inflammatory burst and lymphopenia, which may aggravate cancer prognosis Here we discuss why those with cancer are at higher risk of severe COVID-19, describe immune responses that confer protective or adverse reactions to this disease and indicate which antineoplastic therapies may either increase COVID-19 vulnerability or have a dual therapeutic effect on cancer and COVID-19","output":"The immuno-oncological challenge of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The European Union (EU) has adopted the Vision Zero and Safe System approach to eliminate deaths and serious traffic injuries on European roads by 2050. Detailed information on serious injuries, injury mechanisms and consequences are needed. The aim of this study was to describe and compare by injury mechanism the demographics, injuries, injury severity, and treatment of seriously injured road traffic trauma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed data on severe traffic injury trauma patients aged 16 years of the Helsinki Trauma Registry (HTR) covering the years 2009-2018. The variables analysed were basic patient demographics, injury mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes, injured body regions, patient Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) values, NISS groups (NISS 16-24 and NISS 25), AIS 3+ injuries, trauma bay and 30-day mortality, length of stay (LOS) at ICU and in hospital, surgeries performed, pre-injury classification, and intention of injury. RESULTS A total of 1 063 traffic injury patients were analysed; 38.6% were motor vehicle occupants, 28.5% motorcyclists or moped drivers, 17.2% bicyclists, and 15.7% pedestrians. The mean age of patients was 44.3 years (SD 20.2). Median ISS score was 22 and median NISS score was 27. Both scores were highest in pedestrians. Among all patients, total hospital LOS was 12 517 days (median 9) and total ICU LOS was 6 311 days (median 5). The most common AIS 3+ injuries according to ISS body regions were chest injuries (60%) and head or neck injuries (43.7%). Chest injuries occurred more frequently in motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants, whereas head or neck injuries were most common among bicyclists and pedestrians. CONCLUSIONS Severely injured pedestrians and bicyclists were older and they had higher mortality than motorcyclists and motor vehicle occupants. According to NISS, the overall severity was highest among pedestrians followed by bicyclists. However, the both median ICU LOS and hospital LOS were highest for pedestrians but lowest for bicyclists. The most common AIS 3+ injuries were chest and head or neck injuries. To specify effective injury prevention measures, hospital data should be complemented with information on the circumstances of the accident.","output":"Severe traffic injuries in the Helsinki Trauma Registry between 2009-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article takes a condensed look at the impact that SARS-CoV-2 has had on the work-life balance of women engineers across the world in industry, military and academia The same impact has been felt by all women, not only in science, as it is this gender status that inevitably ties women together, facing the same challenges, and cannot be separated by category of employment, or lack thereof Studies from around the world give us insight into how the pandemic has instigated changes and influenced choices made between work and domestic demands Globally, women are burdened with challenges that may compromise their progression in male-dominated fields, such as engineering Taking a glimpse at this issue for women through an international lens, we identify potential human factors methods to respond to this global problem, offering tools and forewarnings for improving our efforts in designing for, and maintaining equilibrium for women in engineering, technology, academia, and beyond ? 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","output":"A heuristic international glimpse at SARS-CoV-2 effects on work-home equilibrium and women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) exhibit escape from neutralizing antibodies, causing concern about vaccine effectiveness. However, while non-neutralizing cytotoxic functions of antibodies are associated with improved disease outcome and vaccine protection, Fc effector function escape from VOCs is poorly defined. Furthermore, whether VOCs trigger Fc functions with altered specificity, as has been reported for neutralization, is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Beta VOC partially evades Fc effector activity in individuals infected with the original (D614G) variant. However, not all functions are equivalently affected, suggesting differential targeting by antibodies mediating distinct Fc functions. Furthermore, Beta and Delta infection trigger responses with significantly improved Fc cross-reactivity against global VOCs compared to D614G-infected or Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals. This suggests that, as for neutralization, the infecting spike sequence impacts Fc effector function.

METHODS: A collection of carbapenemase-producing EB clinical isolates (n = 1242) was investigated by lateral flow immunoassay NG-Test CARBA-5 and molecular testing. Cefiderocol MICs were determined using broth microdilution Sensititre(TM) panel. MICs of CZA and MEV were determined by the gradient diffusion method. Antimicrobial synergy testing was performed using gradient diffusion strip crossing. RESULTS: KPC were the most frequent carbapenemases (83.2%), followed by VIM (9.2 %), OXA-48-like (4.3 %) and NDM enzymes (4.1%). Multi-carbapenemase producers were found in 10 (0.8%) isolates. Three combinations of two different carbapenemases were observed: KPC+VIM (n = 4), NDM+OXA-48-like (n = 4), and VIM+OXA-48-like (n = 2). CFDC showed potent activity against eight out of ten dual-carbapenemases producers, while resistance or reduced susceptibility was shown towards CZA and MEV.

Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil. RESULTS: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97 %), canine distemper virus (15 %) and canine adenovirus (27 %) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus. Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks. Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households. Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected. CONCLUSIONS: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dogs movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance. Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary.

The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM(2.5) show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 g/m(3) and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 g/m(3). As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown.

Since bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) collected during fibrobronchoscopy may increase test sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, it was performed during the 2020 pandemic in clinically or radiologically suspected cases. Our aim was to determine whether clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) findings or laboratory tests may predict patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study with multivariable analysis of suspected patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after at least one negative nasopharyngeal swab. Univariable logistic regression for odds ratio and multivariate models was calculated to determine clinical, radiological and laboratory predictors. 32/198 (16%) patients had BAL positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 65/198 tested positive for other pathogens at BAL. Of the 32 patients positive for COVID, 4 had a coinfection at BAL, being thus positive both for COVID as well as for another pathogen while the remaining 105 patients were negative for COVID and other pathogens at BAL. COVID-19 patients had more often highly suggestive CT findings, higher number of involved lobes, more often ground glass opacity of more than 50% of lung parenchyma, and less frequently other radiologically suspected infections. At multivariate model, temperature also predicted BAL positivity. The procedure was well tolerated-with only one desaturation episode-while no healthcare worker was infected. In conclusion, when nasopharyngeal swabs are negative but there is clinical or imaging suspicion of COVID-19, BAL represents a complementary diagnostic tool, particularly in conjunction with suggestive/more extensive lung involvement at CT scan. The procedure did not carry increased risks for patients nor for operators, while allowing to free hospital resources, avoiding unnecessary isolations.","output":"Bronchoalveolar lavage in suspected COVID-19 cases with a negative nasopharyngeal swab: a retrospective cross-sectional study in a high-impact Northern Italy area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of routinely recorded data for research purposes and disease surveillance is an attractive proposition. However, this requires that the validity and reliability of the data be evaluated for the purpose for which they are to be used. This manuscript reports an evaluation of milk shipment data for evaluating their usefulness in disease monitoring and the resilience of organic and conventional dairy herds in Sweden. A large number of inconsistencies were observed in the data, necessitating substantial efforts to clean the data. Given that the selection of rules used in the cleaning process was subjective in nature, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine if different cleaning routines produced substantially different results. Despite the cleaning efforts we observed far more large residuals at the shipment level than expected. Thus, it was concluded that the data were too noisy to be used for identification of short term impacts on milk production. Resilience was evaluated by examining the residual variance in milk shipped per cow per day under the assumption that herds with high resilience would have lower residual variance. The effects on residual variance of organic status or whether or not the herd used an automatic milking system were evaluated in models in which the residual variance was stratified or not by these factors. We did not find consistent evidence to suggest that organic herds had higher resilience than conventional herds, but this could be partly due to using residual variance as the measure indicating resilience.","output":"Exploring milk shipment data for their potential for disease monitoring and for assessing resilience in dairy farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ovine papillomaviruses (OaPVs) were detected and quantified, for the first time, using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) via blood samples of 165 clinically healthy sheep.

In addition, five OaPV1/OaPV4, four OaPV1/OaPV2, four OaPV2/OaPV3, four OaPV1/OaPV3, and three OaPV2/OaPV4 dual coinfections were also detected. OaPV coinfections by triple and quadruple genotypes were detected in 24 (~42.8%) and only one (~1.8%) of coinfected blood samples, respectively. Multiple infections caused by OaPV1/OaPV3/OaPV4 genotypes were the most prevalent, as observed in 12 (50%) blood samples harboring triple OaPV infections. This study showed that ddPCR is the most sensitive and accurate assay for OaPV detection and quantification thus outperforming real-time qPCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, ddPCR may represent the molecular diagnostic tool of choice, ultimately providing useful insights into OaPV molecular epidemiology and field surveillance.","output":"Molecular Epidemiology of Ovine Papillomavirus Infections Among Sheep in Southern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The SARS-COV 2 virus, which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, acts on the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor in the host cell. Ocular effects may occur because of the ACE-2 receptor in the retina. BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal layers and optic disc parameters in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: This study included 60 eyes of 60 subjects; 35 of them were in the COVID-19 group and the remaining 25 were in the control group. Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 that had a negative result after treatment were included in the study. Macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements, each retinal layer thickness of all participants were done 14-30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, following the negative result of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test using SD-OCT. RESULTS: The mean value of central macular thickness was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group (p = 0.02). The mean values of the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer thickness in the COVID-19 group were signicantly thinner than control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). Even though mean RNFL thickness measurements in all sections in the COVID-19 group was thinner than controls, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: In the early recovery phase, changes in the macula, ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer could be seen. These patients should be followed up closely for the recognition of new pathologies that could be seen in the late recovery phase.","output":"Quantitative assessment of retinal changes in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gay neighborhoods, like all neighborhoods, are in a state of continual change. The relevance of gay neighborhoodsoriginally formed to promote segregation of individuals who identify as sexual minoritiesis lately challenged by advances in technology, experiences with pandemics, shifts in generational opinion and social values, increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, and (in certain places) increased rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. This confluence of change has created for many people anxiety related to the belief that gay neighborhoods may be dissolving or even disappearing altogether. Seeking to address these concerns, this opening chapter of the book The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods: Renaissance and Resurgence presents eight important takeaway messages distilled from the chapters in this volume that, taken together, provide an in-depth overview of the formation, maturation, current challenges, and future prospects of LGBTQ+ spaces in urban environments. Findings suggest that shifts in patterns of residence, socialization, and entertainment for LGBTQ+ residents and visitors across metropolitan space have resulted in certain gay neighborhoods becoming less gay while other neighborhoods become more gay. In this time of social change, economic inequities, public health crises, and technological evolution, gay neighborhoods provide a culturally and historically significant template for communities in confronting adversity, fear, and discrimination. At this point in their maturity, gay neighborhoods have reached a plateau in their evolution; from here we pause to consider the current state of gay neighborhoodsand trajectories that might describe their future formas we contemplate the importance of gay neighborhoods in the ongoing advancement of LGBTQ+ people everywhere. We conclude by observing that while gayborhoods have experienced a certain level of de-gaying, the trend toward viewing gayborhoods as inclusive and gay-friendly places de-emphasizes the self-segregation aspects of gayborhoods that were important to their initial formation; consequently, while gay neighborhoods may become less gay, other neighborhoods may also become more gay.","output":"Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood?

METHODS: We designed the instruction using formative assessment in real-time online classes, developed the items of formative assessment, analyzed the items statistically, and investigated students' perceptions of formative assessment through a survey. RESULTS: It is designed to consist of 2C3 learning outcomes per hour of class and to conduct the formative assessment with 1C2 items after the lecture for each learning outcome. Formative assessment was 31 times in the physiology classes (total 48 hours) of three basic medicine integrated. There were nine knowledge items, 40 comprehension items, and 55 application items. There were 33 items (31.7%) with a correct rate of 80% or higher, which the instructor thought was appropriate. As a result of the survey on students perceptions of formative assessment, they answered that it was able to concentrate on the class and that it was helpful in achieving learning outcomes. CONCLUSION: The students focused during class because they had to take formative assessment immediately after the learning outcome lecture. Integration of lesson and assessments was maximized by solving the assessment items as well as through the instructors immediate explanation of answers. Through formative assessment, the students were able to utilize metacognition by learning what content they understood or did not understand.

The objective of this systematic literature review is to inform discussions about therapy choices for individual patients by summarizing the available evidence regarding the preferences of patients with chronic immune system disorders for intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration. METHODS: Searches of the MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were conducted using terms designed to capture studies reporting patient preferences between IV and SC therapy published in English. Relevant studies were limited to those in which mode of administration, including treatment frequency and setting, was the main difference between comparators. RESULTS: In total, 49 studies were included in the review. Among 18 studies that compared IV and SC immunoglobulin therapy, 16 found patients to prefer the SC administration route. The results of the 31 studies comparing IV infusion and SC injection of non-immunoglobulin therapies were mixed, with patients favoring SC administration in 20, IV infusion in seven, and having no overall preference in four. Patient experience had a strong effect on preferences, with treatment-experienced patients preferring their current administration route in most studies. Patients preferring SC administration tended also to prefer treatment at home, mainly due to the convenience and comfort of home treatment and the avoidance of having to attend hospital. By contrast, patients preferring IV infusion tended to cite the lower treatment frequency and a dislike of self-injecting, and preferred hospital treatment, mainly due to the presence of healthcare professionals and resulting feelings of safety. CONCLUSION: In general patients with chronic immune system disorders tend to be more likely to choose SC administration than IV infusion, but preferences may vary according among individuals.

Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and that individuals suffering from a concussion are more prone to experience additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, the most significant challenge in concussion management is the lack of objective, clinically- accepted, brain-based approaches for determining whether an athlete has suffered a concussion. Here, we report on our efforts to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between non-concussed and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only short (i.e. 90 s long) samples of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor expected to respond to a stimulus during data collection. The acquired EEG data were neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and validated using data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, benchmarked against 35 non-concussed adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of > 90% and achieved an ensemble median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC/AUC) equal to 0.971. This is the first instance of a high-performing classifier that relies only on easy-to-acquire resting state, raw EEG data.

The restrictions on gathering, social distancing and lockdown measures necessitated by the need to curtail its spread, had, and still have an enormous impact on the educational sector as indeed all spheres of life. These measures implied a change in the traditional modus operandi of curriculum and delivery options for educational institutions in South Africa in the bid to continue academic sessions. Hence, a transition of educational institutions from physical interactions to virtual meetings and the need to evolve curriculum contents and delivery. Aim: With the peculiarity of the South African socioeconomic and political space, this article assessed the viability of curriculum change and delivery options (e-teaching and learning) for both students and instructors in the higher institution and the varied implications. It drew from discourses around the theory of localisation within educative context to create a more student-centred approach especially with the situation of less physical contact. Setting: The discourse is set within the South African educational space. Method: Considering the novelty of Covid-19 research and the challenge of contact, the study adopted a participatory action desktop research method to collect and analyse secondary data. The article vividly discussed how institutions transitioned to a localisation of frameworks and policies to ensure successful academic sessions. Results: The educational landscape in South Africa is still plagued with historical antecedents of social injustice, funding, and resource allocation as well as the ever-present pressure of making education affordable to majority of local students. Also, the weakness of the online teaching methods to the physical contact method for learners and practitioners could be summed up into the issues of connectivity, technical knowledge, and attention span. Conclusion: The conclusion enumerated the need for the implementation of policies and frameworks on proper utilisation of online systems to adjust to the demands of less contact-based approaches in favour of virtual approaches.

It is our hypothesis that through a qualitative study via national focus groups with general surgery residents, common themes emerge surrounding their personal, clinical, and educational experiences that could be used to inform practice and policy for future pandemics and disasters. DESIGN: Six 90-minute focus groups were conducted by a trained qualitative researcher who elicited responses on six predetermined topics. De-identified transcripts and audio recordings were later analyzed by two independent researchers who organized responses to each topic into themes. SETTING: Focus groups were conducted virtually and anonymously. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents were recruited from across the country. Demographic information of potential participants was coded, and subjects were randomly selected to ensure a diverse group of participants. RESULTS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents clinical, educational, and personal experiences varied depending on the institutional response of the program and the burden of COVID-19 cases geographically. Many successes were identified: the use of telehealth and virtual didactics, an increased sense of camaraderie amongst residents, and flexibility in scheduling. Many challenges were also identified: uncertainty at work regarding personal protective equipment and scheduling, decreased case volume and educational opportunities, and emotional trauma and burnout associated with the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These data gathered from our qualitative study highlight a clear, urgent need for thoughtful institutional planning and policies for the remainder of this and future pandemics. Residency programs must ensure a balanced training program for surgical residents as they attempt to master the skills of their craft while also serving as employed health care providers in a pandemic.

METHODS: This systematic review was undertaken to identify studies presenting population-based estimates of need and coverage for five APs (hearing aids, limb prostheses, wheelchairs, glasses and personal digital assistants) grouped by four functional domains (hearing, mobility, vision and cognition). RESULTS: Data including 656 AP access indicators were extracted from 207 studies, most of which (n=199, 96%) were cross-sectional, either collecting primary (n=167) or using secondary (n=32) data. There was considerable heterogeneity in assessment approaches used and how AP indicators were reported; over half (n=110) used a combination of clinical and self-reported assessment data. Of 35 studies reporting AP use out of all people with functional difficulty in the corresponding functional domains, the proportions ranged from 4.5% to 47.0% for hearing aids, from 0.9% to 17.6% for mobility devices, and from 0.1% to 86.6% for near and distance glasses. Studies reporting AP need indicators demonstrated >60% unmet need for each of the five APs in most settings. CONCLUSION: Variation in definitions of indicators of AP access have likely led to overestimates/underestimates of need and coverage, particularly, where the relationship between functioning difficulty and the need for an AP is complex.

However, little is known about the impact of ethnicity and household size on acquiring infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study, in Leicester (UK), of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 1st March and 28th April 2020. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic, clinical and temporal factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity before/after lockdown. FINDINGS: 971/4051 (24.0%) patients with suspected COVID-19 were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PCR positivity was more common amongst individuals from ethnic minortiy backgrounds than their White counterparts (White 20.0%, South Asian 37.5%, Black 36.1%, Other 32.2%; p<0.001 for all ethnic minority groups vs White). After adjustment, compared to White ethnicity, South Asian (aOR 2.44 95%CI 2.01, 2.97), Black (aOR 2.56 95%CI 1.71, 3.84) and Other (aOR 2.53 95%CI 1.74, 3.70) ethnicities were more likely to test positive, as were those with a larger estimated household size (aOR 1.06 95%CI 1.02, 1.11). We saw increasing proportions of positive tests in the three weeks post-lockdown amongst the ethnic minority , but not the White, cohort. Estimated household size was associated with PCR positivity after, but not before, lockdown (aOR 1.10 95%CI 1.03, 1.16). INTERPRETATION: In individuals presenting with suspected COVID-19, those from ethnic minority communities and larger households had an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Pandemic control measures may have more rapid impact on slowing viral transmission amongst those of White ethnicity compared to ethnic minority groups, Research is urgently required to understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities and whether public health interventions have differential effects on individuals from ethnic minority groups.

Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 10 patients 60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported. Results: Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients C including the patients who presented with hypoxia C subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.","output":"Early outcomes after hip fracture surgery in COVID-19 patients in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Several diseases are linked to increased risk of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Our aim was to investigate whether depressive and anxiety symptoms predict subsequent risk of COVID-19, as has been shown for other respiratory infections. METHODS: We based our analysis on UK Biobank participants providing prospective data to estimate temporal association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and COVID-19. We estimated whether the magnitude of these symptoms predicts subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 in this sample. Further, we evaluated whether depressive and anxiety symptoms predicted (i) being tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and (ii) COVID-19 in those tested. RESULTS: Based on data from N = 135 102 participants, depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.052; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.017C1.086; absolute case risk: (moderately) severe depression: 493 per 100 000 v. minimal depression: 231 per 100 000) but not anxiety (OR = 1.009; 95% CI 0.97C1.047) predicted COVID-19. While depressive symptoms but not anxiety predicted (i) being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.039; 95% CI 1.029C1.05 and OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.978C1.002), (ii) neither predicted COVID-19 in those tested (OR = 1.015; 95% CI 0.981C1.05 and OR = 1.021; 95% CI 0.981C1.061). Results remained stable after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, multimorbidity and behavioural factors. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of multimorbidities. Potential underlying mechanisms to be elucidated include risk behaviour, symptom perception, healthcare use, testing likelihood, viral exposure, immune function and disease progress.

We investigated the effect of maintaining a sufentanil infusion during emergence from anesthesia by evaluating the incidence of cough and recovery profiles at extubation. METHODS In total, eighty-four patients undergoing an elective laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly divided into two sufentanil groups and a control group. During emergence, sufentanil was administered in the sufentanil groups at a rate of 0.2 g/kg/hr (Group S1) or 0.3 g/kg/hr (Group S2), and saline was administered to the control group. Cough score, hemodynamic changes, and recovery profiles, such as duration from skin closure to a bispectral index of 80, to eye opening at verbal command, to tracheal extubation and the total duration of study solution infusion, were recorded. The pain score, the total volume of administered patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) score were evaluated 1, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS Groups S1 and S2 showed significantly lower cough scores and smaller hemodynamic changes on extubation compared to Group C. Recovery profiles showed no significant differences among the three groups. Pain score, PONV at 1 hour postoperatively, and the total volume of PCA administered at all evaluation times were significantly lower in Groups S1 and S2 than in the control group. However, pain score, and PONV at 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS A sufentanil infusion (0.2-0.3 g/kg/hr) during emergence from desflurane anesthesia may suppress coughing on extubation in patients with body mass indexes (BMI) of 21-26 without delaying extubation time.

Evidence regarding cross-neutralizing response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. However, other previous coronaviruses may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they are phylogenetically related and share the same target receptor. Further, the seroconversion of IgM and IgG occurs at around 12 days post onset of symptoms and most patients have neutralizing titers on days 14-20, with great titer variability. Neutralizing antibodies correlate positively with age, male sex, and severity of the disease. Moreover, the use of convalescent plasma has shown controversial results in terms of safety and efficacy, and due to the variable immune response among individuals, measuring antibody titers before transfusion is mostly required.

CLT has intuitive applicability to workplace settings, yet how CLT should inform teaching, learning, and research in health professions workplaces is unclear. METHOD To map the existing literature, we performed a scoping review of studies involving cognitive load, mental effort and/or mental workload in professional workplace settings within and outside of the health professions. We included actual and simulated workplaces and workplace tasks. RESULT Searching eight databases, we identified 4571 citations, of which 116 met inclusion criteria. Studies were most often quantitative. Methods to measure cognitive load included psychometric, physiologic, and secondary task approaches. Few covariates of cognitive load or performance were studied. Overall cognitive load and intrinsic load were consistently negatively associated with the level of experience and performance. Studies consistently found distractions and other aspects of workplace environments as contributing to extraneous load. Studies outside the health professions documented similar findings to those within the health professions, supporting relevance of CLT to workplace learning. CONCLUSION The authors discuss implications for workplace teaching, curricular design, learning environment, and metacognition. To advance workplace learning, the authors suggest future CLT research should address higher-level questions and integrate other learning frameworks.","output":"Cognitive load theory for training health professionals in the workplace: A BEME review of studies among diverse professions: BEME Guide No. 53."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of tracheostomy has been significantly increased with the increase of patients admitted to the intensive care units.

Projections of demand for large-scale CDR are based on an integrated scenario framework for emission scenarios composed of emission profiles as well as alternative socio-economic development trends and social values consistent with them. The framework, however, was developed years before systematic reviews of CDR entered the literature. This primer provides an overview of the purposes of scenarios in climate-change research and how they are used. It also introduces the integrated scenario framework and why it came about.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes. CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in the lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is amantadine (10uM). Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson's disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Amantadine disrupts lysosomal gene expression; a hypothesis for COVID19 treatment "},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has pushed healthcare systems to the limit worldwide.

Methods The COVID-19 ICU Remote-Learning Course (CIRLC) is a remote delivery course developed in response to the pandemic. This was a one-day course focused on the fundamentals of Intensive Care. The course used blended learning with recorded lectures and interactive tutorials delivered by shielding and frontline ICU trained professionals. The course was developed within one week and piloted at three NHS Trusts. It was then made publicly available free of charge to redeployed healthcare professionals across the UK and Ireland. An iterative cycle of improvement was used to update the course content weekly. A course confidence questionnaire with quantitative and qualitative questions was used to evaluate effectiveness. Data is reported as n (%), means (SD) and thematic analysis was used for the open questions. Results 1,269 candidates from 171 organisations completed the course, with 99 volunteer trainers. 96% of respondents rated the course as very or extremely useful. 86% rated the online platform as excellent. Overall confidence improved from 2.7/5 to 3.9/5. Qualitative data showed that the course was pitched at the appropriate level, accessible and built clinicians confidence to work in intensive care.

In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model (ULNet) to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. The proposed architecture is constructed by adding a new downsampling side, skip connections and fully connected layers on the basis of U-net.

The aim of study is to investigate the mental health status of pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19, and analyze factors affecting the mental health status of pregnant women. Methods: Using a self-designed questionnaire, self-rated anxiety scale(SAS), self-rated depression scale (SDS), we conducted a web-based survey on 1160 pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19. Results: Compared with general adults in some regions of China, the scores of SAS and SDS were both significantly higher in pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). The results of multivariate regression analysis unveiled that age, levels of education, and duration of pregnancy were all factors influencing pregnant womens psychological status. In terms of psychological problems, compared with pregnant women aged < 30 years old, the risk of psychological problems in pregnant women aged  30 years old was 0.646 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.486C0.858). Moreover, compared with women with a level of high school or below, the risk of psychological abnormalities in women with a level of junior college degree or above was 0.551 times (95% CI: 0.416C0.731).

A lack of head-to-head clinical trials comparing these treatments means that there is uncertainty regarding their use in clinical practice. Objective To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of first-line systemic treatments for mRCC with a focus on IO-based combinations. Evidence acquisition MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and abstracts of recent major scientific meetings were searched to identify the most up-to-date phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of first-line IO-based combinations for mRCC up to June 2021. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were completed using the Bayesian framework. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), treatment-related drug discontinuation (TRDD), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The analysis was performed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population as well as by clinical risk group. Evidence synthesis A total of six phase 3 RCTs were included involving a total of 5121 patients. Nivolumab plus cabozantinib (NIVO-CABO) had the highest likelihood of an OS benefit in the ITT population (surface under the cumulative ranking curve 82%). Avelumab plus axitinib (AVEL-AXI) had the highest likelihood of an OS benefit for patients with favorable risk (65%). Pembrolizumab plus AXI (PEMBRO-AXI) had the highest likelihood of an OS benefit for patients with intermediate risk (78%). PEMBRO plus lenvatinib (PEMBRO-LENV) had the highest likelihood of an OS benefit for patients with poor risk (89%). PEMBRO-LENV was associated with a superior PFS benefit across all risk groups (89-98%). Maximal ORR was achieved with PEMBRO-LENV (97%). The highest likelihood for CR was attained with NIVO plus ipilimumab (NIVO-IPI; 85%) and PEMBRO-LENV (83%). The highest grade 3-4 TRAE rate occurred with PEMBRO-LENV (95%) and NIVO-CABO (83%), but the latter was associated with the lowest TRDD rate (2%). By contrast, NIVO-IPI had the lowest grade 3-4 TRAE rate (6%) and the highest likelihood of TRDD (100%). HRQoL consistently favored NIVO-CABO (66-75%), PEMBRO-LENV (44-85%), and NIVO-IPI (65-93%) in comparison to the other treatments. Conclusions IO-TKI drug combinations are associated with consistent improvements in clinically relevant outcomes for all mRCC risk groups. This benefit may be at the cost of higher TRAE rates; however, lower TRDD rates suggest a manageable side-effect profile. Longer follow-up is required to determine if the benefits of IO-TKIs will be sustained and if they should be favored in the first-line treatment of mRCC. Patient summary Combination treatments based on immunotherapy agents continue to show meaningful benefits in the first-line treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Our review and network meta-analysis shows that immunotherapy combined with another class of agents called tyrosine kinase inhibitors is promising. However, longer follow-up is needed for this treatment strategy to clarify if the benefits are long-lasting.","output":"Efficacy and Safety of First-line Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first pandemic lockdown dramatically impacted many aspects of everyday life, including healthcare systems.

We aimed to analyse potential differences in the self-reported compliance and characteristics of contacts with a doctor/dietitian before and during the pandemic lockdown and the perception of access to special food and opinions on remote contacts between a particular group of respondents. All participants (n = 614) were asked to complete an online questionnaire that consisted of 31 questions on pandemic-related events and circumstances which may have directly or indirectly impacted health and treatment. The people who completed the survey were divided into three groups: parents of PKU children (n = 403), parents of PKU adults (n = 58) and PKU patients older than 16 years (n = 153). The differences among the three analysed groups were found in the number of contacts, the way of contacting a doctor/dietitian during the pandemic and satisfaction with remote contact. Caregivers of children with PKU reported better therapy compliance, more frequent contacts with specialists and more satisfaction with remote visits than adult patients. We also observed a relationship between satisfaction from remote contact and self-reported frequency of contacts with a doctor/dietitian, as well as a relationship between satisfaction from remote contact and recommended blood Phe levels reported by both patients and caregivers. Travel time exceeding three hours from the respondents location to their doctor was associated with higher odds of their recognition of remote contact as a method of PKU treatment only in the group of caregivers. In the caregiver groups, the reported worse access to low-Phe products during the lockdown was linked to the perceived difficulty of maintaining the diet. However, such a relationship was not found among patients.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Fifteen PICUs across the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 between March 14, 2020, and May 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Deidentified data collected as part of routine clinical care were analyzed. All children were diagnosed and staged for acute kidney injury based on the level of serum creatinine above the upper limit of reference interval values according to published guidance. Severe acute kidney injury was defined as stage 2/3 acute kidney injury. Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed to study the association between demographic data, clinical features, markers of inflammation and cardiac injury, and severe acute kidney injury. Over the study period, 116 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 were admitted to 15 United Kingdom PICUs. Any-stage acute kidney injury occurred in 48 of 116 patients (41.4%) and severe acute kidney injury in 32 of 116 (27.6%) patients, which was mostly evident at admission (24/32, 75%). In univariable analysis, body mass index, hyperferritinemia, high C-reactive protein, Pediatric Index of Mortality 3 score, vasoactive medication, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with severe acute kidney injury. In multivariable logistic regression, hyperferritinemia was associated with severe acute kidney injury (compared with nonsevere acute kidney injury; adjusted odds ratio 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.04). Severe acute kidney injury was associated with longer PICU stay (median 5 days [interquartile range, 4-7 d] vs 3 days [interquartile range, 1.5-5 d]; p < 0.001) and increased duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (median 4 days [interquartile range, 2-6 d] vs 2 days [interquartile range, 1-3 d]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute kidney injury occurred in just over a quarter of children admitted to United Kingdom PICUs with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.

Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that sepsis is a risk factor for the later development of dementia. We aimed to investigate whether intensive care-treated sepsis is an independent risk factor for a later diagnosis of dementia in a large cohort of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We identified adult patients admitted to an ICU in 2005 to 2015 and who survived without a dementia diagnosis 1 year after intensive care admission using the Swedish Intensive Care Registry, collecting data from all Swedish general ICUs. Comorbidity, the diagnosis of dementia and mortality, was retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Registry, the Swedish Dementia Registry, and the Cause of Death Registry. Sepsis during intensive care served as a covariate in an extended Cox model together with age, sex, and variables describing comorbidities and acute disease severity. RESULTS: One year after ICU admission 210,334 patients were alive and without a diagnosis of dementia; of these, 16,115 (7.7%) had a diagnosis of sepsis during intensive care. The median age of the cohort was 61 years (interquartile range, IQR 43-72). The patients were followed for up to 11 years (median 3.9 years, IQR 1.7-6.6). During the follow-up, 6312 (3%) patients were diagnosed with dementia. Dementia was more common in individuals diagnosed with sepsis during their ICU stay (log-rank p < 0.001), however diagnosis of sepsis during critical care was not an independent risk factor for a later dementia diagnosis in an extended Cox model: hazard ratio (HR) 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.11, p = 0.873). Renal replacement therapy and ventilator therapy during the ICU stay were protective. High age was a strong risk factor for later dementia, as was increasing severity of acute illness, although to a lesser extent. However, the severity of comorbidities and the length of ICU and hospital stay were not independent risk factors in the model. CONCLUSION: Although dementia is more common among patients treated with sepsis in the ICU, sepsis was not an independent risk factor for later dementia in the Swedish national critical care cohort.

The positive feedback that has been received in just a few weeks after its beginning, once again has motivated to emphasis the population screening, with real considerations on the possibility of expanding this program on a large scale.","output":"Preliminary Results of the Micro-Elimination Project of Hepatitis C in a Disadvantaged Town in South-West of Romania-Or?ova"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the levels of physical activity (PA) and sleep and to examine specific COVID-19 factors that may be associated with changes in PA and sleep among adults in Russia. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported their sleep patterns and problems, frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past 7 days. Access to an outdoor green space and fitness centres, use of online resources, adherence to self-isolation recommendations and other preventive measures from Ministry of Health were self-reported. RESULTS: The sample included 2432 participants from 62 regions, 83% of who were female. There was a significant decline in the number of days per week participants reported not getting enough sleep (3.21  2.44 to 2.86  2.57; P < 0.001); participants also reported an increase in the number of days per week they had trouble falling asleep (1.70  2.24 to 2.13  2.48; P < 0.001).

BACKGROUND: Disruption of care pathways during a public health crisis may prevent children from obtaining prompt assessment for surgical conditions. Progression of appendicitis to perforation is influenced by timeliness of presentation. In the context of state-mandated controls and public wariness of hospitals, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on perforated appendicitis in children. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an analysis of all children presenting to 3 hospital sites with acute appendicitis between March 1 and May 7, 2020, corresponding with the peak COVID-19 outbreak in the New York City region. Control variables were collected from the same institutions for the preceding 5 years. The primary outcome measure was appendiceal perforation. RESULTS: Fifty-five children presented with acute appendicitis over 10 weeks. Compared to a 5-year control cohort of 1291 patients, we observed a higher perforation rate (45% vs 27%, odds ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.85, P = 0.005) and longer mean duration of symptoms in children with perforations (71a??a??39 vs 47a??a??27a??h, P = 0.001) during the COVID-19 period. There were no differences in perforation rates (55% vs 59%, P = 0.99) or median length of stay (1.0 vs 3.0 days, P = 0.58) among children screening positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Children in the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated higher rates of perforated appendicitis compared to historical controls. Preoperative detection of SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with inferior outcomes. Although children likely avoid much of the morbidity directly linked to COVID-19, disruption to local healthcare delivery systems may negatively impact other aspects of pediatric surgical disease.","output":"Increase in Pediatric Perforated Appendicitis in the New York City Metropolitan Region at the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using a logistic model. The model uses a regression analysis based on the least-squares fitting.

The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has been reached, i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day.

The possible peak date and the total number of infections for different countries are predicted using the data available. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million. The model prediction of Brazil shows that the peak will reach on 5 July 2020 and total infections will be 3.2 million. The reported data of India show a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The total number of infections in India is estimated to be around 2.4 million by the model and the predicted peak date is 3 August 2020.

Such apps can be effective if people are willing to use them. Accordingly, many attempts are being made to motivate citizens to make use of the officially recommended apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to contribute to an understanding of the preconditions under which people are willing to use a COVID-19 contact tracing app (ie, their use intentions and use). To go beyond personal motives in favor of app use, it is important to take peoples social relationships into account, under the hypothesis that the more people identify with the beneficiaries of app use (ie, people living close by in their social environment) and with the source recommending the app (ie, members of the government), the more likely they will be to accept the officially recommended contact tracing app. METHODS: Before, right after, and 5 months after the official contact tracing app was launched in Germany, a total of 1044 people participated in three separate surveys. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses, examining the same model in all studies at these critical points in time. RESULTS: Across the three surveys, both identification with the beneficiaries (people living in their social environment) and with the source recommending the app (members of the government) predicted greater intention to use and use (installation) of the official contact tracing app. Trust in the source (members of the government) served as a mediator. Other types of identification (with people in Germany or people around the world) did not explain the observed results. The findings were highly consistent across the three surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Attempts to motivate people to use new health technology (or potentially new measures more generally) not only for their personal benefit but also for collective benefits should take the social context into account (ie, the social groups people belong to and identify with). The more important the beneficiaries and the sources of such measures are to peoples sense of the self, the more willing they will likely be to adhere to and support such measures.","output":"How Identification With the Social Environment and With the Government Guide the Use of the Official COVID-19 Contact Tracing App: Three Quantitative Survey Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We present a case of novel coronavirus disease\\\\2019 that underwent combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

For bacteriologists, the proteome of bacteria is much less complex than that of eukaryotic organisms. However, not all the different cell \\"compartments\\" are easily accessible, and the analysis of cell envelope proteins is particularly challenging. For the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, one of the main foodborne pathogen microorganisms, the study of surface proteins is crucial to better understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity, as well as adaptation/resistance to and persistence in hostile environments. The evolution of proteomic techniques, and particularly the possibility of separating and analyzing complex protein samples by off-gel (LC-MS/MS) versus in-gel (two-dimensional electrophoresis) approach, has opened the doors to new extraction and preparation methods to target the different subproteomes. Here, we describe three procedures to prepare and analyze intracellular, exocellular, and cell surface proteins: (1) the cell fractionation, based on cell broken and separation of protein subfractions by differential centrifugation; (2) the biotinylation, based on the labeling of cell surface proteins and their selective extraction; and (3) the enzymatic shaving by the action of trypsin on intact cells.

Therefore, it is urgent task for us to develop a specific drug as soon as possible, and attracting worldwide attention.

This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.Methods: We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays Results: Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was [] 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3% and specificity for 95.8%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p<0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p<0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels. Conclusion: Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and the safety of the ECL method for colorectal ESD. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all cases of colorectal ESDs (41 cases in total) performed from January 2017 to February 2019 in our institution. From January 2017 to August 2018, 27 of these cases were performed using conventional (non-ECL) ESDs, while from September 2018 onwards, the remaining 14 cases were performed using the ECL method. Retrospective comparison between the ECL group and the non-ECL group was conducted in terms of clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between two groups. Procedure time (median [range]) was significantly shorter in the ECL group than in the non-ECL group (66 [29-131] min vs 90 [30-410] min; P = 0.03). As for adverse events, no case of perforation occurred in the ECL group, whereas perforation was observed in 7.4% (2/27) cases in the non-ECL group (no significant difference).

The immunomodulatory role of anesthetic agents has been demonstrated in vitro; however, its clinical relevance is unclear. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare propofol and sevoflurane with respect to biomarkers of perioperative inflammation. The secondary aim was to correlate markers of inflammation with clinical measures of perioperative cognition. METHODS Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials examining perioperative inflammation after general anesthesia using propofol compared to sevoflurane. Inflammatory biomarkers investigated were interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The secondary outcome was incidence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Meta-analysis with metaregression was performed to determine the difference between propofol and sevoflurane. RESULTS Twenty-three studies were included with 1611 participants. Studies varied by surgery type, duration, and participant age. There was an increase in the mean inflammatory biomarker levels following surgery, with meta-analysis revealing no difference in effect between propofol and sevoflurane. Heterogeneity between studies was high, with surgery type, duration, and patient age contributing to the variance across studies. Only 5 studies examined postoperative cognitive outcomes; thus, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Nonetheless, of these 5 studies, 4 reported a reduced incidence of cognitive decline associated with propofol use. CONCLUSIONS Surgery induces an inflammatory response; however, the inflammatory response did not differ as a function of anesthetic technique. This absence of an effect suggests that patient and surgical variables may have a far more significant impact on the postoperative inflammatory responses than anesthetic technique. The majority of studies assessing perioperative cognition in older patients reported a benefit associated with the use of propofol; however, larger trials using homogenous outcomes are needed to demonstrate such an effect.","output":"Inflammatory Biomarker Levels After Propofol or Sevoflurane Anesthesia: A Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.","output":"Record-breaking wildfires in the world's largest continuous tropical wetland: Integrative fire management is urgently needed for both biodiversity and humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis still remains a big challenge in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) despite stellar advances made in the field of medicine. We can achieve better clinical outcomes in patients by diagnosing sepsis earlier. Procalcitonin (PCT), an inflammatory biomarker, has shown promising results in this regard. Therefore, this systematic review was done to assess the use of PCT in diagnosing and predicting severe outcomes in patients admitted to ICU and to assess if introducing PCT as a routine biochemical tool in hospitals would be helpful to achieve better clinical course in ICU patients. To identify relevant articles, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and references of included articles. Eligible studies were identified by two investigators independently and data were extracted. Original articles that evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum PCT levels in predicting sepsis, the severity of sepsis, and mortality among adult patients admitted to ICU were included in this study. A total of 2,063 citations were identified by the search, among which 10 studies (five prospective cohort, three retrospective cohort, one cross-sectional, and one case-control study) met the inclusion criteria. Most studies showed moderate-to-low risk of bias which was evaluated using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. All studies showed a positive correlation between initial PCT levels and detecting mortality resulting from sepsis, six studies found PCT helpful in detecting sepsis, and four studies evaluated the role of PCT in detecting severity in patients with sepsis. One study found area under the curve of serum PCT level for predicting 28-day mortality to be 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.94; p < 0.001) in adults and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92; p < 0.001) in the elderly having an optimal cut-off level of serum PCT of 0.2 ng/mL in both the adult and elderly groups, with a sensitivity of 81 and 75% and specificity of 81.7 and 80.4%, respectively. PCT has shown promising results in detecting sepsis and its clinical course. For early diagnosis and management of sepsis, severe sepsis, and mortality in patients admitted to the ICU for a more favorable clinical outcome, PCT can be used.","output":"The Advancement in Detecting Sepsis and Its Outcome: Usefulness of Procalcitonin in Diagnosing Sepsis and Predicting Fatal Outcomes in Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of January, the World Health Organization had declared COVID-19 a ?global health emergency ?","output":"COVID-19: A great disruptor?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sodium/glucose co\\\\transporter\\\\2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are widely prescribed in people with type 2 diabetes.

Here, we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in ~200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles influence clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations. Identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increase fertility and extend reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicates that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases risks of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms governing ovarian ageing, when they act across the life-course, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.","output":"Genetic insights into the biological mechanisms governing human ovarian ageing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Despite all of the impressive progress that has been made in the field of cancer therapy, cancer continues to devastate the lives of many. Recent efforts have focused on taking advantage of the patients immune system, modifying and employing it to attack cancer cells more efficiently. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are part of the armamentarium used for that purpose. In this review, we discuss the role of the immune system in the fight against cancer, the various strategies that are aimed at engaging the immune system, and how therapeutic cancer vaccines can be used as a self-standing strategy or as a means to leverage other immunotherapies to deliver more efficient results. We elaborate on the obstacles that are present, why immune therapies do not work equally well on all patients, and how vaccines can potentially play a role in improving cancer outcomes. ABSTRACT: Impressive progress has recently been made in the field of cancer immunotherapy with the adoptive transfer of T cells, a successful personalized strategy, and checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) having extended the survival of numerous patients. However, not all patients have been able to benefit from these innovations. A key determinant of the responsiveness to cancer immunotherapies is the presence of T cells within the tumors. These tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are crucial in controlling tumor growth and their activity is being potentiated by immunotherapies. Although some epithelial cancers are associated with spontaneous T-cell and B-cell responses, which makes them good candidates for immunotherapies, it remains to create strategies that would promote lymphocyte infiltration and enable sustained immune responses in immune-resistant tumors. Therapeutic cancer vaccines hold the potential of being able to render cold, poorly infiltrated tumors into hot tumors that would be receptive to cellular immunotherapies. In this review, we elaborate on the obstacles that need to be overcome and the strategies that are being explored to that end, including various types of antigen repertoires and different vaccine platforms and combinations with other available treatments.","output":"Vaccines as Priming Tools for T Cell Therapy for Epithelial Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The effect of different routes of immunization with either live or killed bovine rotavirus (BRV) on the production of lactogenic antibody response in mice was evaluated. The routes of immunization were intramuscular (IM), oral (O) or intradermal in the mammary region (IMam). Following immunization, serum antibody responses were monitored by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following whelping, the mice were allowed to stay with their mother until sacrificed on alternate days post-parturition from day 1C11. Milk from their stomach was collected for antibody titration by ELISA and virus neutralization test. Regardless of the routes of immunization, a rapid increase in serum anti-rotavirus antibody titers was observed for the first 5 wk after immunization followed by a gradual decline. After parturition, the mean antibody titer of lacteal secretions, as determined by ELISA, increased gradually for 7 days with the greatest increase on day 9, followed by a decrease in anti-rotavirus antibody. These titers also correlated with antibody titers in milk as measured by virus neutralization test. The best lactogenic antibody response was observed when IMam  IM  2 route of immunization was used with live BRV as the antigen. Interestingly, immunization via the oral route with killed BRV also resulted in good antibody responses. In contrast, in the group where killed BRV was used, animals receiving 3 orally had the highest antibody titer. The distribution of different antibody subtypes in milk samples revealed IgG to be the predominant antibody followed by IgM and IgA. Irrespective of the route of administration, there was an increase in IgA on day 9 as compared to day 1 in most of the groups.

Nevertheless, at the beginning of the pandemic, there were restrictions and uncertainties in the use of health-related services. The following analysis examines the subjective perception of respondents with their healthcare provision whether there were sociodemographic differences. METHODS: Data from an online cross-sectional survey conducted between 29 April and 8 May 2020 were used (N = 1,570; 18-74 years). Bivariate test methods were used for analysis, stratified by age group, subjective social status (SSS) and chronic illness. The subjective perception was assessed via subjects' subjectively perceived worries, fears and difficulties of not receiving an adequate healthcare provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, an index was constructed with a range of values from 3 to 12 (Cronbach's  = 0.886). A higher index implies a poorer perception of the healthcare provision. RESULTS: Compared to the groups 50-59-year-olds and 60 years and older the 18-29-year-olds (MRank 431.1) had a significantly (p < 0.05) poorer perception of their healthcare provision during COVID-19. In addition, probands with low SSS were found to have a significantly (p < 0.05) worse perception (MRank 423.0) than subjects with medium SSS (MRank 374.1). Chronically ill subjects suffered significantly poorer perception (MRank 406.1; p < 0.05) compared to healthy subjects (MRank 366.0).

One of the most common pathways of species introduction is represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound. ABSTRACT: Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this population and investigated societal perception towards the llama presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire. Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms) research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020, the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze the attention of the general public. The decline of this population limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.","output":"From the Andes to the Apennines: Rise and Fall of a Free-Ranging Population of Feral Llamas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the knowledge of obtaining travel histories in medical students and interns.

We investigated the feasibility, acceptability and performance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging based diagnosis of uveitis. METHODS Observational cross-sectional study involving children with and without uveitis. Children underwent routine clinical examination and acquisition of anterior segment (AS) OCT scans images of intraocular inflammatory cells. Acceptability of image acquisition was assessed using a visual analogue scale, and duration of image acquisition. Inter and intra-observer variability of manual counting of acquired images (Bland-Altman limits of agreement), correlation between imaging and routine assessment, and sensitivity and specificity of AS-OCT detection of active inflammation were assessed. RESULTS Of 26 children aged 3yrs to 15yrs (median 8yrs) who underwent imaging, 12 had active inflammation. All patients rated acceptability of image acquisition as at least 85/10. Time taken to acquire images ranged from 15mins to 22mins (median 8mins). There was good positive correlation between clinical assessment and image based cell quantification (R2 =063, p=0002).

Background. Lack of life-long immunity against influenza viruses represents a major global health care problem with profound medical and economic consequences. A greater understanding of the broad-spectrum heterosubtypic neutralizing human antibody (BnAb) response to influenza should bring us closer toward a universal influenza vaccine. Methods. Serum samples obtained from 77 volunteers in an H5N1 vaccine study were analyzed for cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) against both subtype hemagglutinins (HAs) and a highly conserved pocket on the HA stem of Group 1 viruses. Cross-reactive Abs in commercial intravenous immunoglobulin were affinity purified using H5-coupled beads followed by step-wise monoclonal antibody competition or acid elution. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify cross-binding, and neutralization activity was determined with HA-pseudotyped viruses. Results. Prevaccination serum samples have detectable levels of heterosubtypic HA binding activity to both Group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses, including subtypes H5 and H7, respectively, to which study subjects had not been vaccinated. Two different populations of Broadly neutralizing Abs (BnAbs) were purified from intravenous immunoglobulin by H5 beads: 0.01% of total immunoglobulin G can bind to HAs from both Group 1 and 2 and neutralize H1N1 and H5N1 viruses; 0.001% is F10-like Abs directed against the HA stem pocket on Group 1 viruses. Conclusion. These datato our knowledge, for the first timequantitatively show the presence, albeit at low levels, of two populations of heterosubtypic BnAbs against influenza A in human serum. These observations warrant further investigation to determine their origin, host polymorphism(s) that may affect their expression levels and how to boost these BnAb responses by vaccination to reach sustainable protective levels.","output":"Wide Prevalence of Heterosubtypic Broadly Neutralizing Human Anti-Influenza A Antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Blood donor studies offer a unique opportunity to screen healthy populations for the presence of antibodies to emerging infections.

The antibody detection rate was adjusted to the population to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Ireland. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection rose significantly during the first peak of COVID-19 infection, increasing from 0.3% in March, to 2.9% in April (p<0.0001, The first SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive donor samples were collected on the 17(th) February 2020, 2 weeks prior to the first official notification.

We primarily sought to confirm the mechanical properties and cell compatibility of these ZnO NP infused scaffolds. Methods The antibacterial property of the ZnO NPs was confirmed by hydroxyl radical generation using ultraviolet (U.V.) photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known antibacterial compound, was used as a positive control (1% w/v) for the ZnO NP-based alginate constructs and their antibacterial efficacies compared. Among the ZnO group, 3D printed gels containing 0.5% and 1% w/v of ZnO were analyzed and compared with manually casted samples via SEM, swelling evaluation, and rheological analysis. Envisioning an in-vivo application for the 3D printed ZnO NP-based alginates, we studied their antibacterial properties by bacterial broth testing, cytocompatibility via live/dead assay, and moisture retention capabilities utilizing a humidity sensor. Results 3D printed constructs revealed significantly greater pore sizes and enhanced structural stability compared to manually casted samples. For all samples, the addition of ZnO or TiO2 resulted in significantly stiffer gels in comparison with the alginate control. Bacterial resistance testing on Staphylococcus epidermidis indicated the addition of ZnO NPs to the gels decreased bacterial growth when compared to the alginate only gels. Cell viability of STO-fibroblasts was not adversely affected by the addition of ZnO NPs to the alginate gels. Furthermore, the addition of increasing doses of ZnO NPs to the alginate demonstrated increased humidity retention in gels. Discussion The customization of 3D printed alginates containing antibacterial ZnO NPs leads to an alternative that allows accessible mobility of molecular exchange required for improving chronic wound healing. This scaffold can provide a cost-effective and durable antibacterial treatment option.","output":"Alginate Hydrogels with Embedded ZnO Nanoparticles for Wound Healing Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans account for 75 percent of new and emerging infectious diseases. Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them. These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development. To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed. In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden. The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats. To raise awareness of these challenges, which include biosafety and biosecurity issues, we held a workshop at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Biothreats conference to further discuss the topic with invited experts and audience participants.

RESULTS: A total of 25 617 cases were notified during the study period. Weekly cases and deaths peaked in mid-April 2020 at 5701 and 316, respectively. Mean number of close contacts per case was lowest at 0.7 in April, rising to 6.6 by July. Outbreak settings shifted from travel and workplace in March, to healthcare in April. Restrictions implemented on 12 March extended to full lockdown on 27 March. Phased relaxation of restrictions commenced 18 May. Effective suppression of community transmission of COVID-19 was achieved by June 2020. CONCLUSION: Lockdown is a crude population-level restriction effective in controlling COVID-19. Phased relaxation of restrictions in Ireland, however, led to an immediate increase in mean number of contacts per case, which facilitates viral transmission unless individual-level restrictions are adhered to.

The primary predictor variable was evaluation of OMF during a period with social distancing policies (2020 C experimental group) or without social distancing policies in place (2018 or 2019 C control group). The primary outcome variables were the facial fracture diagnosis, the abbreviated injury scale (AIS), injury severity score (ISS), and the mechanism of injury. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed, and the level of significance was set at p<0.05 for all tests. RESULTS: The number of subjects presenting with OMF was lower during the period of social distancing (n=235 in 2020) than during the periods without (2018: n=330; 2019: n=318). During the period of social distancing, there were more individuals who presented secondary to assault, whereas less individuals presented secondary to falls (p=0.05).

Synthetic biology holds great potential for artificially controlling their replication, a strategy that could be used to attenuate infectious viruses but is still in the exploratory stage. Herein, we used the genetic-code expansion technique to convert Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a model of RNA virus, into a controllable EV71 strain carrying the unnatural amino acid (UAA) N-2-azidoethyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (NAEK), which we termed an EV71-NAEK virus. EV71-NAEK could recapitulate an authentic NAEK time- and dose-dependent infection in vitro and in vivo, which could serve as a novel method to manipulate virulent viruses in conventional laboratories. We further validated the prophylactic effect of EV71-NAEK in two mouse models. In susceptible parent mice, vaccination with EV71-NAEK elicited a strong immune response and potentially protected their neonatal offspring from lethal challenge similar to that of commercial vaccines. Meanwhile, in transgenic mice harboring a PylRS-tRNAPyl pair, substantial elements of genetic-code expansion technology, EV71-NAEK evoked an adjustable neutralizing-antibody response in a strictly external NAEK dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that EV71-NAEK could be the basis of a feasible immunization program for populations with different levels of immunity. Moreover, we expanded the strategy to generate controllable coxsackieviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for conceptual verification. In combination, these results could underlie a competent strategy for attenuating viruses and priming the immune system via artificial control, which might be a promising direction for the development of amenable vaccine candidates and be broadly applied to other RNA viruses.","output":"Engineering RNA viruses with unnatural amino acid to evoke adjustable immune response in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide.

Methods: This observational and prospective study of COVID-19 patients was performed in eight Intensive Care Units (ICU) from Canary Islands (Spain). Serum levels of sFas and Bcl2 at ICU admission were determined. Mortality at 30 days was the end-point study. Results: Surviving patients (n = 42) compared to non-surviving (n = 11) had lower APACHE-II (p < 0.001), lower SOFA (p = 0.004), lower serum sFas levels (p = 0.001) and higher serum Bcl2 levels (p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed an association between high serum sFas levels and mortality after controlling for APACHE-II (OR = 1.004; 95% CI = 1.101C1.007; p = 0.01) or SOFA (OR = 1.003; 95% CI = 1.101C1.106; p = 0.004), and between low serum Bcl2 levels and mortality after controlling for APACHE-II (OR = 0.927; 95% CI = 0.873C0.984; p = 0.01) or SOFA (OR = 0.949; 95% CI = 0.913C0.987; p = 0.01).

We examined the prevalence of epithelial alterations, namely basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and spongiosis, among patients with inactive EoE (eosinophil counts below 15 following therapy) and aimed to determine whether maintenance of these changes in epithelial morphology are associated with persistent clinical findings. METHODS Esophageal biopsies of 243 patients (mean age, 16.9 years) undergoing routine endoscopy at the University of Pennsylvania were evaluated for epithelial BCH and spongiosis. Univariable analysis was used to calculate the association between epithelial changes and symptoms as well as endoscopic findings and peak eosinophil count. We validated our findings using data from a cohort of patients at the University of North Carolina. RESULTS The discovery and validation cohorts each included patients with inactive EoE, based on histologic factors, but ongoing BCH and spongiosis. Ongoing BCH, but not spongiosis, in patients with inactive EoE was associated with symptoms (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03-4.42; P=.041) and endoscopic findings (odds ratio, 7.10; 95% CI, 3.12-16.18; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with EoE, the presence of BCH might indicate ongoing disease activity, independent of eosinophil count.

We performed a test for anti-heparin/ platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies and functional assay using flow cytometry. METHOD: A healthy woman presented to the emergency department with chest pain, headache, and abdominal pain after the first vaccination with AstraZeneca. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed pulmonary artery embolism and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis. Abdominal CT demonstrated the thrombosis with occlusion in her right hepatic vein. Laboratory studies revealed decreased platelet counts, and high D-dimer level. Finally, laboratory results indicated high PF4 antibodies level high and a positive platelet activation test, confirming the diagnosis of VITT. RESULTS: Treatments including intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and direct oral anticoagulant were administered. The results of a follow-up platelet count and D-dimer were normal. In addition, the titer of PF4 antibodies (optical density: 0.425; normal  0.4, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) fell. After a 3-month follow-up, her general condition improved gradually.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 and similar after 70 years.

Thus, there is a race to find treatment alternatives. We contend that oral small molecule antivirals that halt SARSCoV- 2 infection are essential. Compared to currently available monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir, where parenteral administration is required, oral antivirals offer treatments in an outpatient setting with dissemination available on a larger scale.

Analysis of ABM dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to ABM analysis include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the ABM or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation (DE) models to predict the expected or averaged output from an ABM. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex ABMs may be infeasible, and coarse-grained DE models can fail to accurately describe ABM dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning (EQL) field provide promising novel approaches for ABM analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer DE models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from EQL can be used to learn DE models from ABM simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few ABM simulations, and accurately predicts ABM dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained DE models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two ABMs that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread.","output":"Learning differential equation models from stochastic agent-based model simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension and Diabetes are the most common comorbid conditions in patients with COVID-19 and has been shown to adversely impact prognosis globally.

Interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) was performed to assess whether major changes in outpatient attendance, malaria burden, and case management occurred after the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in rural Uganda. METHODS: Individual level data from all outpatient visits collected from April 2017 to March 2021 at 17 facilities were analysed. Outcomes included total outpatient visits, malaria cases, non-malarial visits, proportion of patients with suspected malaria, proportion of patients tested using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and proportion of malaria cases prescribed artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations and fractional regression was used to model count and proportion outcomes, respectively. Pre-COVID trends (April 2017-March 2020) were used to predict theexpected trend in the absence of COVID-19 introduction. Effects of COVID-19 were estimated over two six-month COVID-19 time periods (April 2020-September 2020 and October 2020CMarch 2021) by dividing observed values by expected values, and expressed as ratios. RESULTS: A total of 1,442,737 outpatient visits were recorded. Malaria was suspected in 55.3% of visits and 98.8% of these had a malaria diagnostic test performed. ITSA showed no differences between observed and expected total outpatient visits, malaria cases, non-malarial visits, or proportion of visits with suspected malaria after COVID-19 onset. However, in the second six months of the COVID-19 time period, there was a smaller mean proportion of patients tested with RDTs compared to expected (relative prevalence ratio (RPR) = 0.87, CI (0.78C0.97)) and a smaller mean proportion of malaria cases prescribed AL (RPR = 0.94, CI (0.90C0.99)). CONCLUSIONS: In the first year after the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Uganda, there were no major effects on malaria disease burden and indicators of case management at these 17 rural health facilities, except for a modest decrease in the proportion of RDTs used for malaria diagnosis and the mean proportion of malaria cases prescribed AL in the second half of the COVID-19 pandemic year.

We aimed to identify temporal subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 using a novel sequence cluster analysis and associate them with clinically relevant outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 1036 confirmed critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York city. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering method was used with Levenshtein distance and Ward's minimum variance linkage. RESULTS We identified four subphenotypes. Subphenotype I (N = 233 [22.5%]) included patients with rapid respirations and a rapid heartbeat but less need for invasive interventions within the first 24 hours, along with a relatively good prognosis. Subphenotype II (N = 418 [40.3%]) represented patients with the least degree of ailments, relatively low mortality, and the highest probability of discharge from the hospital. Subphenotype III (N = 259 [25.0%]) represented patients who experienced clinical deterioration during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission, leading to poor outcomes. Subphenotype IV (N = 126 [12.2%]) represented an acute respiratory distress syndrome trajectory with an almost universal need for mechanical ventilation.

Studies of mutagen-resistant viruses have identified determinants of replicative fidelity and the importance of mutation rate to viral population dynamics. We have previously demonstrated the effective lethal mutagenesis of influenza A virus using three nucleoside analogs as well as the viruss high genetic barrier to mutagen resistance. Here, we investigate the mutagen-resistant phenotypes of mutations that were enriched in drug-treated populations. We find that PB1 T123A has higher replicative fitness than the wild type, PR8, and maintains its level of genome production during 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine) treatment. Surprisingly, this mutagen-resistant variant also has an increased baseline rate of C-to-U and G-to-A mutations. A second drug-selected mutation, PA T97I, interacts epistatically with PB1 T123A to mediate high-level mutagen resistance, predominantly by limiting the inhibitory effect of nucleosides on polymerase activity. Consistent with the importance of epistatic interactions in the influenza virus polymerase, our data suggest that nucleoside analog resistance and replication fidelity are strain dependent. Two previously identified ribavirin {1-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide} resistance mutations, PB1 V43I and PB1 D27N, do not confer drug resistance in the PR8 background, and the PR8-PB1 V43I polymerase exhibits a normal baseline mutation rate. Our results highlight the genetic complexity of the influenza A virus polymerase and demonstrate that increased replicative capacity is a mechanism by which an RNA virus can counter the negative effects of elevated mutation rates. IMPORTANCE RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. This standing genetic diversity gives them the potential to adapt rapidly, evolve resistance to antiviral therapeutics, and evade immune responses. Viral mutants with altered mutation rates or mutational tolerance have provided insights into how genetic diversity arises and how it affects the behavior of RNA viruses. To this end, we identified variants within the polymerase complex of influenza virus that are able to tolerate drug-mediated increases in viral mutation rates. We find that drug resistance is highly dependent on interactions among mutations in the polymerase complex. In contrast to other viruses, influenza virus counters the effect of higher mutation rates primarily by maintaining high levels of genome replication. These findings suggest the importance of maintaining large population sizes for viruses with high mutation rates and show that multiple proteins can affect both mutation rate and genome synthesis.","output":"Epistatic Interactions within the Influenza A Virus Polymerase Complex Mediate Mutagen Resistance and Replication Fidelity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economic and social conditions have deteriorated worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. Migration theory and international organizations indicate that these increasingly fragile social conditions represent powerful incentives to migrate. Normally, studies addressing international migration and COVID-19 focus on transit and destination countries, with substantially less literature centered on origin nations. Trying to close that gap, the present article aims to identify and quantify economic determinants that explain the intention of Salvadorians to migrate abroad. Using a probabilistic sample and a logistic model, a number of renowned economic variables for migration studies were used to investigate Salvadorians intention to emigrate. Results demonstrated a stark reduction in migration intentions in 2020. Moreover, the risk of losing ones job is by far the most prominent factor explaining the intention to migrate. Other aspects, such as employment and salaries, also showed statistically significant values. Additionally, results report women being less likely to migrate and age to have a negligible effect. The text concludes by indicating some public initiatives that could be implemented to support people who choose to act upon their intentions and embark on emigration.","output":"Intention to Migrate Due to COVID-19: a Study for El Salvador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study represents an efficient preliminary protocol for in vitro mass production of two Paulownia species (Paulownia hybrid and Paulownia tomentosa) seedlings by using seed explant.

Here, we examine the capability of the booster vaccination to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and T-cell responses. MethodsA total of 167 participants primed with heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222 were enrolled to receive AZD1222, BNT162b2, or mRNA-1273 as a booster dose. Reactogenicity was recorded. Binding antibody, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against omicron BA.1 and BA.2, and total interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) post-booster responses were measured. ResultsA substantial loss in neutralizing potency to omicron variant was found at 4 to 5 months after receiving the heterologous CoronaVac/AZD1222. Following booster vaccination, a significant increase in binding antibodies and neutralizing activities toward delta and omicron variants was observed. Neutralization to omicron BA.1 and BA.2 were comparable, showing the highest titers after boosted mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2 and AZD1222.

During the last few decades NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy has emerged as an intriguing structural biology instrument in the antiviral drug discovery field. OBJECTIVE The review highlights how a variety of NMR-based tools can be employed to better understand viral machineries, develop anti-viral agents and set-up diagnostic and therapeutic routes. METHODS Works summarized herein were searched through PubMed database and the Web. RESULTS The review focuses on a subset of human viruses that have been largely studied through NMR techniques. Indeed, NMR solid- or solution-state methodologies allow to gain structural information on viral proteins and viral genomes either in isolation or bound to diverse binding partners. NMR data can be employed to set up structure-based approaches to design efficient antiviral agents inhibiting crucial steps of viral life cycle. In addition, NMR-based metabolomics analyses of biofluids from virus-infected patients let identify metabolites biomarkers of the disease and follow changes in metabolic profiles associated with antiviral therapy thus paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Although vaccinations have shown high efficacy, the emergence of novel variants of concern (VOCs) has already exhibited traits of immune evasion. Thus, the development of tailored antiviral medications for patients with incomplete, inefficient, or non-existent immunization, is essential. The attachment of viral surface proteins to the cell surface is the first crucial step in the viral replication cycle, which for SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the high affinity interaction of the viral trimeric spike with the host cell surface-located human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2). Here, we used a novel and efficient next generation sequencing (NGS) supported phage display strategy for the selection of a set of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)-targeting peptide ligands that bind to the target protein with low M to nM dissociation constants. Compound CVRBDL-3 inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein association to hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner for pre- as well as post-complex formation conditions. Further rational optimization yielded a CVRBDL-3 based divalent compound, which demonstrated inhibitory efficacy with an IC(50) value of 47 nM. The obtained compounds were not only efficient for the different spike constructs from the originally isolated wt SARS-CoV-2, but also for B.1.1.7 mutant trimeric spike protein. Our work demonstrates that phage display-derived peptide ligands are potential fusion inhibitors of viral cell entry.

Data from Baidus real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system were elicited to empirically examine the theoretical inferences. RESULTS: Populations migrating from Wuhan to other cities increased the initial number of latently infected cases in these cities, raising the number of confirmed cases. Hence, implementing social distancing between the susceptible and infected populations could effectively lower the number of infected cases. Using data from Baidus real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system, the empirical results revealed that an increase of 1000 persons migrating from Wuhan raised the number of confirmed cases by 4.82 persons.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis using the French national (Programme de mdicalisation des systmes dinformation) database. SETTING: Any public or private hospital in France. PARTICIPANTS: 98 366 patients admitted with COVID-19 for more than 1 day during the first semester of 2020 were included. The underlying conditions were retrieved for all contiguous stays. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and associated risk factors were assessed using frailty Cox models. RESULTS: Among the 98 366 patients included, 25 765 (26%) were admitted to a CCU. The median age was 66 (IQR: 55C76) years in CCUs and 74 (IQR: 57C85) years in HCUs. Age was the main risk factor of death in both CCUs and HCUs, with adjusted HRs (aHRs) in CCUs increasing from 1.60 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.88) for 46 to 65 years to 8.17 (95% CI 6.86 to 9.72) for 85 years. In HCUs, the aHR associated with age was more than two times higher. The gender was not significantly associated with death, aHR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, p=0.2693) in CCUs. Most of the underlying chronic conditions were risk factors for death, including malignant neoplasm (CCU: 1.34 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.43); HCU: 1.41 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.47)), cirrhosis without transplant (1.41 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.64); 1.27 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.45)) and dementia (1.30 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.46); 1.07 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.12)).

METHODS: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective cohort study enrolling up to 4700 children with CAP at EDs at ~80 member sites of the Pediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN; https://pern-global.com/). We will include children aged 3 months to <14 years with a clinical diagnosis of CAP. We will exclude children with hospital admissions within 7 days prior to the study visit, hospital-acquired pneumonias or chronic complex conditions. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data from the ED visit and hospitalisations within 7 days will be collected. A follow-up telephone or text survey will be completed 7C14 days after the visit. The primary outcome is a three-tier composite of disease severity. Ordinal logistic regression, assuming a partial proportional odds specification, and recursive partitioning will be used to develop the risk stratification models.

Both olmesartan and captopril significantly increased ace2 expression in the heart, gill, and kidney. Olmesartan also increased ace2 expression in the intestine. Conversely, aliskiren significantly decreased ace2 expression in the heart. Discontinuation of compound treatments for 7 days did not return ace2 expression to baseline levels. While potential risks or benefits of antihypertensive RAAS inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remain uncertain, this study provides new insights regarding the impact of RAAS inhibitors on organ-specific ace2 expression in another vertebrate model, thereby providing comparative data and laying scientific groundwork for future clinical decisions of RAAS inhibitor use in the context of COVID-19.","output":"The effect of reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system inhibitors on organ-specific ace2 expression in zebrafish and its implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The use of sedation in intensive care units (ICUs) is necessary and ubiquitous. The impact of sedation strategy on outcome, particularly when delivered early after initiation of mechanical ventilation, is unknown.

The mechanism of spread would arise through three mechanisms: inhalation of faecal and/or urinary aerosol from an individual shedding SARS-CoV-2; airborne transmission of respiratory aerosols between users face-to-face or during short periods after use; or from fomite transmission via frequent touch sites such as door handles, sink taps, lota or toilet roll dispenser. In this respect toilets could present a risk comparable with other high throughput enclosed spaces such as public transport and food retail outlets. They are often compact, inadequately ventilated, heavily used and subject to maintenance and cleaning issues. Factors such as these would compound the risks generated by toilet users incubating or symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, toilets are important public infrastructure since they are vital for the maintenance of accessible, sustainable and comfortable urban spaces. Given the lack of studies on transmission through use of public toilets, comprehensive risk assessment relies upon the compilation of evidence gathered from parallel studies, including work performed in hospitals and prior work on related viruses. This narrative review examines the evidence suggestive of transmission risk through use of public toilets and concludes that such a risk cannot be lightly disregarded. A range of mitigating actions are suggested for both users of public toilets and those that are responsible for their design, maintenance and management.","output":"What is the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 from the use of public toilets?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiologists, and doctors in general, need relevant information for the quantification and characterization of pulmonary structures damaged by severe diseases, such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We determined if the degree of patient satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes progressed with the equivalent treatment outcomes after the introduction of a single-incision approach to laparoscopic Heller-Dor surgery. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive esophageal achalasia patients (multiport approach, n = 10; single-incision approach, n = 10) and assessed the treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction with the aesthetic outcomes. RESULTS In the single-incision approach, thin supportive devices were routinely used to gain exposure to the esophageal hiatus. No statistically significant differences in the operating time (210.2  28.8 vs 223.5  46.3 min; P = 0.4503) or blood loss (14.0  31.7 vs 16.0  17.8 mL; P = 0.8637) were detected between the multiport and single-incision approaches. We experienced no intraoperative complications. Mild dysphagia, which resolved spontaneously, was noted postoperatively in one patient treated with the multiport approach. The reduction rate of the maximum lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 25.1  34.4% for the multiport approach and 21.8  19.2% for the single-incision approach (P = 0.8266). Patient satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes was greater for the single-incision approach than for the multiport approach.

Healthcare workers were on the front lines in response to this crisis; therefore, they were among the most affected by the pandemic. The study aims to assess the stress perceived by healthcare workers and possible factors contributing to it, hoping that more efforts will be exerted to support the well-being of healthcare workers during public health emergencies. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted. Data were collected from 118 healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Most of the respondents (75.2%) scored much higher stress levels than average, and 19.5% had slightly higher levels of stress. Most respondents were afraid of infecting their family and close ones (77.1 %), and about half of the respondents were afraid of getting infected (47.5%). Regression analysis revealed that the only significant independent variable predicting developing higher stress levels among the participants was assigning them to tasks outside their specialty. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at high risk of developing mental health problems during public health emergencies. Their well-being is essential for the quality of services they provide. More efforts are needed to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and to prepare them for such emergencies. Preparing healthcare workers before redeployment through training and providing PPEs will help to reduce the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their physical and mental health.","output":"Predictors of stress among a sample of Egyptian healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 in Hubei province China, is now the cause of a global pandemic present in over 150 countries.

In situations where a focal treatment option is desired, strong consideration should be given to percutaneous thermal ablation, in addition to surgery and radiation therapy. A significant advantage of percutaneous thermal ablation over surgery and radiation includes the repeatability of ablation, as there is no absolute limit on the number of times an ablation can be performed.

Our objective was to evaluate the propensity of a population of Italian women to receive the vaccine and its psychological impact. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was performed on pregnant women attending Ospedale Cristo Re Universit Roma TorVergata. A multi-section questionnaire was sent to each included woman on the first day of available SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Part-A was finalized to acquire maternal characteristics and to test the women's perception of vaccinations in pregnancy and their fear-induced by vaccines. Part-B included the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) a validated test for scoring trait anxiety (basal anxiety, STAI-T) and state anxiety (STAI-S). An abnormal value of STAI was considered when &#8805;40. Comparisons of maternal variables were performed according to their vaccine attitude. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 161 women (80.5% of the population considered). A positive attitude toward the vaccine was present in 136 (84.5%) women (positive) while the remaining 25.5% considered the vaccine not useful (negative). Among the former group 52.9% were favorable to obtain the vaccine during pregnancy despite the current national limitations, a percentage significantly higher (p = .02) than in the negative groups. Women with a negative attitude to the vaccine had a lower educational (p = .002) and employment level (p = .016) when compared to the positive group. In all the women a significant increase of STAI-S from STAI-T values was evidenced (p < .0001).

Human IFN- has polymorphisms that may cause differences in the interaction with the specific receptor in the human population. Interestingly, bovine IFN-3 has an in silico-predicted higher affinity for the human receptor than its human counterparts, with high identity with different human IFN- variants, making it a suitable antiviral therapeutic candidate for human health.

As socialbots undermine the ecosystem of social platforms, they are often considered harmful. As such, there have been several computational efforts to auto-detect the socialbots. However, to our best knowledge, the adversarial nature of these socialbots has not yet been studied. This begs a question\\"can adversaries, controlling socialbots, exploit AI techniques to their advantage?\\"To this question, we successfully demonstrate that indeed it is possible for adversaries to exploit computational learning mechanism such as reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize the influence of socialbots while avoiding being detected. We first formulate the adversarial socialbot learning as a cooperative game between two functional hierarchical RL agents. While one agent curates a sequence of activities that can avoid the detection, the other agent aims to maximize network influence by selectively connecting with right users. Our proposed policy networks train with a vast amount of synthetic graphs and generalize better than baselines on unseen real-life graphs both in terms of maximizing network influence (up to +18%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to +40% undetectability) under a strong bot detector (with 90% detection accuracy). During inference, the complexity of our approach scales linearly, independent of a network's structure and the virality of news. This makes our approach a practical adversarial attack when deployed in a real-life setting.","output":"Socialbots on Fire: Modeling Adversarial Behaviors of Socialbots via Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Several vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been licensed and are being administered worldwide in various countries. However, the awareness, behaviors, and expectations of COVID-19 vaccines among dental clinic patients are poorly understood. METHODS: An e-survey was carried out among 1800 patients who visited dental clinics in India. The survey was carried out using a questionnaire of four parts and informed consent (i.e. sociodemographics, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions). The investigators used Internet methods for data collection during the pandemic. RESULTS: The mean awareness score was significantly higher among participants who reported having a university/higher level of schooling, being in the upper socioeconomic status community, living in cities, and having previously received all required vaccines. The mean attitude score was slightly higher for participants who reported being female and had a history of getting all required vaccinations. Just over half (52%) of participants felt everyone should be vaccinated. This interpretation was slightly higher among females than males (56.9% vs. 47.9%, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that patients attending dental clinics in India have insufficient awareness but more optimistic attitudes about the COVID-19 vaccine. Immediate health promotion campaigns must be implemented before vaccine schedules in order to increase awareness.","output":"Awareness, Views, and Expectations about COVID-19 Vaccinations: A Cross-Sectional Study of Dental Clinic Patients in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has revealed inequalities between men and women and has deepened some existing disparities.

Emerging evidence supports that energy metabolism is affected in ME/CFS, but a unifying metabolic phenotype has not been firmly established. We performed global metabolomics, lipidomics, and hormone measurements, and we used exploratory data analyses to compare serum from 83 patients with ME/CFS and 35 healthy controls. Some changes were common in the patient group, and these were compatible with effects of elevated energy strain and altered utilization of fatty acids and amino acids as catabolic fuels. In addition, a set of heterogeneous effects reflected specific changes in 3 subsets of patients, and 2 of these expressed characteristic contexts of deregulated energy metabolism. The biological relevance of these metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) was supported by clinical data and independent blood analyses. In summary, we report a map of common and context-dependent metabolic changes in ME/CFS, and some of them presented possible associations with clinical patient profiles. We suggest that elevated energy strain may result from exertion-triggered tissue hypoxia and lead to systemic metabolic adaptation and compensation. Through various mechanisms, such metabolic dysfunction represents a likely mediator of key symptoms in ME/CFS and possibly a target for supportive intervention.","output":"A map of metabolic phenotypes in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of pathogens is necessary for food quality monitoring, and increasing the survival rate of individuals. Conventional microbiological methods used to identify microorganisms, starting from bacterial culture and ending with advanced PCR gene identification, are time-consuming, laborious and expensive. Thus, in this study, a bacterial imprinted polymer (BIP)-based biosensor was designed and fabricated for rapid and selective detection of Salmonella typhimurium. Bio-recognition sites were made by creating template-shaped cavities in the electro-polymerized polydopamine matrices on a gold screen-printed electrode. The overall changes of the sensor, during the imprinting process, have been investigated with cyclic voltammetry, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The assay optimization and validation were accomplished, hence the highest sensitivity and selectivity towards S. typhimurium were achieved. As a result, a very low limit of detection of 47 CFU ml(?1), and a limit of quantification of 142 CFU ml(?1) were achieved using the newly-developed biosensor. No interference signals were detected when the S. typhimurium was tested in a mixed culture with other non-targeted pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Eventually, the biosensor was applied to minced beef meat samples offering not only fast detection but also direct determination with no bacterial enrichment steps.","output":"Voltammetric determination of Salmonella typhimurium in minced beef meat using a chip-based imprinted sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper computes the refractive indices of different corona viruses (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, H4N6, FAdV and IBV) through reflectance analysis of a virus solution The computational analysis indicates that the refractive indices of all viruses are negative at the signal of 412 nm Further the numerical output shows that the infectious bronchitis viruses (family of novel corona viruses, COVID-19) have higher negative refractive indices as compared to other corona viruses Finally refractive indices of the family of COVID-19 are investigated with respect to the EID (Electronic infusion Device) concentration of the viruses, showing that the refractive index which ranges from -0 96725 to-0 999998 corresponds to 0 01 to 10000 EID virus concentration ? 2020 Current Optics and Photonics","output":"Computation of refractive indices of corona viruses through reverse calculation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review We provide the readers with a review of cardiac complications in children with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and its short-term outcomes.

Methods Patients who had an active DFU during the COVID-19 emergency were included. All participants were managed using a specific triage system driven both by ulcerseverity and concomitant co-diseases. Subjects with severely complicated DFUs were urgently referred to hospital regardless of the concomitant comorbidities. Subjects with complicated DFUs received outpatient evaluation (within 48-72 hours) and were admitted to hospital if required (revascularization, surgical intervention, intravenous antibiotic therapy); after the first outpatient visit or hospitalization, patients were followed according to the number of comorbidities (in the case of 3 or more comorbidities patiente were followed up by telemedicine). Patients with uncomplicated DFUs were managed by telemedicine after outpatient evaluation. Healing, major amputation, death and rate of COVID-19 infection were evaluated. The minimum follow-up was 1 month. Results The study group included 151 patients. The mean age was 69.914.2 years, 58.9% were male and 91.4% had type 2 diabetes; 58.7% had severely complicated, 21% complicated and 20.3% uncomplicated DFUs.

DIAGNOSIS: On slit lamp examination, a near total corneal and conjunctival epithelial defect with limbal pale on the lower half of the cornea was noted. Severe ocular burn by ABHS was prominent with suspected limbal stem cell damage. INTERVENTIONS: She was hospitalized and was prescribed topical medications including antibiotics, steroid eye drops with preservative-free artificial tears, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. OUTCOMES: Despite intensive medical treatments, the corneal and conjunctival epithelial defects showed no improvement up to the 4(th) hospital day. After additional instillation of autoserum eye drops to promote epithelial healing, the corneal epithelium barely recovered from the temporal limbus. On the third week of admission, the epithelial defect was completely resolved without corneal opacity, although with minimal symblepharon in the lower fornix.

In this review, we aim to decipher the various lines of evidence supporting the bidirectional association between psoriasis and obesity highlighting their pathophysiologic connections as well as we attempt to strategize a therapeutic holistic approach for obese psoriatic patients. RECENT FINDINGS Recent meta-analyses have shown that (1) genetically higher BMI increased the odds of psoriasis occurrence; (2) obesity is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of psoriasis as well as psoriasis severity; (3) obesity is associated with lower efficacy to anti-TNF agents and may predict biologic treatment discontinuation; and (4) weight loss through diet and physical exercise may improve pre-existing psoriasis and prevent from de novo psoriasis. Methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine could worsen hypertension, liver steatosis, and dyslipidemia. Since infliximab and ustekinumab are weight adjusted, they may be ideal drugs to treat obese psoriatic patients. IL-17 inhibitors are very effective independently from body weight; however, they tend to present better clearance rates in normal weight patients. There is a paucity on weight data regarding the efficacious IL-23 inhibitors. Apremilast may induce weight loss as an adverse effect presenting also some beneficial metabolic actions. Finally, simvastatin and some antidiabetic drugs could decrease psoriasis severity.

OBJECTIVE The present cadaver study was designed to assess the true location of tacks after mesh fixation during laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy in relation to vascular and nerve structures and bony landmarks. DESIGN Interventional cadaver study. SETTING After laparoscopic mesh fixation detailed pelvic dissection was performed following a standardized protocol. In addition, a 64-row multidetector computed tomography was conducted to further define lumbosacral anatomy and tack positioning. PATIENTS Eighteen fresh cadavers (10 female, 8 male) were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES True tack position and vascular and neuronal involvement. RESULTS A total of 52 tacks were deployed (median 3, 2-3 tacks). Median tack distance to the midsacral promontory was 16.1mm (0.0-54.2). Only a total of 22 tacks (42.3%) were found on the right surface of the S1 vertebra, correlating with the planned deployment area. In seven cadavers (38.8%) all tacks were deployed on the planned deployment area. The median distance to the major vessels was 10.5mm (0.0-35.0), which was the internal iliac artery in half of the cases. Median distance of tacks to the right ureter was 32.1mm (7.5-46.1). Neither major vessels nor the ureter was injured. Dissection of the hypogastric plexus was undertaken in 14 cadavers and in each cadaver, tacks affected the hypogastric nerve plexus.

Its containment represents a unique challenge for India due to a large population (>1.38 billion) across a wide range of population densities. Assessment of the COVID-19 disease burden is required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of COVID-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to COVID-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). Scenario analyses were conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for reported COVID-19 deaths. The direct impact of COVID-19 in 2020 in India was responsible for 14,106,060 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 14,030,129-14,213,231) DALYs, consisting of 99.2% (95% UI 98.47-99.64%) YLLs and 0.80% (95% UI 0.36-1.53) YLDs. DALYs were higher in urban (56%; 95% UI 56-57%) than rural areas (44%; 95% UI 43.4-43.6) and in males (64%) than females (36%). In absolute terms, the highest DALYs occurred in the 51-60-year-old age group (28%) but the highest DALYs per 100,000 persons were estimated for the 71-80 year old age group (5,481; 95% UI 5,464-5,500 years). There were 4,823,791 (95% UI 4,760,908-4,924,307) DALYs after considering reported COVID-19 deaths only. The DALY estimations have direct and immediate implications not only for public policy in India, but also internationally given that India represents one sixth of the worlds population.","output":"Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to the direct health impact of COVID-19 in India, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De Freitas et al discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism are impacting Black mental health.

However, rigorous determination of SARS-COV-2 infectivity is essentially impossible owing to its continuous evolution with over 13752 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in six different subtypes. We develop an advanced machine learning algorithm based on the algebraic topology to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor following the mutations. Based on mutation-induced binding affinity changes, we reveal that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become either moderately or slightly more infectious, while one subtype has weakened its infectivity. We find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-ACE2 binding affinity changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding affinity calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif (RBM), i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have very high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.","output":"Mutations strengthened SARS-CoV-2 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When reasoning about container data structures that can hold duplicate elements, multisets are the obvious choice for representing the data structure abstractly. However, the decidability and complexity of constraints on multisets has been much less studied and understood than for constraints on sets. In this presentation, we outline an efficient decision procedure for reasoning about multisets with cardinality constraints. We describe how to translate, in linear time, multisets constraints to constraints in an extension of quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic, which we call LIA*. LIA* extends linear integer arithmetic with unbounded sums over values satisfying a given linear arithmetic formula. We show how to reduce a LIA* formula to an equisatisfiable linear integer arithmetic formula. However, this approach requires an explicit computation of semilinear sets and in practice it scales poorly even on simple benchmarks. We then describe a recent more efficient approach for checking satisfiability of LIA*. The approach is based on the use of under- and over-approximations of LIA* formulas. This way we avoid the space overhead and explicitly computing semilinear sets.

We performed the meta-analysis using Comprehensive meta-analysis software, version 3. Main results A total of 29 studies were included in the meta-analysis;from 17 of these, the SB rate was 7 per 1000 in pregnant women with COVID-19. This rate was much higher (34/1000) in low- and middle-income countries. The odds ratio of stillbirth in pregnant women with COVID-19 compared to those without was 1.89. However, there was no significant difference in population SB rates before and during the pandemic. Conclusions There is some evidence that the stillbirth rate has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this is mainly in low- and middle-income countries.

This retrospective cohort study is a comprehensive analysis of the initial symptoms, comorbidities and laboratory evaluation of patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 in Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, from 4th February to 12th March, 2020. Based on the data collected from 63 severely ill patients from the onset of symptoms till the full recovery or demise, we found not only age (average 70) but also blood indicators as significant risk factors associated with multiple organ failure. The blood indices of all patients showed hepatic, renal, cardiac and hematopoietic dysfunction with imbalanced coagulatory biomarkers. We noticed that the levels of LDH (85%, P < .001), HBDH (76%, P < .001) and CRP (65%, P < .001) were significantly elevated in deceased patients, indicating hepatic impairment. Similarly, increased CK (15%, P = .002), Cre (37%, P = 0.102) and CysC (74%, P = 0.384) indicated renal damage.

Studies suggest that folic acid has antiviral effects. Molecular docking shown that folic acid can act on SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (SARS-CoV-2 N). OBJECTIVE: To identify novel molecular therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Traditional Chinese medicine targets and virus-related genes were identified with network pharmacology and big data analysis. Folic acid was singled out by molecular docking, and its potential target SARS-CoV-2 N was identified. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 N of folic acid was verified at the cellular level. RESULTS: In total, 8355 drug targets were potentially involved in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. 113 hub genes were screened by further association analysis between targets and virus-related genes. The hub genes related compounds were analysed and folic acid was screened as a potential new drug. Moreover, molecular docking showed folic acid could target on SARS-CoV-2 N which inhibits host RNA interference (RNAi). Therefore, this study was based on RNAi to verify whether folic acid antagonises SARS-CoV-2 N. Cell-based experiments shown that RNAi decreased mCherry expression by 81.7% (p < 0.001). This effect was decreased by 8.0% in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 N inhibits RNAi. With increasing of folic acid concentration, mCherry expression decreased, indicating that folic acid antagonises the regulatory effect of SARS-CoV-2 N on host RNAi. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid may be an antagonist of SARS-CoV-2 N, but its effect on viruses unclear.

This study assessed the in vitro virucidal activity of 0.5% (w/v) povidone-iodine (PVP-I) oral rinse against SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate its utility as a professional oral rinse. METHODS: A 0.5% (w/v) PVP-I oral rinse formulation, placebo oral rinse, and positive (70% [v/v] ethanol and water) and negative (water) controls were assessed using the time-kill method. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero 76 host cells. Following neutralization validation, triplicate tests were performed for each test formulation and virucidal activity measured at 15, 30, and 60 s and 5 min. RESULTS: The 0.5% (w/v) PVP-I oral rinse demonstrated effective in vitro virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 as early as 15 s after exposure; viral titer was reduced to < 0.67 log(10) 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID(50))/0.1 mL (log(10) reduction of > 4.0) at 30 s, whereas the placebo oral rinse reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral titer to 4.67 and 4.5 log(10) CCID(50)/0.1 mL at the 15- and 30-s time points, with a log(10) reduction of 0.63 and 0.17, respectively.

Patients without clinical findings concerning for acute colonic perforation undergo bedside digital rectal examination and proctoscopic attempt at removal of RFB. If unsuccessful, patients undergo rectal examination under anesthesia with proctoscopy and attempted RFB removal. If the RFB cannot be easily removed, a TAMIS port is inserted into the anal canal and pneumorectum is established. A laparoscopic camera and instruments are then used to facilitate removal of the RFB. To date, TAMIS was successful in all 10 patients with RFB requiring an operation. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged to home from the postoperative recovery room.

METHODS: Parents completed a questionnaire for their children (ages 8.3  2.4 years, n = 53) regarding visual activity in summer 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during school time and the summer before COVID-19. Children also wore an Actiwatch for 10 days in summer 2020 for objective measures of light exposure, activity, and sleep. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Subjective measures showed that during COVID-19, children exhibited increased electronic device use and decreased activity and time outdoors (P < 0.05 for all), while time spent doing near work was not different than during a typical school or summer session before COVID-19 (P > 0.05).

EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to estimate changes in clinic visitation with a focus on transitions from the prelockdown to the level 5, 4 and 3 lockdown periods. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses, we assessed visitation for the following subcategories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases and by age and sex strata. RESULTS: We found no change in total clinic visits/clinic/day at the time of implementation of the level 5 lockdown (change from 90.3 to 84.6 mean visits/clinic/day, 95% CI -16.5 to 3.1), or at the transitions to less stringent level 4 and 3 lockdown levels. We did detect a >50% reduction in child healthcare visits at the start of the level 5 lockdown from 11.9 to 4.7 visits/day (-7.1 visits/clinic/day, 95% CI -8.9 to 5.3), both for children aged <1 year and 1-5 years, with a gradual return to prelockdown within 3 months after the first lockdown measure.

We compared hearing screening outcomes in neonates born to women with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy with healthy controls. METHODS: Neonates born between April and December 2020 in our hospital to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were included in this study. Neonates with risk factors for universal newborn hearing screening (NHS) were excluded. Neonates born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were compared with healthy controls in terms of newborn hearing screening results and independent variables. RESULTS: Neonates in the COVID-19 group were more likely to have a refer result in auditory brainstem responses (ABR) compared with the control group (53/118 and 28/118, respectively; p = 0.001). The second ABR test results did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.618). Logistic regression revealed that birth week and type of birth were not associated with the refer result. PCR positivity in the second trimester was more likely to produce the refer result in the first ABR test (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk of abnormal NHS results. Also, the timing of PCR positivity in pregnancy (trimester) may be related to abnormal NHS results.","output":"Hearing screening outcomes in neonates of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report two cases of successful use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to control of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)-related mediastinitis.

The purpose of the study was to quantitatively identify sentiments, emotions, and trends in nurses' tweets and to explore the variations in sentiments and emotions over a period in 2020 with respect to the number of cases and deaths of COVID\\\\19 worldwide. DESIGN: A cross\\\\sectional data mining study was held from March 3, 2020 through December 3, 2020. The tweets related to COVID\\\\19 were downloaded using the tweet IDs available from a public website. Data were processed and filtered by searching for keywords related to nursing in the profile description field using the R software and JMP Pro Version 16 and the sentiment analysis of each tweet was done using AFINN, Bing, and NRC lexicon. FINDINGS: A total of 13,868 tweets from the Twitter accounts of self\\\\identified nurses were included in the final analysis. The sentiment scores of nurses' tweets fluctuated over time and some clear patterns emerged related to the number of COVID\\\\19 cases and deaths. Joy decreased and sadness increased over time as the pandemic impacts increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Twitter data can be leveraged to study the emotions and sentiments of nurses, and the findings suggest that the emotional realm of nurses was affected during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic according to the emotional trends observed in tweets.

Public knowledge and perceptions significance in tackling pandemics have been evidenced in the previous research. This study aimed to explore public perceptions about pharmacists' educational and prescribing role, and the medication delivery service provided during COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Jordan using a convenient sampling technique for ten days (15-25 May 2020). Data was collected from 578 participants who agreed to fill the questionnaire, which was distributed online. The questionnaire items were piloted using face validity and reliability. RESULT: Participants showed a positive perception about the impact of pharmacists and pharmacy services provided during COVID-19 outbreak. More than half of the participants (61.1%) believed that pharmacists could prescribe over the counter medications, and only 15.7% believed that pharmacists could prescribe both over the counter and prescribed medications. Linear regression was performed to assess the factors that affect the participants' perception of pharmacists' prescribing and educational role and delivering medication during COVID-19. Females have lower perception scores towards medication delivery services compared to males (P-value= 0.008). However, male participants, those aged less than 50 years, those with postgraduate degrees, and those from non-medical profession showed a significantly higher perception score towards the impact of pharmacists and pharmacy services provided during COVID-19 outbreak compared to others (P-value <0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the public positively endorsed the impact of the educational role of the pharmacist, medication delivery services, and extending pharmacist prescribing authority during COVID 19 pandemic. Also, findings from this study provide a platform to examine the perception of the public toward pandemic diseases and inform policy decision-makers to react by updating their regulation to allow extending pharmacy services and prescribing role during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Public Perceptions about Pharmacists' Role in Prescribing, Providing Education and Delivering Medications during COVID-19 Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus. Our knowledge about the survival rate and prognostic factors of the disease is not established well. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictors of COVID-19 mortality in Hamadan province in western Iran. Methods: In this study, we included all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with known treatment outcomes in Hamadan province, Iran, between 20, 2020, to May 10, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes were obtained from computerized medical records and compared between survived cases and patients with death outcomes. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of death. Results: From 749 investigated patients, 77 patients (10.28%) died during the treatment. The Mean age of patients was 53.9719.04 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that males had 2.07 (95% CI: 1.73, 2.54) fold higher odds of death. Those with 60 years old and more had 6.49 (95% CI: 4.53, 7.93) fold higher odds of death.

The public health restrictions in response to COVID-19 have interrupted habitual physical activity behaviours in older adults. In response, numerous exercise programmes have been developed for older adults, many involving chair-based exercise. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the effects of chair-based exercise on the health of older adults. Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PyscInfo and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to 1 April 2020. Chair-based exercise programmes in adults &#8805;50 years, lasting for at least 2 weeks and measuring the impact on physical function were included. Risk of bias of included studies were assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool v2. Intervention content was described using TiDieR Criteria. Where sufficient studies (&#8805;3 studies) reported data on an outcome, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. In total, 25 studies were included, with 19 studies in the meta-analyses. Seventeen studies had a low risk of bias and five had a high risk of bias.

METHODS: This study first examined current epidemiological reports to better understand the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Past epidemiological studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS were also examined given similar virology. Next, at best and at worst mortality cases were considered with the goal of estimating the probability of mortality. To accomplish this for the general population, microdata from the National Health Interview Survey pooled sample (2016, 2017, and 2018 IPUMS NHIS with a sample of 34,881 adults at least 60 years of age) were utilized. Primary measures included age and health status (diabetes, body mass index, and hypertension). A logit regression with 100,000 simulations was employed to derive the estimates and probabilities. RESULTS: Age exhibited a positive association for the probability of death with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 (p<0.05, 1.05-1.42, 95% C.I.). A positive association was also found for obesity (OR 1.03, p<0.01, 1.02-1.04 95% C.I.) and hypertension (OR 1.36, p<0.01, 1.09-1.66 95% C.I.) for the at best case. Diabetes was significant but only for the at best case. DISCUSSION: This study found mortality increased with age and was notable for the 74-79 age group for the at best case and the 70-79 age group of the at worst case. Obesity was also important and suggested a higher risk for mortality. Hypertension also exhibited greater risk but the increase was minimal. Given the volume of information and misinformation, these findings can be applied by health professionals, gerontologists, social workers, and local policymakers to better inform older adults about mortality risks and, in the process, re-establish public trust.","output":"Estimating older adult mortality from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quercetin is a phenolic flavonol compound with established antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-stimulant properties.

This article highlighted the prophylactic/therapeutic potential of quercetin against COVID-19 in view of its clinical studies, inventions, and patents. The literature for the subject matter was collected utilizing different databases, including PubMed, Sci-Finder, Espacenet, Patentscope, and USPTO. Clinical studies expose the potential of quercetin monotherapy, and also its combination therapy with other compounds, including zinc, vitamin C, curcumin, vitamin D3, masitinib, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin. The patent literature also examines claims that quercetin containing nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements, alone or in combination with other drugs/compounds, including favipiravir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, navitoclax, dasatinib, disulfiram, rucaparib, tamarixin, iota-carrageenan, and various herbal extracts (aloe, poria, rosemary, and sphagnum) has potential for use against COVID-19. The literature reveals that quercetin exhibits anti-COVID-19 activity because of its inhibitory effect on the expression of the human ACE2 receptors and the enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 (MPro, PLPro, and RdRp).

BACKGROUND Acute results and safety profiles of deliberate stent fracture within the pulmonary vasculature have been demonstrated. The long-term impact of early stent intervention and deliberate stent fracture on PA growth and myocardial function is not understood. METHODS Implantation of small diameter stents was performed in a pig model of left PA stenosis at 6 weeks (10 kg) followed by dilations at 10 (35 kg) and 18 weeks (65 kg) with intent to fracture and implant large diameter stents. Hemodynamics, RV contractility, and 2D/3D angiography were performed with each intervention. The heart and pulmonary vasculature were histologically assessed. RESULTS Stent fracture occurred in 9/12 and implantation of large diameter stents was successful in 10/12 animals with no PA aneurysms or dissections. The final stented PA segment and distal left PA branch origins equaled the corresponding PA diameters of sham controls. Growth of left PA immediately beyond the stent was limited and there was diffuse fibro-intimal proliferation within the distal left and right PA. RV contractility was diminished in the intervention group and the response to dobutamine occurred uniquely via increases in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS Early stent intervention in this surgically created PA stenosis model was associated with improved growth of the distal PA vasculature but additional investigation of PA vessel physiology and impact on the developing heart are needed.","output":"Consequences of an early catheter-based intervention on pulmonary artery growth and right ventricular myocardial function in a pig model of pulmonary artery stenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front-line health care workers (HCW) and first responders (FR). The specific components of COVID-19 related occupational stressors (CROS) associated with psychiatric symptoms and reduced occupational functioning or retention remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Examine the relationships between total and factored CROS, psychiatric symptoms, and occupational outcomes. DESIGN: Observational, self-report, single time-point online assessment. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 510 US HCW (N = 301) and FR (N = 200) with occupational duties affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: CROS were assessed using a custom 17-item questionnaire. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, insomnia, and generalized anxiety symptoms were assessed using the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL5), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7). Respondents likelihood of leaving current field and occupational functioning were assessed with 2-item PROMIS subscales. Relationships were modeled using multivariable regression. Open-ended responses were coded using rapid template analysis. RESULTS: CROS total scores correlated significantly with all four psychiatric symptom domains (Rs = .42C.53), likelihood of leaving ones current occupation (R = .18), and trouble doing usual work (R = .28), all ps < .001. Half of HCW indicated a decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation as a result of the pandemic. CROS were fit to a 3-factor model consisting of risk, demoralization, and volume factors. All CROS factors were associated with psychiatric symptom burden, but demoralization was most prominently associated with psychiatric symptoms and negative occupational outcomes. Among psychiatric symptoms, PTSD symptoms were most strongly associated with negative occupational outcomes. Open-ended statements emphasized lack of protection and support, increased occupational demands, and emotional impact of work duties. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results demonstrate potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms in HCW and FR experiencing CROS, impacting both wellbeing and the health care system. Mitigating CROS, particularly by addressing factors driving demoralization, may improve HCW and FR mental health, occupational functioning, and retention.

The peptide-binding grooves of most alleles of histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) are relatively hydrophobic, therefore peptide fragments derived from human transmembrane helices (TMHs) are predicted to be presented more often as would be expected based on their abundance in the proteome. However, the physiological reason of why membrane proteins might be over-presented is unclear. In this study, we show that the predicted over-presentation of TMH-derived peptides is general, as it is predicted for bacteria and viruses and for both MHC-I and MHC-II, and confirmed by re-analysis of epitope databases. Moreover, we show that TMHs are evolutionarily more conserved, because single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present relatively less frequently in TMH-coding chromosomal regions compared to regions coding for extracellular and cytoplasmic protein regions. Thus, our findings suggest that both cytolytic and helper T cells are more tuned to respond to membrane proteins, because these are evolutionary more conserved.

It is considered a challenging problem due to existing similar image densities in the pulmonary structures, different types of scanners, and scanning protocols. Most of the current semi-automatic segmentation methods rely on human factors therefore it might suffer from lack of accuracy. Another shortcoming of these methods is their high false-positive rate. In recent years, several approaches, based on a deep learning framework, have been effectively applied in medical image segmentation. Among existing deep neural networks, the U-Net has provided great success in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture to perform an automatic lung CT image segmentation process. In the proposed method, several extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to raw CT images. Then, ground truths corresponding to these images are extracted via some morphological operations and manual reforms. Finally, all the prepared images with the corresponding ground truth are fed into a modified U-Net in which the encoder is replaced with a pre-trained ResNet-34 network (referred to as Res BCDU-Net). In the architecture, we employ BConvLSTM (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-term Memory)as an advanced integrator module instead of simple traditional concatenators. This is to merge the extracted feature maps of the corresponding contracting path into the previous expansion of the up-convolutional layer. Finally, a densely connected convolutional layer is utilized for the contracting path. The results of our extensive experiments on lung CT images (LIDC-IDRI database) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method where a dice coefficient index of 97.31% is achieved.","output":"ResBCDU-Net: A Deep Learning Framework for Lung CT Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the identification of context-free grammars based on the presentation of samples is investigated.

A horticultural intervention introduced ornamental plants to 38 previously bare front gardens ( 10 m(2)) within an economically deprived region of North England, UK. Measures of perceived stress and diurnal cortisol profiles (as an indicator of health status) were taken pre- and post-intervention (over 3 months). Residents reported significant decreases in perceived stress post-intervention. This finding was aligned with a higher proportion of healthy diurnal cortisol patterns post-intervention, suggesting better health status in those individuals. All residents derived one or more reported socio-cultural benefits as a result of the front garden plantings, although overall scores for subjective well-being did not increase to a significant level. Further qualitative data suggested that the gardens were valued for enhancing relaxation, increasing positive emotions, motivation, and pride of place. The results indicate that adding even small quantities of ornamental plants to front gardens within deprived urban communities had a positive effect on an individuals stress regulation and some, but not all, aspects of subjective well-being.

Willing to contribute with this fight to defeat COVID-19, we performed a virtual screening study on a library containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, in a search for molecules capable of hitting three main molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results were refined with further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM-PBSA calculations and pointed to 7 multi-target hits which we propose here for experimental evaluation and repurposing as potential drugs against COVID-19. Additional rounds of docking, MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations with remdesivir suggested that this compound can also work as a multi-target drug against SARS-CoV-2.

The short-term effects on PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, NO, NOx, O3 and CO concentrations measured at 51 air quality measurement stations (AQMS) in 11 cities in March C April period of 2020 were statistically compared with that of the previous year. While PM2.5 (9/14 AQMS) and PM10 (29/35 AQMS) concentrations were not significantly affected, NO (12/24 AQMS), NO2 (20/29 AQMS), NOX (17/25 AQMS) concentrations were decreased, SO2 concentrations at half of the AQMSs (11/25) did not show a significant change. There were stations at which higher pollutant concentrations were measured in the study period in 2020 compared to that of 2019. Excess risks associated with PM2.5 and PM10 were estimated to be variable, albeit with a small difference.

These pressures may cause burnout and job dissatisfaction, with negative implications for patient care. Medical scribes, who perform real-time electronic health record documentation, have been posited as a solution to relieve clerical burdens, thus improving provider satisfaction and other outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify and synthesize the published research on medical scribe utilization in primary care and safety net settings. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted a review of the literature to identify outcomes studies published between 2010 and 2020 assessing medical scribe utilization in primary care settings. Searches were conducted in PubMed and supplemented by a review of the gray literature. Articles for inclusion were reviewed by the study authors and synthesized based on study characteristics, medical scribe tasks, and reported outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 21 publications for inclusion, including 5 that examined scribes in health care safety net settings. Scribe utilization was consistently reported as being associated with improved productivity and efficiency, provider experience, and documentation quality. Findings for patient experience were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Published studies indicate scribe utilization in primary care may improve productivity, clinic and provider efficiencies, and provider experience without diminishing the patient experience.

The virus causes the disease not only in people but also in companion and wild animals. People with diabetes are at risk of the disease. As yet we do not know why the virus has been highly successful in causing the pandemic within 3 months of its first report. The structural proteins of SARS include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). METHODS: The structure and function of the most abundant structural protein of SARS-CoV-2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, is not fully understood. Using in silico analyses we determined the structure and potential function of the M protein. RESULTS: The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-trans-membrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET. SemiSWEETs are related to the PQ-loop family whose members function as cargo receptors in vesicle transport, mediate movement of basic amino acids across lysosomal membranes, and are also involved in phospholipase flippase function. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage and role of the M protein having a sugar transporter-like structure is not clearly understood. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with S, E, and N protein. The S protein of the virus is glycosylated. It could be hypothesized that the sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein influences glycosylation of the S protein. Endocytosis is critical for the internalization and maturation of RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Sucrose is involved in endosome and lysosome maturation and may also induce autophagy, pathways that help in the entry of the virus. Overall, it could be hypothesized that the SemiSWEET sugar transporter-like structure of the M protein may be involved in multiple functions that may aid in the rapid proliferation, replication, and immune evasion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Biological experiments would validate the presence and function of the SemiSWEET sugar transporter.","output":"The Structure of the Membrane Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Resembles the Sugar Transporter SemiSWEET"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we address the problem of the estimation of the approximation error that arise at a discretization of the partial differential equations.

In this review, I focus on the various mechanisms through which nucleic acid drugs act on, the status of their clinical development, and discuss several hurdles that need to be surmounted. In addition, by listing examples of how the progress in exosome biology can lead to the solution of problems in nucleic acid drug therapy, I hope that many more nucleic acid drugs including anticancer drugs will be developed in the future. ABSTRACT: Nucleic acid drugs are being developed as novel therapeutic modalities. They have great potential to treat human diseases such as cancers, viral infections, and genetic disorders due to unique characteristics that make it possible to approach undruggable targets using classical small molecule or protein/antibody-based biologics. In this review, I describe the advantages, classification, and clinical status of nucleic acid therapeutics. To date, more than 10 products have been launched, and many products have been tested in clinics. To promote the use of nucleic acid therapeutics such as antibodies, several hurdles need to be surmounted. The most important issue is the delivery of nucleic acids and several other challenges have been reported. Recent advanced delivery platforms are lipid nanoparticles and ligand conjugation approaches.

This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We curate an age-stratified cfr dataset with Impact StatementDuring a global pandemic, understanding the causal effects of risk factors such as age on COVID-19 fatality is an important scientific question. Since randomised controlled trials are typically infeasible or unethical in this context, causal investigations based on observational datasuch as the one carried out in this articlewill, therefore, be crucial in guiding our understanding of the available data. Causal inference, in particular mediation analysis, can be used to resolve apparent statistical paradoxes;help educate the public and decision-makers alike;avoid unsound comparisons;and answer a range of causal questions pertaining to the pandemic, subject to transparently stated assumptions. Our exposition helps clarify how mediation analysis can be used to investigate direct and indirect effects along different causal paths and thus serves as a stepping stone for future studies of other important risk factors for COVID-19 besides age.","output":"Simpson's Paradox in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates: A Mediation Analysis of Age-Related Causal Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, the local health-care system was overwhelmed. Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak. METHODS: We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. FINDINGS: We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was \\"being fully responsible for patients' wellbeing-'this is my duty'\\". Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was \\"challenges of working on COVID-19 wards\\". Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was \\"resilience amid challenges\\". Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience. INTERPRETATION: The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.

Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill. The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We developed Hopewell Hospitalist, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of Hopewell Hospitalist for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing Hopewell Hospitalist for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase.

Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP1B1/1B3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1 and FLAG-OATP1B3 in HEK293-FLAG-OATP1B1 andCOATP1B3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50C250 nM, 2C7 h) significantly decreased transport of [(3)H]CCK-8, a specific OATP1B3 substrate, in HEK293-OATP1B3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [(3)H]E(2)17G and [(3)H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in HEK293-OATP1B1/1B3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (V(max)) of OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK-8 (92.25  14.2 vs. 133.95  15.5 pmol/mg protein/min) without affecting the affinity constant (K(m)) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP1B3-mediated [(3)H]CCK-8 transport. In summary, the current studies for the first time report ubiquitination of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and the apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib on OATP1B3-mediated transport.

The medical data of 7803 laboratory-confirmed patients who had been discharged or died by April 30, 2020 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Findings: On admission, 7383 (94a?5%) patients were asymptomatic or showed mild illness, and 372 (4a?8%) patients were severe illness. Also, 48 (0 0a?6%) were hospitalized with critically ill when diagnosed. Most patients with asymptomatic or mild illness on admission remained mild until discharge, 253 (3a?4%) progressed to severe illness, and 83 (1a?1%) died in hospital. However, the case fatality were 29a?8% and 62a?5% in severe and critically ill patients, respectively. At admission, 73a?0% of hospitalized patients had symptoms; most common were cough (42a?5%), sputum (28a?8%), and fever (20a?1%). Only 35a?2% of laboratory confirmed patients admitted to the temporary care facility complained of symptoms. Increasing odds of being critically ill was associated with older age (OR 28a?93, 95% CI 13a?34-62a?75 for age >70y, vs. age <50 y; p<0a?0001), being male (OR 2a?15, 95% CI1a?59-2a?89; p<0a?0001), fever (OR 2a?52, 95% CI 1.84-3a?45; p<0a?0001), and shortness of breath (OR 7a?40, 95% CI 5a?37-10a?19; p<0a?0001). Comorbid illness significantly increased risk of critical illness or death. Interpretation: Most cases were discharged as asymptomatic or recovered from mild illness, and only 9a?7% developed severe disease requiring oxygen therapy or more. Case fatality rate was 2a?9%, and markedly increased in those over age 50. Risk factors such as age, sex, fever, shortness of breath, and underlying disease can be useful in predicting future clinical severity. Additionally, the number of confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 patients significantly contribute to continued spread.

A recent study identified a specific subpopulation of microglia in the white matter of aged mice, termed white matter-associated microglia (WAM). Additionally, senescent microglia show impaired phagocytic function and altered lipid metabolism, which cause accumulation of lipid metabolites and eventually lead to myelin sheath degeneration. These results suggest that senescent WAM could be pivotal players in axonal loss during brain aging. The aim of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge on brain aging, with an emphasis on the roles of the white matter and microglia, and suggest potential approaches for rejuvenating the aged brain.","output":"White matter-associated microglia: New players in brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Participating in mentored undergraduate research experiences can improve students' grade point averages, retention, and job placement.

In this study, we explore how graduate student mentors and undergraduate student mentees at Washington University in St. Louis adapted to virtual research mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined changes in mentoring methods, research productivity, and the impact on the future plans of both mentors and mentees across six science/engineering departments. Survey responses from 79 mentees and 38 mentors indicated that a majority of mentees were able to have meaningful and productive virtual mentoring experiences, while other mentors failed to adequately involve their mentees in continued mentoring. Focusing virtual research experiences on activities such as literature review and data analysis and collaborating on goal setting can serve as a way for mentors to engage mentees even when they are unable to access lab equipment.

So far, various engineering strategies have been recruited to improve the production efficiency of this cell line such as apoptosis engineering. Previously, it is reported that the caspase-7 deficiency in CHO cells reduces the cell proliferation rate. But the effect of this reduction on the CHO cell productivity remained unclear. Hence, in the study at hand the effect of caspase-7 deficiency was assessed on the cell growth, viability and protein expression. In addition, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was investigated in the absence of caspase-7. RESULTS: Findings showed that in the absence of caspase-7, both cell growth and cell viability were decreased. Cell cycle analysis illustrated that the CHO knockout (CHO-KO) cells experienced a cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. This cell cycle arrest resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in the expression of luciferase in CHO-KO cells compared to parenteral cells. Furthermore, in the apoptotic situation the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in CHO-KO cells was approximately 3 times more than CHO-K1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represented that; however, caspase-7 deficiency reduces the cell proliferation rate but the resulted cell cycle arrest leads to the enhancement of recombinant protein expression. Moreover, increasing in the caspase-3 enzymatic activity compensates the absence of caspase-7 in the caspase cascade of apoptosis.","output":"Knockout of caspase-7 gene improves the expression of recombinant protein in CHO cell line through the cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE REPORT: Patient with COVID-19 and pre-existing pain syndrome Abstract.

The diagnose was made on the basis of the symptoms, which were described by the patient, and confirmed by an antibody test in August 2020. Aim: Due to the public interest in knowing more about the cluster of symptoms and their implications for nursing, the patient and the author of this paper decided to present this case study to the professional audience. Methods: For the anamnesis, the patient's COVID-19 diary and an essay by her about her experiences with the National Health Service (NHS) were analysed and completed by information collected during a structured interview. Results: It became apparent that the nursing diagnoses \\"Acute pain\\" and \\"Chronic pain\\" stand at the forefront. These nursing diagnoses have not been discussed in the context of COVID-19 yet.

Four-likert scale questionnaires were adapted and used to gather data including the lockdown fatigue scale (LFS), brief resilience scale (BRS), and coping appraisal. Findings reveal that majority of the respondents are female, 31-40 years old, married, with an on-going Masters Degree, with a permanent position in the university. The most prominent symptoms of fatigue, according to the respondents in this study, were worry, sadness, depression, tiredness or physical depletion, and anxiety. As to the personal resilience of lecturer, according to the findings, it is difficult for them to react quickly when anything negative occurs. As a result, efforts to reduce lockdown fatigue among lecturer must focus on developing their coping abilities, which will improve their mental and psychological well-being as well as their general health.

This study assesses the relationship between visible fractures on the top and bottom of core samples and the resulting hydraulic and mass transport properties of the core. We hypothesized that more visible fractures would indicate the presence of a well-connected fracture network, leading to greater hydraulic conductivity (K) values and earlier chemical breakthrough times. To test this hypothesis, water flow and bromide (Br-) tracer experiments were performed on ten, 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-tall samples of fractured Dows Formation till from central Iowa. Visually identifiable fractures were present on the top and bottom of every sample. Results indicate that the visual identification of fractures does not predict a connected fracture network, as some samples produced breakthrough curves showing rapid first arrival times and shapes characteristic of solute transport in a fractured medium, while others appeared similar to an unfractured medium. No correlation was found between the number of visible fractures and K (Pearson's r = 0.25), or Br- first arrival time (r = -0.33), but a strong negative correlation between K and first arrival time (r = -0.92). Results indicate that the sample volume was not large enough to reliably contain a connected fracture network. Thus, testing large volumes of till at the field scale coupled with fracture-flow modeling likely represents the best approach for estimating hydraulic and mass transport properties for fractured till.

Limitations of these results are unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT-interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia.

However, effects of BEA on dendritic cells remain unknown so far. Here, we identified effects of BEA on murine granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-cultured bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. BEA potently activates BMDCs as signified by elevated IL-12 and CD86 expression. Multiplex immunoassays performed on myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor inducing interferon beta (TRIF) single or double deficient BMDCs indicate that BEA induces inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in a MyD88/TRIF dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that BEA was not able to induce IL-12 or IFN production in Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4)-deficient BMDCs, whereas induction of these cytokines was not compromised in Tlr3/7/9 deficient BMDCs. This suggests that TLR4 might be the functional target of BEA on BMDCs. Consistently, in luciferase reporter assays BEA stimulation significantly promotes NF-B activation in mTLR4/CD14/MD2 overexpressing but not control HEK-293 cells. RNA-sequencing analyses further confirmed that BEA induces transcriptional changes associated with the TLR4 signaling pathway. Together, these results identify TLR4 as a cellular BEA sensor and define BEA as a potent activator of BMDCs, implying that this compound can be exploited as a promising candidate structure for vaccine adjuvants or cancer immunotherapies.","output":"The Mycotoxin Beauvericin Exhibits Immunostimulatory Effects on Dendritic Cells via Activating the TLR4 Signaling Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical diagnosis of patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness is very challenging.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.

IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a procoagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.

The sorting scheme predicts a dependency on the amount of ARFGAP1 and explains the recent experimental findings that ARF-1 and COPI detach with different time constants from the Golgi membrane in vivo.","output":"A kinetic proof-reading mechanism for protein sorting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The management of the current pandemic COVID-19 has been challenging and complex The main and only successes have been achieved with non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) When tracking, monitoring, and early intervention at home have been delivered to citizens, the contagion can be controlled In the current pandemic, various methods have been applied to track the COVID-19 virus, such as Korea's mobile phone tracking system We propose a method based on a wearable bracelet prototype able to detect biomedical parameters, which can be very useful to monitor the virus infection when the patient develops symptoms, such as a high temperature or low blood oxygenation In particular, the prototype bracelet can measure the blood oxygenation using an infrared optical sensor and measure the temperature of the patient The bracelet can record the identification number of other bracelet devices that came in proximity The bracelet is equipped with a built-in low power Bluetooth, aimed to send the recorded data to a smartphone or another device in order to connect them with proper geo-localization and to the web The identification number of the patient device can be used to trace the number of people and whom he has been in contact with, immediately by the sanitary authorities Moreover, the bracelet can be used for monitoring the patient's health at home, avoiding hospital's overcrowding The proposed system not only can effectively localize the trace path of patients positive to the COVID-19 virus or to other respiratory diseases, but also can provide an evolution of the patient symptoms and monitor people in-home quarantine The system is simple and could be an efficient tool to track any other future pandemics","output":"Monitoring the COVID-19 Diffusion by Combining Wearable Biosensors and Smartphones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An earthquake of magnitude 6.9 hit the city of Izmir (Turkey) on 30 October 2020, resulting in 117 deaths (in Turkey) and considerable economic losses.

The earthquake caused significant damages to residential buildings mainly located in the district of Bayrakli and Bornova. However, no damages were observed in railway and roadway bridges or tunnels and that helped the rescue operations. The damages were mainly structural which included the so-called pancake collapse (where the entire building collapsed) and soft storey type collapse (weak storey characterised with weak columns collapsed), and in some cases, only the ground floor completely collapsed.

The establishment of friendships is an important component of the adjustment for these students as they transition into their new school environments. This paper presents issues related to friendships, investigated as part of a larger study examining the motivations, expectations and experiences of international students from the Peoples Republic of China studying in Australian secondary schools. Data were collected in two phases from 116 international students and 10 teachers using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, and descriptive analyses employed. Because there is a paucity of information about the experiences of international secondary school students, this was an exploratory study that has contributed understanding of the lived experiences of a small group of international students from mainland China. The study identified that expectations regarding the establishment of friendships are not being met, and that international students from China are seeking more opportunities to form relationships with Australian peers. To reduce dissonance between expectations and experiences of studying in Australia, it is recommended that Australian schools work with both international and domestic students to provide authentic opportunities to build peer relationships.","output":"Making friends in Australia: expectations and experiences of Chinese international students in Australian secondary schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of 2019 a global pandemic by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) causing the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has emerged. Yet, COVID-19 represents a significant economic burden to healthcare systems, destabilizes global financial markets and has caused the death of almost 5 million people worldwide. In order to prevent severe disease courses of COVID-19 especially in elderly and to establish collective immunity on the long run, different vaccines have been developed, tested and were approved within a very short time period. In Germany, the first vaccines that have been approved by local authorities were AstraZeneca's vector virus-based vaccine Vaxzevria and the mRNA vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax, developed by BioNTech and Moderna, respectively. As it was reported that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 can trigger autoimmunity, it is of significant interest to investigate whether anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccines evoke the formation of autoantibodies and subsequent autoimmunity. Here, we did set out to systematically analyze immune responses after homologous vaccinations with mRNA or vector virus-based vaccines or after heterologous Vector/mRNA vaccinations with respect to anti-COVID-19 immune responses and, in parallel, the development of autoantibodies. In our study, we obtained serum samples one day before and 14 as well as 28 days following booster vaccination and tested them for anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies and for autoantibodies against Cardiolipin, Prothrombin, {beta}2-Glycoprotein, cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP), tissue-transglutaminase (TTG) and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). We find that compared to homologous mRNA and heterologous Vector/mRNA vaccination, anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody levels were 90% lower after homologous vector vaccination. Of note, heterologous Vector/mRNA vaccination was found to be more effective than homologous mRNA vaccination in terms of IgM and IgA responses against SARS-CoV2. However, in terms of autoantibody generation, we only detected increases after booster vaccination in participants with already pre-existing autoantibodies. In contrast, vaccinees showing no autoantibody formation before vaccination, did not respond with sustained autoantibody production upon vaccination. Taken together, our study suggests that all used SARS-CoV2 vaccines do not significantly foster autoantibody production over time but provide humoral immunity to SARS-CoV2.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination does not induce the formation of autoantibodies but provides humoral immunity following heterologous and homologous vaccination regimens: Results from a clinical and prospective study within professionals of a German University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The devastating effects of COVID-19 and the speed of both the scientific and medical response and the public information requirements about frontline healthcare work, medical advances and policy and compliance measures has necessitated an intensity of science communication never seen before This JCOM special issue - the first of two parts - looks at the challenges of communicating COVID-19 and coronavirus in the early spread of the disease in 2020 Here we present papers from across the world that demonstrate the scale of this challenge","output":"COVID-19 and science communication: a JCOM special issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The focus of this study was to produce composite flour with nutritional and functional potentials from underutilized and inexpensive crops, which can be used in food formulations as a substitute to composite flours from commonly used and expensive crops.

Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal, but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage, accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content, and genome-wide mutation. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 and RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis, and that the factors act in distinct ways. Finally, we reveal that loss of RAD51 has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.","output":"Conditional knockout of RAD51-related genes in Leishmania major reveals a critical role for homologous recombination during genome replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of masking the general population on a COVID-19 epidemic is estimated by computer simulation using two separate state-of-the-art web-based softwares, one of them calibrated for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

What types of masks exist, and how elaborate must a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be applied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some possible future research questions regarding masks and SARS-CoV-2. Results are as follows: (1) The results indicate that any type of mask, even simple home-made ones, may be effective. Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering new patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed \\"one-mask protection\\") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be critical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to > 50% was found to be advantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of intensive care. As the default parameters of the software included another intervention, it seems possible to combine mask and other interventions. (2) Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late stage in an epidemic. However, early implementation helps reduce the cumulative and total number of cases. (3) The simulations suggest that it might be possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a limited period.

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation.

A Sociodemographic Data Form, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used. RESULTS Of participants, 364 were females and 236 were males with a mean age of 33.497.29 years. About 95.3% of HCWs had a fear of infecting their loved ones. Mean MBI and ISI scores were significantly higher among HCWs working in COVID-19 clinics and intensive care units (p=0.000; p=0.039). Mean CAS, FCV-19S, MBI, and ISI scores were significantly higher in women than men (p=0.000; p=0.000; p=0.027; p=0.005).

METHOD: To examine the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Early Intervention service provision and implementation, 385 Early Intervention Illinois providers completed a web-based survey. Archival data were used to determine changes in number of Illinois Early Intervention referrals following the pandemic onset and to compare Illinois' telehealth and stay-at-home policies to those of other states. RESULTS: The majority (85%) of Illinois Early Intervention providers reported a disruption in service provision during COVID-19. The number of sessions delivered and the number of children per caseload decreased significantly. Provider confidence also decreased significantly. Only 28% of providers reported high confidence with telehealth. Identified benefits of telehealth included increased accessibility and caregiver involvement, whereas limitations included perceived lack of caregiver buy-in. New Illinois Early Intervention referrals and cases were lower during COVID-19 than in the previous year. Prior to 2020, 33 states did not have a permanent reimbursement policy for providing telehealth Early Intervention services. For states with a suspension of in-person Early Intervention services due to COVID-19, time to approval for telehealth reimbursement varied (0-22 days).

A COVID-19 screening and testing facility was created. There was a need for increasing throughput of the facility within the existing space and limited resources. Discrete event simulation was used to address this challenge. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional interventional study was done from September 2020 to October 2020. Detailed process mapping with all micro-processes was done. Patient arrival patterns and time taken at each step were measured by two independent observers at random intervals over two weeks. The existing system was simulated and a bottleneck was identified. Two possible alternatives to the problem were simulated and evaluated. RESULTS: Scenario 1 showed a maximum throughput of 316. The average milestone times of all the processes after the step of Preparation of sampling kits jumped 62%; from 82 to 133 min. Staff state times also showed that staff at this step was stretched and medical lab technicians were underutilized. Scenario 2 simulated the alternative with lesser time spent on sampling kit preparation with a 22.4% increase in throughput, but could have led to impaired quality check. Scenario 3 simulated with increased manpower at the stage of bottleneck with 26.5% increase in throughput and was implemented on-ground.

Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms \\"suicide\\" and \\"cause of death\\", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 081 [95% CI 072-091]); Alberta, Canada (080 [068-093]); British Columbia, Canada (076 [066-087]); Chile (085 [078-094]); Leipzig, Germany (049 [032-074]); Japan (094 [091-096]); New Zealand (079 [068-091]); South Korea (094 [092-097]); California, USA (090 [085-095]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (079 [067-093]); Texas (four counties), USA (082 [068-098]); and Ecuador (074 [067-082]). INTERPRETATION This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

Several surgical techniques have been described in the literature, responding differently to nonoperative treatment. The aim of this study is to describe a modified technique of stabilizing an AC joint dislocation with the new Infinity-Lock Button System, in order to demonstrate that it is effective in optimizing outcomes and decreasing complications. METHODS: this is a retrospective study of 15 patients who underwent surgical stabilization of the AC joint dislocation between 2018 and 2019, through modified surgical technique using the Infinity-Lock Button System. Active range of motion (ROM), Specific Acromio Clavicular Score (SACS) and Constant Score (CS) were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at last 18 months follow up. Patients rated their outcomes as very good, good, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. RESULTS: a total of twelve patients rated their outcome as very good and three as good; no patients were dissatisfied with surgery. The mean Constant Score increased from 38 points preoperatively to 95 postoperatively, the average SACS score decreased from 52 points preoperatively to 10 postoperatively, both significantly. No complications were detected. CONCLUSION: the described technique is effective for treatment of chronic grade III AC joint dislocation, resulting in elevated satisfaction ratings and predictable outcomes.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike protein, and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents. Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity molecules with dissociation constants (K(D)) in the nanomolar range (15C550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could be used as an affinity reagent to detect the spike protein in solution by ELISA, and the cocrystal structure of this molecule bound to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site, displacing a -strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, and the ligands discovered in this work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications.","output":"Discovery of Cyclic Peptide Ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Using mRNA Display"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunosuppression and immunomodulation are valuable therapeutic approaches for managing neuroimmunological diseases.

Although HCoV-specific drugs are still lacking, many potent targets for drug discovery are being explored, and many vigorously designed clinical trials are being carried out in an orderly manner. The aim of this review was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current status of drug development against HCoVs, particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). MAIN TEXT: A scoping review was conducted by electronically searching research studies, reviews, and clinical trials in PubMed and the CNKI. Studies on HCoVs and therapeutic drug discovery published between January 2000 and October 2020 and in English or Chinese were included, and the information was summarized. Of the 3248 studies identified, 159 publication were finally included. Advances in drug development against HCoV, especially SARS-CoV-2, are summarized under three categories: antiviral drugs aimed at inhibiting the HCoV proliferation process, drugs acting on the host's immune system, and drugs derived from plants with potent activity. Furthermore, clinical trials of drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. CONCLUSIONS: During the spread of COVID-19 outbreak, great efforts have been made in therapeutic drug discovery against the virus, although the pharmacological effects and adverse reactions of some drugs under study are still unclear. However, well-designed high-quality studies are needed to further study the effectiveness and safety of these potential drugs so as to provide valid recommendations for better control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we address this question by studying the CD4+ T cell response in unexposed individuals to live attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine. We quantified virus-specific population dynamics over time using class II peptide-MHC tetramers. Our data revealed that, even in the absence of known viral exposure, memory phenotype T cells were found in the majority of virus-specific precursors in healthy adults. Pre-existing memory T cells can be divided into two groups; abundant pre-vaccine populations that underwent limited overall expansion and rare cells that generated na?ve-like responses and preferentially contributed to the memory repertoire after vaccination. Single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was used to track the evolution of immune responses to different epitopes and showed an association between preservation of unexpanded TCRs before exposure and the robustness of post-vaccine responses. Instead of a further increase in pre-established TCR clones, vaccination boosted the representation of rare TCRs. Thus, vaccine restructures the abundance and clonal hierarchy of virus-specific T cells. Our results link T cell precursor states to post-exposure responses, identifying peripheral education of virus-specific repertoire as a key component of effective vaccination.  YFV-specific precursors contain abundant memory phenotype cells in healthy adults.  Precursor frequency and phenotype are linked to post-immune response.

However, understanding which circulating proteins are etiologically involved is difficult because their levels may be influenced by COVID-19 itself and also subject to confounding factors. To identify circulating proteins influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity we undertook a large-scale two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, since this study design can rapidly scan hundreds of circulating proteins and reduces bias due to confounding and reverse causation. We began by identifying the genetic determinants of 955 circulating proteins in up to 10,708 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected individuals, retaining only single nucleotide polymorphisms near the gene encoded by the circulating protein. We then undertook an MR study to estimate the effect of these proteins on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the Host Genetics Initiative.

Owing to the fact that many tasks do not necessarily require the knowledge and skills of a doctor, interest in using nurses to expand the capacity of the primary care workforce is increasing. Substitution of nurses for doctors is one strategy used to improve access, efficiency, and quality of care. This is the first update of the Cochrane review published in 2005. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to investigate the impact of nurses working as substitutes for primary care doctors on:? patient outcomes;? processes of care; and? utilisation, including volume and cost. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of the Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com), as well as MEDLINE, Ovid, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and EbscoHost (searched 20.01.2015). We searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey (21.02.2017), and we searched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries (21.02.2017). We did a cited reference search for relevant studies (searched 27.01 2015) and checked reference lists of all included studies. We reran slightly revised strategies, limited to publication years between 2015 and 2017, for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL, in March 2017, and we have added one trial to 'Studies awaiting classification'. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials evaluating the outcomes of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. The review is limited to primary healthcare services that provide first contact and ongoing care for patients with all types of health problems, excluding mental health problems. Studies which evaluated nurses supplementing the work of primary care doctors were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessment of risk of bias of included studies. When feasible, we combined study results and determined an overall estimate of the effect. We evaluated other outcomes by completing a structured synthesis. MAIN RESULTS For this review, we identified 18 randomised trials evaluating the impact of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. One study was conducted in a middle-income country, and all other studies in high-income countries. The nursing level was often unclear or varied between and even within studies. The studies looked at nurses involved in first contact care (including urgent care), ongoing care for physical complaints, and follow-up of patients with a particular chronic conditions such as diabetes. In many of the studies, nurses could get additional support or advice from a doctor. Nurse-doctor substitution for preventive services and health education in primary care has been less well studied.Study findings suggest that care delivered by nurses, compared to care delivered by doctors, probably generates similar or better health outcomes for a broad range of patient conditions (low- or moderate-certainty evidence):? Nurse-led primary care may lead to slightly fewer deaths among certain groups of patients, compared to doctor-led care. However, the results vary and it is possible that nurse-led primary care makes little or no difference to the number of deaths (low-certainty evidence).? Blood pressure outcomes are probably slightly improved in nurse-led primary care. Other clinical or health status outcomes are probably similar (moderate-certainty evidence).? Patient satisfaction is probably slightly higher in nurse-led primary care (moderate-certainty evidence). Quality of life may be slightly higher (low-certainty evidence).We are uncertain of the effects of nurse-led care on process of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low.The effect of nurse-led care on utilisation of care is mixed and depends on the type of outcome. Consultations are probably longer in nurse-led primary care (moderate-certainty evidence), and numbers of attended return visits are slightly higher for nurses than for doctors (high-certainty evidence). We found little or no difference between nurses and doctors in the number of prescriptions and attendance at accident and emergency units (high-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in the number of tests and investigations, hospital referrals and hospital admissions between nurses and doctors (low-certainty evidence).We are uncertain of the effects of nurse-led care on the costs of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review shows that for some ongoing and urgent physical complaints and for chronic conditions, trained nurses, such as nurse practitioners, practice nurses, and registered nurses, probably provide equal or possibly even better quality of care compared to primary care doctors, and probably achieve equal or better health outcomes for patients. Nurses probably achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction, compared to primary care doctors. Furthermore, consultation length is probably longer when nurses deliver care and the frequency of attended return visits is probably slightly higher for nurses, compared to doctors. Other utilisation outcomes are probably the same. The effects of nurse-led care on process of care and the costs of care are uncertain, and we also cannot ascertain what level of nursing education leads to the best outcomes when nurses are substituted for doctors.","output":"Nurses as substitutes for doctors in primary care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are two of the four human coronaviruses that circulate worldwide.

CO is used to grade cardiac function and is especially important when investigating cardiac injury (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI]). Critically, MI deforms the LV, invalidating the assumptions fundamental to calculating of cardiac volumes directly from the LV. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if Doppler-derived blood flow through the pulmonary trunk (pulmonary flow [PF]) was an improved method over conventional LV-dependent echocardiography to accurately determine CO after MI. METHODS Variations in CO were induced either by transverse aortic constriction or MI. Echocardiography was performed in healthy (n = 27), transverse aortic constriction (n = 25), and MI (n = 41) mice. CO calculated from PF (pulsed-wave Doppler) was internally compared with CO calculated from left ventricular images using M-mode (Teichholz formula) and the single-plane ellipsoid two-dimensional (2D) formula and externally compared with the gold standard, flow probe CO. RESULTS In healthy mice, all three echocardiographic methods (M-mode, 2D, and PF) correlated well with flow probe-derived CO. In MI mice, only PF CO values correlated well with flow probe values. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed that PF was improved over M-mode and 2D echocardiography. Inter- and intrauser variability of PF CO was reduced, and both inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients were improved compared with either M-mode or 2D CO calculations. CONCLUSIONS PF CO calculated from pulsed-wave Doppler through the pulmonary trunk was an improved method of estimating CO over LV-dependent formulas after MI.","output":"Pulmonary Flow as an Improved Method for Determining Cardiac Output in Mice after Myocardial Infarction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Over the last decades, the number of elderly patients on dialysis has rapidly grown on account of increased life expectancy, improved care and reduced mortality rate. Therefore, cooperation between geriatricians and nephrologists has become mandatory for co-managing kidney disease in these patients. Based on renewed interest in home hemodialysis (HHD), elderly patients may benefit from not being transported from their home for therapy. METHODS Here, we report our experience with HHD involving three elderly patients who were followed-up over a 15-months period in a nursing home. FINDINGS Our experience demonstrates that hospitalization abruptly dropped from 40 days to zero days, the need for erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) diminished, transportation-related costs for home treatments decreased, and quality of life (QoL) improved. This was confirmed by a questionnaire administered to our patients at the start and again after 6 months of HHD which evaluated the Physical Health Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Health Component Score (MCS). DISCUSSION Home hemodialysis may represent an important way to improve social, mental, and physical recovery, while also eliminating the cost of transportation and the discomfort of abandoning their \\"homes\\" and daily habits. Home hemodialysis is an effective alternative to in-center HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD) that should be offered to elderly patients when a home caregiver is not available, nonetheless, nursing assistance is required. Moreover, HHD allows patients to stay at home, thereby avoiding several weekly trips to the dialysis center, and may be useful in reducing infections, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by our experience.","output":"What can a home hemodialysis program offer to patients in a nursing home setting?

Korea, with its remarkable Information and Communications Technology infrastructure, introduced telemedicine in 1988, yet it has not been formally accepted owing to stakeholders' resistance and legal restrictions. Purpose: This study aims to determine the feasibility of implementing the telemedicine system and find solutions of its development and resistance by stakeholders. Method and Material: The authors present a unique case of Korea where telemedicine, despite its solid technological base, has not yet gained a foothold 32 years after its first pilot project. A narrative review was condected according to the timeline of government-driven telemedicine adoption in Korea, and an analysis was performed on the tendency of stakeholder resistance. Results: The analysis revealed that the relevant stakeholders were classified into doctors, patients, governments and some political parties. Among stakeholders as a whole, private healthcare physicians, who provide over 90% of primary care in Korea, amount to the largest demographic against the implementation of telemedicine. Their resistance was found to be the product of policies and problems arising from the coexistence of telemedicine and conventional healthcare regimes. With the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers are at odds with these stakeholders while implementing a pilot project. Conclusion: Fostering smooth policy implementation necessitates adopting an approach that reduces conflicts with private healthcare providers.","output":"Considerations on the Implementation of the Telemedicine System Encountered with Stakeholders' Resistance in COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel corona (COVID-19) disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus Covid-19 was started from Wuhan China and present it is spread all over the world Presently the USA is affected by the Covid-19 virus hardly Present there are more than 4 0 million confirmed cases and more than 200 thousand happens because of the Covid-19 virus [1] However, there is no medicine found by the researchers yet for the virus According to the WHO (World Health Organization), the COVID-19 virus is spreading by several methods And for protection from the COVID-19 virus, their suggestion is community distance Moreover, doctors and other medical instructors advise concentrating more on doing sanitizations often Presently there are lots of researches doing for identifying reasons, make a medicine in this area When it concentrates on the spread of the COVID-19 virus it cloud be able to identify that there is a difference between Asian and European countries As an example from Asian countries, only China and Russia are affected by the COVID-19 virus majorly However European countries like Italy, Spain has the highest death rates more than china Mainly south Asian countries have a low confirm rate of the COVID-19 virus [2] For this, the main reason what here in this research identified is the food used by each region We know that people in European countries eat fast foods and they have used alcohol more than the people in Asian countries [3] Therefore this research was done to identify a pattern between the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the Food categories used by the people So here in this research using data science Here it does some data modeling part to visualize a pattern between the spread of the COVID-19 virus and food categories Thereafter using a machine learning model here it implement a prediction model Through this research, it could be able to understand that there is a clear pattern between the spread of the virus and the food factors Moreover, this research will be a novel approach to evaluate the spread of the COVID-19 based on food categories ? 2020 IEEE","output":"COVID-19 Spread prediction Based on Food Categories using Data Science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Limited information exists on health care workers (HCWs) perceptions about use of multidose vaccine vials and their preferences about doses per container (DPC). We present findings from qualitative studies conducted in Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia to explore HCWs behavior regarding opening vials and their perceptions and preferences for the number of doses in vials of BCG and measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Zambia and Senegal currently offer MCV in 10-dose vials and BCG in 20-dose vials; 10-dose vials are used for both vaccines in Vietnam. Unused doses in vials of these reconstituted vaccines must be discarded within 6 hours. METHODS: Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with frontline HCWs in Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia. In Senegal and Vietnam, the KIIs were conducted as part of broader formative research; in Zambia, KIIs were conducted in control districts using 10-dose MCV vials only and in intervention districts that switched from 10- to 5-dose vials during the study. During analysis, themes common to all 3 countries were synthesized. Critical themes relevant to country contexts were also examined. RESULTS: HCWs in all 3 countries preferred containers with fewer doses for BCG and MCV to reduce wastage and increase the likelihood of vaccinating every eligible child. HCWs in Senegal and HCWs using 10-dose vials in Zambia reported sending unvaccinated children away because not enough children were present to warrant opening a new vial. In Vietnam, where sessions are typically held monthly, and in Zambia when the 5-dose vials were used, almost all HCWs reported opening a vial of MCV for even 1 child. DISCUSSION: HCWs prefer vials with fewer DPC. Their concerns about balancing coverage and wastage influence their decisions to vaccinate every eligible child; and their perspectives are crucial to ensuring that all target populations are reached with vaccines in a timely manner.","output":"Health Care Worker Preferences and Perspectives on Doses per Container for 2 Lyophilized Vaccines in Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a fast-growing worldwide pandemic. Aims: We aimed to investigate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among a large French cohort of implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients over the first 5 months of 2020. Methods: 5954 implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients were followed by remote monitoring during the COVID-19 period (from 01 January to 31 May 2020). Data were obtained from automated remote follow-up of implantable cardioverter defibrillators utilizing the Implicity? platform. For all patients, the type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), the number of ventricular arrhythmia episodes and the type of implantable cardioverter defibrillator-delivered therapy were recorded. Results: A total of 472 (7.9%) patients presented 4917 ventricular arrhythmia events. An increase in ventricular arrhythmia incidence was observed after the first COVID-19 case in France, and especially during weeks #10 and #11, at the time of major governmental measures, with an increase in the incidence of antitachycardia pacing delivered therapy. During the 11 weeks before the lockdown order, the curve of the percentage of live-stream television coverage of COVID-19 information matched the ventricular arrhythmia incidence. During the lockdown, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia decreased significantly compared with baseline (0.05  0.7 vs 0.09  1.2 episodes per patient per week, respectively; P < 0.001). Importantly, no correlation was observed between ventricular arrhythmia incidence and the curve of COVID-19 incidence. No changes were observed regarding atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia episodes over time. Conclusions: An increase in ventricular arrhythmia incidence was observed in the 2 weeks before the lockdown order, at the time of major governmental measures. Ventricular arrhythmia incidence decreased dramatically during the lockdown.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients followed by remote monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gender norms, roles and relations differentially affect women, men, and non-binary individuals' vulnerability to disease. Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.","output":"More than a public health crisis: A feminist political economic analysis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High salt intake has been related to the development to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as hypertension. In its early stages, symptoms of CKD are usually not apparent, especially those that are induced in a silent manner in normotensive individuals, thereby providing a need for some kind of urinary biomarker to detect injury at an early stage. Because traditional renal biomarkers such as serum creatinine are insensitive, it is difficult to detect kidney injury induced by a high-salt diet, especially in normotensive individuals. Recently, several new biomarkers for damage of renal tubular epithelia such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) have been identified. Previously, we found a novel renal biomarker, urinary vanin-1, in several animal models with renal tubular injury. However, there are few studies about early biomarkers of the progression to CKD associated with a high-salt diet. This review presents some new insights about these novel biomarkers for CKD in normotensives and hypertensives under a high salt intake. Interestingly, our recent reports using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) fed a high-salt diet revealed that urinary vanin-1 and NGAL are earlier biomarkers of renal tubular damage in SHR and WKY, whereas urinary Kim-1 is only useful as a biomarker of salt-induced renal injury in SHR.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a dramatic shift to telephone and video consulting for follow up and routine ambulatory care for reasons of infection control. Short Message Service (text) messaging has proved a useful adjunct to remote consulting allowing transfer of photographs and documents. Maintaining non-communicable diseases care is a core component of pandemic preparedness and telemedicine has developed to enable (for example) remote monitoring of sleep apnoea, telemonitoring of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, digital support for asthma self-management, remote delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation. There are multiple exemplars of telehealth instigated rapidly to provide care for people with COVID-19, to manage the spread of the pandemic, or to maintain safe routine diagnostic or treatment services. Despite many positive examples of equivalent functionality and safety, there remain questions about the impact of remote delivery of care on rapport and the longer-term impact on patient/professional relationships. Although telehealth has the potential to contribute to universal health coverage by providing cost-effective accessible care, there is a risk of increasing social health inequalities if the digital divide excludes those most in need of care. As we emerge from the pandemic, the balance of remote versus face-to-face consulting, and the specific role of digital health in different clinical and healthcare contexts will evolve.

The role of diet in the development of a pro-inflammatory state was demonstrated in a recent study that found a high Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII) score was associated with increased concentrations of circulating plasma inflammatory markers. It is becoming increasingly clear that diet and depression are linked, but the relationship itself has not been determined with absolute certainty. Pharmacologic and device assisted therapies are considered our most advanced treatments for major depressive disorder, though numerous studies suggest that they are not sufficient. Exploring the relationship of a pro-inflammatory diet and depressive symptoms is crucial for a holistic, evidenced-based approach to treating depression. METHODS: Our study investigated this association using the EDII to evaluate the inflammatory potential of diet and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to score depression among healthcare personnel. Results from 631 participants were collected for analysis using REDCap software. RESULTS: High PHQ-9 scores and high EDII scores were significantly correlated (F = 18.32, p < 0.0001) even when accounting for gender, psychiatric diagnosis, physical exercise, and spiritual exercise.

Our goal is to inform current and future pandemic response in similar regions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prehospital EMS responses from 22 urban, suburban, and rural EMS agencies in Western Pennsylvania. To account for seasonal variation, we compared demographic, response, and management characteristics for the 2-month period of March 15 to May 15, 2020 with the corresponding 2-month periods in 2016C2019. We then tested for an association between study period (pandemic vs historical control) and incidence of non-transport in unadjusted and adjusted regression. Finally, we described the continuous trends in responses and non-transports that occurred during the year before and initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 103,607 EMS responses in the 2-month comparative periods of March 15 to May 15, 2016C2020, we found a 26.5% [95% CI 26.9%, 27.1%] decrease in responses in 2020 compared to the same months from the four prior years. There was a small increase in respiratory cases (0.6% [95%CI 0.1%, 1.1%]) and greater frequency of abnormal vital signs suggesting a sicker patient cohort.

SUMMARY ANSWER ACE2 protein is highly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells during the secretory phase and is essential for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY ACE2 is expressed in numerous human tissues including the lungs, heart, intestine, kidneys and placenta. ACE2 is also the receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Proliferative (n = 9) and secretory (n = 6) phase endometrium biopsies from healthy reproductive-age women and primary human endometrial stromal cells from proliferative phase endometrium were used in the study. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS ACE2 expression and localization were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in both human endometrial samples and mouse uterine tissue. The effect of ACE2 knockdown on morphological and molecular changes of human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were assessed. Ovariectomized mice were treated with estrogen or progesterone to determine the effects of these hormones on ACE2 expression. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In human tissue, ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA (P < 0.0001) and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA were less able to decidualize than controls, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1 (P < 0.05). In mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced expression of Ace2 mRNA in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen (P < 0.05). LARGE SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Experiments assessing the function of ACE2 in human endometrial stromal cell decidualization were in vitro. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can enter human endometrial stromal cells and affect decidualization have not been assessed. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Expression of ACE2 in the endometrium allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, which could impair in vivo decidualization, embryo implantation, and placentation. If so, women with COVID-19 may be at increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

The literature review includes eight papers reporting single cases or case series of CVA. Moreover, it also addresses, other cutaneous reactions following COVID 19 vaccinations as well as possible differential diagnosis. CVA migrans-like erythema is characterized by a ring-shaped rash in the injection area, which appears some days after the injection and disappears in about 10 days. This reaction may appear more rapidly in subsequent doses.","output":"Erythema Migrans-like COVID Vaccine Arm: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes 1.

Explain key components of a palliative care summer research program for students from UR backgrounds and schools that lack access to palliative care 3. Develop action items to enhance palliative care exposure and training for UR medical students across the United States Many medical schools across the United States lack access to palliative care educational opportunities. This is especially true at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and predominantly Latino-serving institutions that generally are not resource rich. Opportunities for exposure to palliative care during medical school have two purposes. First, it can increase diversity by encouraging students who are underrepresented (UR) to specialize in palliative care. Second, UR physicians are more likely to care for patients who look like them. Therefore, improving palliative care training can enhance the care that UR patients with serious illness receive. Given the shortage of specialty-trained palliative care physicians, providing opportunities to introduce palliative care early in medical training will help to enhance primary palliative care skills for these future physicians. In this concurrent session, we will first discuss the limited options that schools with high numbers of UR students have to obtain palliative care training. Next, we will discuss an innovative palliative care summer research and career development program for medical students from UR backgrounds and schools that lack access to palliative care. In thinking through the program, we will lead a discussion with participants regarding the core knowledge, skills and attitudes that should guide a palliative care summer program for medical students. We will then describe the pilot program we have developed at the University of Pittsburgh and discuss feedback from the initial cohort class. Financial, staff, and other barriers, particularly in the time of COVID, will be shared, with possible solutions.

Multiple new guidelines were proposed and existing models of social, domestic and hospital care altered. Most healthcare systems were largely unprepared for this, and the pandemic has tested their adaptability. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the demographics, presentation, clinical management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral (hip) fractures comparing them to a similar cohort of patients admitted a year earlier. METHODS: This retrospective multi-centre cohort study compared all patients admitted with hip fractures between 1st March and 30th May 2019 (group PC: pre-COVID-19) with hip fracture patients admitted over the same time period during the pandemic in 2020 (group C: COVID-19). The data was obtained from the hospitals' local and National Hip Fracture Databases. Mortality data was checked with the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Primary outcomes were time to theatre, in-patient length of stay and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 580 patients were included (304 group PC, 276 group C). Patient demographics including Charlson Comorbidity Index and Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores were broadly similar across the two cohorts. There was a significant reduction in the percentage of total hip replacements (11 to 5%, p = 0.006) in group C. There was an increase in conservative management (1 to 5%, p = 0.002) in group C. Time to theatre was significantly delayed in group C (43.7 h) vs group PC (34.6 h) (p &#8804; 0.001). The overall length of hospital stay was significantly longer in group PC (16.6 days) vs group C (15 days) (p = 0.025). The 30-day mortality rate in group C was 9.8% compared to 8.2% in group PC (p = 0.746), but for COVID-19 (+) patients, it was significantly higher at 38.2% vs 5.8% in COVID-19 (-) patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest multi-centre comparative cohort study in the literature to date examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of hip fracture patients. Whilst mortality rates were similar in both groups, COVID-19-positive patients were almost seven times more likely to die, reflecting the seriousness of the COVID-19 infection and its sequelae in such elderly, vulnerable patients.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the management and outcomes of patients with proximal femoral fractures: a multi-centre study of 580 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Reductions in suicidal and self-harm presentations to emergency departments (EDs) since COVID-19 indicate changes in help-seeking behaviours, but it is unknown if hospital avoidance equally affects all population groups.

Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycle. Here, we conducted two independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify pan-CoV host factors required for the replication of both endemic and emerging CoVs, including the novel CoV SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including the immunophilin FKBP8, TMEM41B, and MINAR1, were common host factors required for CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin family with the compounds Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A, and the non-immunosuppressive derivative Alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures that resemble the natural site of virus replication.

The self-designed program implements agent-based methodology, with agents representing the inhabitants of Hungary. Six types of social situations with risk of infection were distinguished: household contacts, education, workplace, everyday activities, leisure activities, transportation. Based on their socioeconomic characteristics, agents were clustered in eight activity groups: children under three years;kindergarteners and primary school pupils;high schoolers;university students;commuters;local employees;people between the age of 15-64 and unemployed, economically inactive or in home office;elderly. Each activity group showed different frequency of social contacts in the defined social situations. The programme also took linkages between municipalities into consideration, and in order to simulate intermunicipal ows, the gravity-model was adapted. In order to explore the different possibilities, 12 scenarios were created. The scenarios differ from each other in their base reproduction number, the initial location of the infection, the existence of restrictions, and the time-delay of the restrictions. The unrestricted scenarios draw out the expected exponential growth pattern with six-day duplication. The results indicate that under unrestricted circumstances, workplace contacts have the highest significance in the spread, followed by contacts during education and within households. Under unrestricted scenarios, university students and commuters are the most susceptible to infection. The spread between municipalities shows a hierarchical diffusion pattern, combined with dispersion within commuting zones. At an early stage, the virus shows a tendency for concentration, due to the significance surplus of the largest cities. The results indicate that restrictions successfully limited the hierarchical diffusion of the virus. After the full implementation of restrictions, the effective reproduction number sunk below 1 in every scenario for every activity group. However, the relative signifficance of infections during household contacts increased, which may contribute to an extended epidemic. The probability of scenarios was discussed in light of the official numbers and the H-UNCOVER representative survey. A correlation analysis between the two most likely scenarios and the registered infections was also completed.

Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 3.2%, IQR 1.0-6.4%) and slightly higher in at-risk populations (median 5.4%, IQR 1.5-18.4%). Median seroprevalence varied by WHO Global Burden of Disease region (p < 0.01), from 1.0% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 18.8% in South Asia.

Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18-64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04-1.52). Health care workers had a 1.74x [95% CI: 1.18-2.58] higher risk compared to the general population. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sexes.

Pts received camrelizumab at 200mg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, in combination with apatinib 250 mg orally once a day. The primary endpoint was ORR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the secondary endpoints were safety and RFS. Results: Thirty pts were enrolled from April 2019 to January 2021. Basic characteristics: the mean age was 56.7 years, 22 pts were at stage, 33.3% had an elevated LDH level. Median tumor burden was 45mm (10-187). Gene mutation: Nras 4, cKit 3, Braf 2. Up to January 2021, 27 pts could be evaluated, in which 2 pts got CR, 4 pts achieved PR, and 63% experienced tumor shrinkage. The ORR and DCR were 22.2% and 77.8%, respectively. With a median follow up time of 8.3 months, the median PFS was 8.0 months (95% CI, 3.68, 10.19), the one-year durable response rate was 83.3% and the duration of response time was still not reached. Univariate analysis showed high LDH level was negatively associated with PFS. Whole exome data of baseline tumor biopsies revealed a positive correlation between high copy number variation (CNV) plus high mutational load (TMB) and efficacy, and all of the 4pts with MDC1 gene mutation got tumor shrink and 2 got PR. 96.7% pts experienced treatment-related AEs (TRAEs), including hand foot syndrome in 40%, proteinuria in 40%, liver dysfunction in 36.7%, and hypothyroidism in 30%. The grade 3-4 TRAEs were 33.3%. AE-related permanent discontinuation occurred in only 13.3% pts. 6 pts had delays of treatment due to the COVID-19 epidemic. No dose-limiting toxicities and suspected unexpected AEs were observed in the combination. Conclusions: The combination of apatinib plus camrelizumab was tolerable and showed promising antitumor activities and PFS improvement in pts with treatment-na?ve metastatic acral melanoma. The survival is still in follow up.","output":"Apatinib in combination with camrelizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death-1, in patients with metastatic acral melanoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has had impacts on mango export of farmers and they must have coping strategies to survival. Ban Haet Mango Export Community Enterprise is a leading community enterprise that exports Namdokmai Sithong mango. Since 2007, the enterprise has followed the standards set by the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in four season per year, ensuring high quality of their mangoes fit for sales in export and domestic markets. For exporting, sold premium graded to distributors and export to Japan, South Korea and China. A few premium graded and a graded lower were sold in the domestic market by farmer themselves and via middlemen. However, at the end of the year 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic erupted, which later spread across the globe that heavily affected on the mango market of farmers. The severity of the impact was identified in two phases, the 1st period during 10-24 March 2020 and the 2nd period during 25 March - 31 May 2020. It was found that three main partners have suffered and their coping strategies were divided into the following two periods: (1) Impact on members and their coping strategies;The 1st period, can't sell mangoes and they put on hold the harvesting of the produce and diverted manpower for finding new markets. The 2nd period, coordinate domestic marketing channel support with relevant sectors, they were able to sell some of their produce. (2) Impact on the community enterprise and its coping strategies;The 1st period, the enterprise was not able to gather the produce from the members for distribution. They coordinated marketing channel support with relevant sectors. The 2nd period, they could gather some of the produce with price slashed by forty percent for export and fifty percent for domestic market when compared with previous year. (3) Impact on export distributors and their adjustment. The 1st period, they were heavily impacted being unable to buy the produce from the enterprise for export. They looked for ways to buy the produce and distributed it to the international market. The 2nd period, they were able to purchase some of the produce for export and the mangoes were transported throughout the chartered flights.","output":"Mango and COVID-19: The impact on and coping of Namdokmai Sithong mango export farmers in Khon Kaen, Thailand during the pandemic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia has enough access to freshwater resources of the planet. However, uneven distribution together with mediocre water management and a lack of water infrastructures make a significant number of households in this country have inadequate access to safe water. This becomes big issues, because the provision of safe water, sanitation and hygienic conditions are essential to protect human health and save humanity during the Covid-19 pandemic. When this article was written, COVID-19 patients who were confirmed to be infected were in all Indonesian provinces, with the largest numbers of patients located in Java. The purpose of this study is to determine the efforts of the Indonesian government to fulfill its responsibilities in fulfilling clean water during a pandemic. The study collects all regulations and policies concerning clean water and an analyses them using doctrinal method. The result of the study shows that although there are enough regulations governing the use of clean water, they have not resolved the problem of clean water fulfillment. In overcoming water needs during the pandemic, the Indonesian government did not make additional efforts other than those previously planned in the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. The disruption of the economy has an impact on state finance, causing the government to refocus budgeting. As a result, many programs related to clean water are postponed. This minimum effort by government is neglecting its responsibility in fulfilling the right to water.

Methods: From May until September, 2020, we tested visitors to 20 clinics, for COVID-19 in five neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince as part of a public health effort to determine prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community. In order to estimate changes in number of deaths, the team visited eighteen funeral homes to solicit data on the number of funerals conducted for each month in 2019 and through October 2020. We also sought to evaluate the attitudes of Port-au-Prince citizens towards a generic COVID-19 vaccine in April 2021. Results: In May and July 2020, 11.4% and 9.1% of those tested were positive for antibodies to COVID-19, respectively. The number of funerals held in the Port-au-Prince area increased by 69.6.% (CI 95% 56.1-83.1) since the official arrival of COVID-19 on March 19th.

How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. Methods: We performed meta-analysis and meta regression to analyze the associations of plasma D-dimer with 106 clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis in 14,862 patients of 42 studies. There were no limitations of age, gender, race, and country. Raw data of each group were extracted separately by two investigators. Individual data of case series, median and interquartile range, and ranges of median or mean were converted to SDM (standard deviation of mean). Findings: The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between mild and severe groups, as shown by meta-analysis. Publication bias was significant. Meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels. Of these, 11 readouts were negatively related to the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), bilirubin, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), systolic blood pressure, and CK (creatine kinase). Interpretation: These findings support elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for both mortality and complications. The identified D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and pulmonary hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis, and the D-dimer-associated clinical biomarkers, and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","output":"Associations of D-Dimer on Admission and Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the majority of China, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the county level provides both clinical and public health care for TB cases, with hospitals and other health facilities referring suspected TB cases to the CDC. In recent years, an integrated model has emerged, where the CDC remains the basic management unit for TB control, while a general hospital is designated to provide clinical care for TB patients. This study aims to explore the factors that influence the integration of TB services in general hospitals and generate knowledge to aid the scale-up of integration of TB services in China. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach using interviews from sites in East and West China. Analysis was conducted using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: The more prosperous site in East China was more coordinated and thus had a better method of resource allocation and more patient-orientated service, compared with the poorer site in the West. The development of public health organizations appeared to influence how effectively integration occurred. An understanding from staff that hospitals had better capacity to treat TB patients than CDCs was a strong rationale for integration. However, the economic and political interests might act as a barrier to effective integration. Both sites shared the same challenges of attracting and retaining a skilled workforce for the TB services. The role of the health bureau was more directive in the Western site, while a more participatory and collaborative approach was adopted in the Eastern site. CONCLUSION: The process of integration identifies similarities and differences between sites in more affluent East China and poorer West China. Integration of TB services in the hospitals needs to address the challenges of stakeholder motivations and resource allocation. Effective inter-organizational collaboration could help to improve the efficiency and quality of TB service.

We analyze how the presence of school-aged children influences their parents views about working from home. After controlling for various factors using a fixed effects model, we find that in cases where parents were workers, and the children are (1) in primary school, parents are willing to promote working from home. If children are (2) in junior high school, the parents view is hardly affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose children are primary school pupils are most likely to support promotion of working from home after schools reopen. Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work from home, and this experience motivated workers with small children to continue doing so to improve work-life balance even after schools reopen.","output":"Changing views about remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence using panel data from Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the serum vitamin D levels in neonatal seizures and vitamin D status of the mothers whose babies had vitamin D deficiency.

METHODS: Tightly followed-up adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) performed a video consultation during COVID19 lockdown and repeated the same rheumatology evaluations through a face-to-face visit within 2-weeks. Sensitivity and specificity of virtual visits for treatment decisions (categorized as unchanged, adjusted/escalate, tapered/discontinued, need for further examinations), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for virtually measured disease activity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were calculated with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using face-to-face visits as the reference method. RESULTS: In 89 out of 106 (84.0%) patients, face-to-face visits confirmed the remotely delivered treatment decision. Video-visiting showed excellent sensitivity (94.1% with 95%CI 71.3%-99.9%) and specificity (96.7%; 95%CI 90.8% to 99.3%) in identifying the need for treatment adjustment due to inadequate disease control. The major driver for the low sensitivity of virtual video consultation (55.6%; 95%CI 21.2%-86.3%) in identifying the need for treatment tapering was SLE diagnosis (OR 10.0; 95%CI 3.1-32.3; p < 0.001), mostly because of discordance with face-to-face consultation in glucocorticoid tapering. Remotely evaluated PROs showed high reliability (ICC range 0.80 to 0.95) whilst disease activity measures had less consistent data (ICC range 0.50 to 0.95), especially those requiring more extensive physical examination such as in SLE and PsA. CONCLUSION: Video-visiting proved high reliability in identifying the need for treatment adjustment and might support the IRDs standard tight-control strategy.","output":"Telemedicine in rheumatology: high specificity and sensitivity of follow-up virtual video consultations during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women.

METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional, international, registry-based study. Data were extracted from the International Neuromuscular COVID-19 Database and collected between May 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021. The database included subjects with (1) PMD diagnosis (any age), clinically/histopathologically suspected and/or genetically confirmed; and (2) COVID-19 diagnosis classified as confirmed, probable, or suspected based on World Health Organization definitions. The primary outcome was hospitalization because of COVID-19. We collected demographic information, smoking status, coexisting comorbidities, outcomes after COVID-19 infection, and PMD genotype-phenotype. Baseline status was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS). RESULTS: Seventy-nine subjects with PMDs from 10 countries were included (mean age 41.5  18 years): 25 (32%) were hospitalized, 48 (61%) recovered fully, 28 (35%) improved with sequelae, and 3 (4%) died. Statistically significant differences in hospitalization status were observed in baseline status, including the NMDAS score (p = 0.003) and mRS (p = 0.001), presence of respiratory dysfunction (p < 0.001), neurologic involvement (p = 0.003), and more than 4 comorbidities (p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, respiratory dysfunction was independently associated with COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio, 7.66; 95% CI, 2C28; p = 0.002). DISCUSSION: Respiratory dysfunction is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 in PMDs while high disease burden and coexisting comorbidities contribute toward COVID-19Crelated hospitalization.

Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. This results in part from a failure of central injury to elicit a pro-regenerative response in sensory neurons. However, regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the different regenerative capacities after peripheral or central injury result in part from a lack of response of macrophages, satellite glial cells (SGC) or other non-neuronal cells in the DRG microenvironment remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single cell transcriptional profiling of DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to peripheral and central injuries. Activation of the PPAR signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after nerve injury, did not occur after central injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPAR agonist fenofibrate, increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries.","output":"Profiling sensory neuron microenvironment after peripheral and central axon injury reveals key pathways for axon regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Findings reveal a strong correlation between physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness, the nervous system, psycho-motor skills, vascular aging, mood, cognition, and the overall quality of life as a result of a regular non-pharmacological treatment.

METHODS: Altogether, 69,571 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes collected globally within the first six months of pandemic were examined. The correlation between variant replacement and containment capacity was examined by logistic regression models using the WHO International Health Regulation (IHR) score, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) and the vulnerability index INFORM as proxies; whereas correlation with changes in monthly crude case-fatality ratios was examined by a mixed effect model. RESULTS: At the global level, variant lineage G* characterized by the S-D614G mutation replaced the older lineages L and S in March 2020. European countries including Finland, France and Italy were the first group to reach 50% increment of G*, whereas only Singapore and South Korea had non-G* persisted throughout the first six months. Countries with higher IHR scores (-coefficient: -0.001, 95% C.I. [-0.016, -0.001], p=0.034) and higher stringency indexes (OxCGRT) (-coefficient: -0.011, 95% C.I. [-0.020, -0.001], p=0.035) were associated with lower levels of G* replacement; whereas higher vulnerability indexes (INFORM) (-coefficient: 0.049, 95% C.I.

Climate projections indicate that temperatures in the southern interior of BC will continue to increase, with concomitant negative impacts on human health. Successful climate change adaptation must include cross-sectoral action, inclusive of the health sector, to plan for and respond to climate-related events, including extreme heat. INTERVENTION: The objective of this project was to support the development and implementation of a Heat Alert and Response System (HARS) in a small, rural community. The health authority facilitated collaboration among provincial and local governments, community organizations, and First Nations partners to assess community assets, draft a plan for extreme heat, and prepare for a community-supported response during heat events. OUTCOMES: Stakeholders expressed the importance of utilizing existing partnerships and community resources, such as physical and procedural infrastructure, in which to embed the HARS. It was imperative that the plan be simple, concise, and considerate of the communitys unique context. Educational materials and a tailored method of dissemination were important for collective and individual risk mitigation. IMPLICATIONS: A community-driven approach that utilized existing assets allowed for integration of HARS within municipal response plans and established infrastructure. The result is a sustainable public health intervention that has the potential to mitigate the negative health effects of extreme heat.

Epidemiological evidence reports positive associations between BC and cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Despite this, BC is currently not regulated by the EU Air Quality Directive, and as a result BC data are not available in urban areas from reference air quality monitoring networks in many countries. To fill this gap, a machine learning approach is proposed to develop a BC proxy using air pollution datasets as an input. The proposed BC proxy is based on two machine learning models, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), using observations of particle mass and number concentrations (N), gaseous pollutants and meteorological variables as the input. Experimental data were collected from a reference station in Barcelona (Spain) over a 2-year period (2018-2019). Two months of additional data were available from a second urban site in Barcelona, for model validation. BC concentrations estimated by SVR showed a high degree of correlation with the measured BC concentrations (R2 = 0.828) with a relatively low error (RMSE = 0.48 g/m3). Model performance was dependent on seasonality and time of the day, due to the influence of new particle formation events. When validated at the second station, performance indicators decreased (R2 = 0.633; RMSE = 1.19 g/m3) due to the lack of N data and PM2.5 and the smaller size of the dataset (2 months). New particle formation events critically impacted model performance, suggesting that its application would be optimal in environments where traffic is the main source of ultrafine particles. Due to its flexibility, it is concluded that the model can act as a BC proxy, even based on EU-regulatory air quality parameters only, to complement experimental measurements for exposure assessment in urban areas.","output":"Non-linear models for black carbon exposure modelling using air pollution datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous reports have described worsening inequalities of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding of principal investigators.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in patients younger than 18 years of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer diagnoses between April and September 2020. Demographic variables, laboratory, and radiologic findings and complications of each case were identified. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were identified; the median age was 10 years. Fifteen patients (42%) were in chemotherapy at the time of the infection diagnosis, in two patients the chemotherapy protocol was permanently suspended. The most common symptom was fever in 20 patients (60%). Seven patients (21.2%) showed mild pneumonia, four patients (12.1%) severe pneumonia, and three cases (9.0%) were classified as critical. In the evaluated cohort, five patients (15.1%) died, and in two of those, death was caused by COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an oncologic disease, the search for COVID cases should be oriented to patients with fever, including febrile neutropenia, the presence of respiratory symptoms, and the search for epidemiologic contact. A higher frequency of complications and mortality attributed to COVID-19, two in pediatric oncohematologic patients was found.

In fact, as the prevalence of COVID-19 decreases, this RT-PCR testing remains as the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results can lead to misdiagnoses in the clinic. These inconsistencies are due to the variability in (1) the collection times of biological samples post infection, and (2) sampling procedures. METHODS: We applied the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate logistic regression on RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the proportion (%) of negative conversion among patients who had tested twice or more, and compared the proportions arising from oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and combined double testing, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% on day 4, 16.4% on day 7, 41.0% at 2 weeks, and 61.0% at 3 weeks post-admission. We also found that 34.1% and 60.3% of subjects had at least one negative RT-PCR result on days 7 and 14 after the onset of symptoms, respectively. The proportion of negative conversions following sputum testing was higher than that from oropharyngeal swabs in the early stages but this declined after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical if we are to control the COVID-19 epidemic. According to this study, early, consecutive and combined double testing, will be the key to identify infected patients, particularly for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. These strategies will minimize misdiagnosis and the ineffective isolation of infected patients.","output":"Early and consecutive RT-PCR tests with both oropharyngeal swabs and sputum could improve testing yield for patients with COVID-19: An observation cohort study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there were several barriers to treatment access and medication adherence in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

This multi-centre study initiated by the Egyptian College of Rheumatology (ECR) was conducted on 1037 RA patients attending rheumatology clinics from 10 governorates. The questionnaire provided covered socio-demographic data, health/disease status, information/knowledge about COVID-19 and medical/family history of the infection. Patients mean age was 44.2  12.3 years;855 females and 182 males; 539(52%) from rural and 497(48%) from urban areas. 41.8% reported a striking difficulty to obtain hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic. The majority (70%) considered maintaining a regular visit to the rheumatologist in addition to remote contact mainly by phone (44.4%) or via WhatsApp (33.1%), in particular among male and urban patients. Urban patients were more likely to be infected by COVID-19 (12.9% vs 6.2%; p < 0.0001) than rural. Northern cities had more patients with suspected COVID-19 (13.9% vs 6.1%; p < 0.0001); was significantly associated with more disease flares (30.8% vs 5.8%) with subsequent change in the RA treatment (20.9% vs 6.4%; p < 0.0001).

Clinical and experimental studies aimed at depicting a potential \\"immune signature\\" of SARS-COV-2, identified three main \\"actors,\\" namely the cytokine IL-6, the chemokine CXCL10 and the infiltrating immune cell type macrophages. Although other cytokines, chemokines and infiltrating immune cells are deeply involved and their role should not be neglected, based on currently available data, IL-6, CXCL10, and infiltrating macrophages could be considered prototype factors representing each component of the immune system. It rapidly became clear that a strong and continuous interplay among the three components of the immune response is mandatory in order to produce a severe clinical course of the disease. Indeed, while IL-6, CXCL10 and macrophages alone would not be able to fully drive the onset and maintenance of the cytokine-storm, the establishment of a IL-6/CXCL10/macrophages axis is crucial in driving the sequence of events characterizing this condition.

In our previous studies, we investigated the anti-amyloidogenic effects of three different aroma-producing (volatile) compounds including cinnamaldehyde, phenyl ethyl alcohol, and TEMED on the fibrillation process of HEWL, as a model protein. Our previous results showed that while TEMED was able to completely stop the process of fibril formation, cinnamaldehyde and phenyl ethyl alcohol gave rise to oligomeric/protofibrillar forms and were involved in the entrapment of intermediate species of HEWL. In this study, we investigated the anti-amyloidogenic effect of the same three volatile compounds on recombinantly produced tau and -synuclein proteins. Methods: The thioflavin T fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, SDS-PAGE/native-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy were used, where necessary, to further our understanding of the inhibitory effects of the three volatile compounds on the fibril formation of tau and -synuclein proteins and allow for a comparison with previous data obtained for HEWL. Results: Our results revealed that contrary to the results obtained for HEWL (a globular protein), the volatile compound TEMED was no longer able to prevent fibril formation in either of the natively unstructured tau or -synuclein proteins, and instead, cinnamaldehye and phenyl ethyl alcohol, in particular, had the role of preventing fibril formation of tau or -synuclein. Conclusion: The results of this study further emphasized the exclusion of HEWL as a model protein for fibrillation studies and highlighted the importance of studying brain-related proteins such as tau or -synuclein and the need to assess the effects of volatile compounds such as cinnamaldehye and phenyl ethyl alcohol as potential substances in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","output":"Unravelling the Novel Effects of Three Volatile Compounds in Preventing Fibril Formation of Disease Related Tau and -Synuclein Proteins- Towards Identifying Candidate Aromatic Substances for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To demonstrate the utilisation of a risk assessment protocol designed to prioritise elective neurosurgical patients against the risks of COVID-19.

Almost 20years ago, an essay by Sitia and Meldolesi first listed what was known at the time about domain formation within the ER. In the time that has passed since, additional ER domains have been discovered and characterized. These include the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the ER quality control compartment (ERQC), where ER-associated degradation (ERAD) occurs, and the plasma membrane-associated membrane (PAM). Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the ER. Research has also shown that the biogenesis of peroxisomes and lipid droplets occurs on specialized membranes of the ER. Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these domains and how they are targeted there. Moreover, a first set of cytosolic ER-associated sorting proteins, including phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2) and Rab32 have been identified. Intra-ER targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto ER retention mechanisms and rely on transmembrane and cytosolic sequences. The crucial roles of ER domain formation for cell physiology are highlighted with the specific targeting of the tumor metastasis regulator gp78 to ERAD-mediating membranes or of the promyelocytic leukemia protein to the MAM.","output":"Urban planning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): How diverse mechanisms segregate the many functions of the ER"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of unexplained pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019.

In this work, we investigated the activation pathways and free energy landscape of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and compared with those of the closely related counterpart SARS-CoV using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results revealed a large difference between the activation pathways of the two S-proteins. The transition from inactive to an active state for the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more cooperative, involving simultaneous disruptions of several key interfacial hydrogen bonds, and the transition encounters a much higher free energy barrier.

The disease in its ever-evolving course is exhibiting a myriad of symptoms and imaging manifestations. This retrospective study was conducted to generate evidence from the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to aid in the diagnosis and disease management. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 disease who underwent chest CT between 1(st) June to 31(st) December 2020 at a tertiary care institute of North India. Anonymized data of 152 COVID-19 positive patients was used for the evaluation of the clinical profile and imaging findings. RESULTS: The common presenting clinical symptoms were fever, cough, myalgia and sore throat. The most frequent CT imaging feature consisted of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation and crazy paving distributed bilaterally, peripherally in subpleural location with a predilection for the posterior parts of lungs. Reverse halo sign was observed in 12 patients and halo sign in 3 patients. Dilated pulmonary vessels with mild bronchiolectasis were observed in the involved lung parenchyma. Less common findings included pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pericardial effusion. The mean CT severity score gradually increased with increasing age. CONCLUSION: The predominant imaging finding of COVID-19 pneumonia was peripheral GGO's distributed bilaterally in peripheral subpleural region and having predilection for the posterior parts of the lungs which gradually evolve into organizing pneumonia patterns. Although COVID-19 shares imaging findings with other viral pneumonias, however in the context of the current pandemic, we must keep COVID-19 a differential diagnosis, in all patients with fever and respiratory symptoms.","output":"High-resolution chest computed tomography findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) C A retrospective single center study of 152 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shift to digital classrooms due to the COVID-19 pandemic has raised many challenges for educators regarding student participation, engagement and social interactions, and our CM1121 introductory organic chemistry course was no exception to these disruptions.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, correlates and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 671 critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China between January 1 to February 29, 2020. Data were captured on demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, acute physiology, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary exposure was ICU admission for confirmed COVID-19 related critically illness. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with AKI, organ dysfunction, treatment intensity, and health services use. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 671 severe COVID-19 patients (median [IQR] 65 [56-73] years; male sex 65% (n = 434); hypertension 43% (n = 287) and APACHE II score 10 [7-14]), 39% developed AKI. Patients with AKI were older, had greater markers of inflammation and coagulation activation, and had greater acuity and organ dysfunction as presentation. Despite similar treatment with antivirals, patients with AKI had lower viral conversion negative rates than those without AKI. The 28-day mortality was much higher in AKI patients than patients without AKI (72% vs. 42%), and there was an increase in 28-day mortality according to the severity of AKI. Non-survivors were less likely to receive antiviral therapy [132 (70%) vs. 65 (88%)] compared with survivors and have lower viral negative conversion rate [17 (9%) vs. 47 (64%)].

As one of the most versatile and amenable specimen options, saliva offers great advantages for widespread screening strategies due to its non-invasive properties, cost-effectiveness, excellent stability and minimal risk of cross-infection. This review attempts to outline the scientific rationale for detection of SARS-COV-2 in saliva specimens. By combining the data obtained from ten chosen published clinical studies, we calculated the pooled sensitivity and specificity using an online calculator. Through evidence, we established that SARS-COV-2 is detectable in saliva with a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity (87%) and specificity (98%). We also presented a review of emerging technologies approved by the FDA for detection of SARS-COV-2 in oral fluids (saliva and sputum) using polymerase chain reaction methods. Given the challenges involved in obtaining invasive specimens from the naso- and oropharynx, saliva can serve as an easy to collect diagnostic specimen for screening in the work environment, schools and for home testing.

OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this quality improvement project was to increase the number of COVID-19 tests carried out in one of the participating sites, Glasgow Dental Hospital and School. The secondary aim was to identify barriers to patient participation and staff engagement when implementing a public health initiative in an outpatient setting. METHOD: A quality improvement working group met weekly to discuss hospital findings, identify drivers and change ideas. Details on reasons for patient non-participation were recorded and questionnaires on project barriers were distributed to staff. In response to findings, rapid interventions were implemented to fast-track increases in the numbers of tests being carried out. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks, 972 tests were carried out by Glasgow Dental Hospital and School Secondary Care Services. The number of tests per week increased from 19 (week 1) to 129 (week 16). This compares to a similar control site, where the number of tests carried out remained unchanged; 38 (week 1) to 36 (week 16). The most frequent reason given for non-participation was fear that the swab would hurt. For staff, lack of time and forgetting to ask patients were identified as the most significant barriers. CONCLUSION: Public health surveillance programmes can be integrated rapidly into outpatient settings. This project has shown that a quality improvement approach can be successful in integrating such programmes.

However, little is known about mental health problems during a low-incidence period of the pandemic without strict public health measures. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate whether COVID-19Crelated risk factors for mental health problems persist beyond lockdown measures. We targeted a vulnerable population that is at risk of developing low mental health and assessed their daily dynamics of mood and emotion regulation after a strict lockdown. METHODS: During a postlockdown period in Germany (between August 8, 2020, and November 1, 2020), we conducted an ecological momentary assessment with 131 participants who experienced at least mild COVID-19Crelated distress and loneliness. To estimate negative mood inertia, we built a lag-1 three-level autoregressive model. RESULTS: We found that information exposure and active daily COVID-19 cases did not have an impact on negative mood amid a postlockdown period. However, there was a day-to-day carryover effect of negative mood. In addition, worrying about COVID-19, feeling restricted by COVID-19, and feeling lonely increased negative mood.

Longevity is associated with healthy food intake, and consumers want to be aware of the nature of the molecules present in their food or, even better, of the molecules contributing to the enrichment of their food. Furthermore, the use of industrial food processes that tend to protect the environment are a further factor that contributes to the consumers interest. ABSTRACT: The aim of the present work is the characterization of biscuit doughs enriched with pomegranate peel powder (PPP) at 3 (PPP3) and 5 (PPP5) wt% in the prospect of developing a fortified aliment as a support of the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract. The total phenolic content of the powder was preliminarily evaluated. Then, the main compounds present in the PPP were identified by HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS analysis, being mainly hydrolysable tannins. The PPP was then treated at 180 C for 20 min to mimic the baking treatment, and its water-soluble fraction (PPPwsf) was then added in the Caco-2 cell culture as a model of the intestinal epithelial barrier to verify its dose-dependent toxicity, ability in counteracting the oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory action. Rheological experiments were performed to predict the macroscopic behavior of the PPP-added doughs during lamination and biscuit baking. SEM investigations gave their contribution to the microscopic comprehension of the dough structure. Finally, a consumer panel composed by thirty volunteers was enrolled to express its opinion on the sensory agreeableness of the biscuits prepared with two different concentrations of PPP compared with the reference dough. The discussion is focused on the biological effects of the main components found in the PPP.","output":"Recovery from Food WasteBiscuit Doughs Enriched with Pomegranate Peel Powder as a Model of Fortified Aliment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered life globally during the first 4 months of 2020. Many countries, including the United States, responded to the pandemic by issuing stay-at-home orders/shelter-in-place orders (SaHOs/SiPOs) to their citizens. By April 2020, more than 90% of the U.S. population was subject to an order. SaHOs/SiPOs raise a number of complex issues for the police, ranging from concerns about infringement of constitutional rights to potential sanctions for violations of an order. This article delves into the issues surrounding SaHOs/SiPOs and highlights their complexity for the police. First, we examine the why the police? question, and point to key features of their role which make enforcement of SaHOs/SiPOs the proper business of the police. Second, we examine the relevant legal doctrines that can serve as the basis for police actions against violators of orders, most notably the special needs doctrine.

As the public health situation evolves, it is important to evaluate provider satisfaction with virtual care during these unprecedented times. AIMS: To assess healthcare provider (HCP) satisfaction with virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We administered a 20-item satisfaction survey that assessed the usefulness, ease of use, interface qualities, reliability, and overall satisfaction with virtual care tools for the delivery of care to patients with gastrointestinal diseases. One hundred and twenty-five gastroenterologists in Alberta were invited to participate via email. We used a modified Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) which was open for response from June 19-August 30, 2020. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 19% (24/125) with 46% female respondents. Most respondents worked in an academic facility (63%) and had been in practice for a mean duration of 12.3 years. Respondents were from seven facilities within the South, Calgary, Central and Edmonton health zones. Virtual care reported was a hybrid model consisting of telephone and in-person (54%) or telephone and video consults (42%). Although 90% indicated that virtual care tools improved access to healthcare, provided location flexibility and were appropriate to meet healthcare needs, only 42% agreed that it saved time. Inconclusive virtual consultations due to the absence of physical examination and missing lab values was reported by 75% and 33% of HCPs, respectively. Ninety-five percent of HCPs who used video conferencing found it simple, easy to learn and were able to become productive quickly with it. Over 60% of HCPs reported that virtual care (irrespective of the platform used) was not the same as in-person visits. The mean overall satisfaction for HCPs who rarely or never had virtual care prior to the pandemic, was 0.57 points higher than those who often provided virtual care (4.36 vs 3.79; 95% CI: 0.26C0.88, p=0.001). Overall, 88% of providers were satisfied with virtual care and all respondents were willing to use it again (Figure 1). Identified areas of concern included patient safety, patient education on best practices, adequate remuneration, additional administrative duties, and challenges with providing care for new patients on virtual platforms. CONCLUSIONS: This survey of GI providers in Alberta showed high satisfaction and acceptance with virtual care. However, the majority reported it to be less reliable than in-person visits.

The disease starts in the lattice with three possible initial distribution patterns of infected and infection-free sites, viz., infected core patches (ICP), infected peripheral patches (IPP), and randomly distributed infected patches (RDIP). Our results show that infection spreads monotonically in the lattice with increasing migration without showing any sign of recovery in the ICP case. In the IPP case, it follows a similar monotonic progression with increasing migration; however, a self-organized healing process starts for higher migration, leading the lattice to full recovery at a critical rate of migration. Encouragingly, for the initial RDIP arrangement, chances of recovery are much higher with a lower rate of critical migration. An eigenvalue-based semianalytical study is made to determine the critical migration rate for realizing a stable infection-free lattice. The initial fraction of infected patches and the force of infection play significant roles in the self-organized recovery. They follow an exponential law, for the RDIP case, that governs the recovery process. For the frustrating case of ICP arrangement, we propose a random rewiring of links in the lattice allowing long-distance migratory paths that effectively initiate a recovery process. Global prevalence of infection thereby declines and progressively improves with the rewiring probability that follows a power law with the critical migration and leads to the birth of emergent infection-free networks.","output":"Infection spreading and recovery in a square lattice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background How SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted is of key public health importance.

We found that the counties could be clustered into three groups based on (a) the case totals, (b) the total number of deaths, (c) the time course of the cases and (d) the time course of the deaths. The four groupings were very similar to one another and could all be largely explained by the county population, the percentage of low-income population, and the distance of the county from New York.

We assessed several inhibitors of the enzymes pertaining to sphingolipid metabolism, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)-mediated cell-cell fusion and viral infection. N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), an inhibitor of dihydroceramide &#916;4-desaturase 1 (DES1), suppressed cell-cell fusion, and viral infection. The analysis of sphingolipid levels revealed that the inhibition efficiencies of cell-cell fusion and viral infection in 4-HPR-treated cells were consistent with an increased ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to total sphingolipids. We investigated the relationship of DES1 with the inhibition efficiencies of cell-cell fusion. The changes in the sphingolipid profile induced by 4-HPR were mitigated by the supplementation with exogenous cell-permeable ceramide; however, the reduced cell-cell fusion could not be reversed. The efficiency of cell-cell fusion in DES1 knockout (KO) cells was at a level comparable to that in wild-type (WT) cells; however, the ratio of saturated sphinganine-based lipids to the total sphingolipids was higher in DES1 KO cells, compared to that in WT cells. 4-HPR reduced cell membrane fluidity without any significant effects on the expression or localization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Therefore, 4-HPR suppresses SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion through a DES1-independent mechanism, and this decrease in membrane fluidity induced by 4-HPR could be the major cause for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importance Sphingolipids could play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 S-meditated membrane fusion with host cells. We studied the cell-cell fusion using SARS-CoV-2 S expressing cells and sphingolipid-manipulated target cells, with an inhibitor of the sphingolipid metabolism. 4-HPR (also known as fenretinide) is an inhibitor of DES1 and it exhibits antitumor activity and suppresses cell-cell fusion and viral infection. 4-HPR suppresses membrane fusion through a decrease in membrane fluidity, which could possibly be the cause for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is accumulating clinical data on the safety of 4-HPR.

Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are acutely activated by caloric need, and this acute activation promotes increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure. On a longer timescale, AgRP neurons exhibit chronic hyperactivity under conditions of obesity and high dietary fat consumption, likely due to leptin resistance; however, the behavioral and metabolic effects of chronic AgRP neuronal hyperactivity remain unexplored. Here, we use chemogenetics to manipulate Gq signaling in AgRP neurons in mice to explore the hypothesis that chronic activation of AgRP neurons promotes obesity. Inducing chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons initially increased food intake and caused dramatic weight gain, in agreement with published data; however, food intake returned to baseline levels within 1 wk, and body weight returned to baseline levels within 60 d. Additionally, we found that, when mice had elevated body weight due to chronic Gq signaling in AgRP neurons, energy expenditure was not altered but adiposity and lipid metabolism were both increased, even under caloric restriction.

Methods: We outline the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the GI tract, the effects of the virus on the gut and liver, the presence of the virus in stool samples, and the potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Most of the literature sources used in this paper are case studies from China following the surge of COVID-19 infection. Results: In patients with COVID-19, GI symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain have presented in conjunction with respiratory symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Evidence also shows acute hepatocellular injury, indicated by elevated liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 is suspected because of the presence of COVID-19 RNA in stool samples of COVID-19Cpositive patients. Conclusion: Even without the presence of respiratory symptoms, several GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 infection, as well as possible fecal-oral transmission. Therefore, COVID-19 infection should be considered for patients presenting with primarily GI symptoms.","output":"Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19: A Review of What We Know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: Previously constructed classifiers in predicting eukaryotic essential genes integrated a variety of features including experimental ones. If we can obtain satisfactory prediction using only nucleotide (sequence) information, it would be more promising. Three groups recently identified essential genes in human cancer cell lines using wet experiments and it provided wonderful opportunity to accomplish our idea. Here we improved the Z curve method into the -interval form to denote nucleotide composition and association information and used it to construct the SVM classifying model. RESULTS: Our model accurately predicted human gene essentiality with an AUC higher than 0.88 both for 5-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. We re-predicted the negative dataset by our Pheg server and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential. Among them, 20 were found to be homologues in mouse essential genes, indicating that some of the 118 genes were indeed essential, however previous experiments overlooked them. As the first available server, Pheg could predict essentiality for anonymous gene sequences of human. It is also hoped the -interval Z curve method could be effectively extended to classification issues of other DNA elements.

This task is challenged by reporting delays that give rise to occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. If these events are not taken into consideration, this can lead to an under-estimation of the counts-to-be-reported and, hence, introduces misconceptions by the interpreter, the media or the general public -- as has been seen for example for reported fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowcasting methods provide close to real-time estimates of the complete number of events using the incomplete time-series of currently reported events by using information about the reporting delays from the past. In this report, we consider nowcasting the number of COVID-19 related fatalities in Sweden. We propose a flexible Bayesian approach that considers temporal changes in the reporting delay distribution and, as an extension to existing nowcasting methods, incorporates a regression component for the (lagged) time-series of the number of ICU admissions. This results in a model considering both the past behavior of the time-series of fatalities as well as additional data streams that are in a time-lagged association with the number of fatalities.","output":"Flexible Bayesian Nowcasting with application to COVID-19 fatalities in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While studies have examined the impact of digital communication technology on healthcare, there is little exploration of how new models of digital care change the roles and identities of the health professional and patient. The purpose of the current study is to generate multidisciplinary reflections and questions around the use of digital consulting and the way it changes the meaning of being a patient and/or a health professional. METHOD: We used a large pre-existing qualitative dataset from the Long-term Conditions Young People Networked Communication (LYNC) study which involved interviews with healthcare professionals and a group of 16C24 years patients with long-term physical and mental health conditions. We conducted a three-stage mixed methods analysis. First, using a small sample of interview data from the LYNC study, we identified three key themes to explore in the data and relevant academic literature. Second, in small groups we conducted secondary analysis of samples of patient and health professional LYNC interview data. Third, we ran a series of rapid evidence reviews. FINDINGS: We identified three key themes: workload/flow, impact of increased access to healthcare and vulnerabilities. Both health professionals and patients were 'on duty' in their role more often. Increased access to healthcare introduced more responsibilities to both patients and health professionals. Traditional concepts in medical ethics, confidentiality, empathy, empowerment/power, efficiency and mutual responsibilities are reframed in the context of digital consulting. CONCLUSIONS: Our collaboration identified conflicts and constraints in the construction of digital patients and digital clinicians. There is evidence that digital technologies change the nature of a medical consultation and with it the identities and the roles of clinicians and patients which, in turn, calls for a redefinition of traditional concepts of medical ethics. Overall, digital consulting has the potential to significantly reduce costs while maintaining or improving patient care and clinical outcomes. Timely study of digital engagement in the National Health Service is a matter of critical importance.","output":"How does the use of digital consulting change the meaning of being a patient and/or a health professional?

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential beneficial effects of licorice intake to protect RBCs from dapsone hydroxylamine (DDS-NHOH), a harmful metabolite of dapsone, commonly used in the treatment of many diseases. A control group (CG, n = 12) and a patient group (PG, n = 18) were treated with licorice extract (25 mg/day), for a week. Blood samples before (T(0)) and after (T(1)) treatment were analyzed for: i) band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and high molecular weight aggregates; and ii) glutathionylation and carbonic anhydrase activity, in the presence or absence of adjunctive oxidative stress induced by DDS-NHOH. Results were correlated with plasma glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) concentrations, measured by HPLCCMS. Results showed that licorice intake decreased the level of DDS-NHOH-related oxidative alterations in RBCs, and the reduction was directly correlated with plasma GA concentration. In conclusion, in PG, the inability to counteract oxidative stress is a serious concern in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches. GA, by protecting RBC from oxidative assault, as in dapsone therapy, might be considered as a new potential tool for preventing further switching into severe endometriosis.","output":"Endometriosis Susceptibility to Dapsone-Hydroxylamine-Induced Alterations Can Be Prevented by Licorice Intake: In Vivo and In Vitro Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of bromhexine at a dose of 8 mg 4 times a day and spironolactone 50 mg per day in patients with mild and moderate COVID 19 Material and methods It was an open, prospective comparative non-randomized study 103 patients were included (33 in the bromhexine and spironolactone group and 70 in the control group) All patients had a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection (COVID 19) based on a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA and/or a typical pattern of viral pneumonia on multispiral computed tomography The severity of lung damage was limited to stage I-II, the level of CRP should not exceed 60 mg / dL and SO2 in the air within 92-98% The duration of treatment is 10 days Results The decrease in scores on the SHOKS-COVID scale, which, in addition to assessing the clinical status, the dynamics of CRP (a marker of inflammation), D-dimer (a marker of thrombus formation), and the degree of lung damage on CT (primary endpoint) was statistically significant in both groups and differences between them was not identified Analysis for the group as a whole revealed a statistically significant reduction in hospitalization time from 10 4 to 9 0 days (by 1 5 days, p=0 033) and fever time from 6 5 to 3 9 days (by 2 5 days, p&lt;0 001) Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 66 patients who were match with using propensity score matching In matched patients, temperature normalization in the bromhexine/spironolactone group occurred 2 days faster than in the control group (p=0 008) Virus elimination by the 10th day was recorded in all patients in the bromhexine/spironolactone group;the control group viremia continued in 23 3% (p=0 077) The number of patients who had a positive PCR to the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the 10th day of hospitalization or longer (10 days) hospitalization in the control group was 20/21 (95 2%), and in the group with bromhexine /spironolactone -14/24 (58 3%), p=0 012 The odds ratio of having a positive PCR or more than ten days of hospitalization was 0 07 (95% CI: 0 008 - 0 61, p=0 0161) with bromhexine and spironolactone versus controls No side effects were reported in the study group Conclusion The combination of bromhexine with spironolactone appeared effective in treating a new coronavirus infection by achieving a faster normalization of the clinical condition, lowering the temperature one and a half times faster, and reducing explanatory combine endpoint the viral load or long duration of hospitalization ( 10 days)","output":"[Results of Open-Label non-Randomized Comparative Clinical Trial: \\"BromhexIne and Spironolactone for CoronvirUs Infection requiring hospiTalization (BISCUIT)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is a type II C-type lectin whose expression is restricted to the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs), the dendritic cells (DCs).

Besides being an adhesion molecule, particularly in binding ICAM-2 and ICAM-3, it is also crucial in recognizing several endogenous and exogenous antigens. Additionally, the intracellular domain of DC-SIGN includes molecular motifs, which enable the activation of signal transduction pathways involving Raf-1 and subsequent modulation of DC-maturation status, through direct modification of nuclear factor Nf-B in DCs. Upon DC-SIGN engagement by mannose- or fucose-containing oligosaccharides, the latter leads to a tailored Toll-like receptor signalling, resulting in an altered DC-cytokine profile and skewing of Th1/Th2 responses.

The prognosis for rapid deterioration after the cesarean delivery is difficult to assess and needs close interdisciplinary follow-up due to pregnancy and postpartum-related changes. Materials and Methods: We report the case of a 37-year-old primigesta primipara patient who was admitted to Elena Doamna Clinical Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology at 33 weeks and 3 days of gestation with high-grade multiple pregnancies (triplets) for threatened premature birth associated with COVID-19. The patient had a history of surgically corrected atrial septal defect during childhood and currently is known to have paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Tocolysis was ineffective and the decision to perform a cesarean operation was made. The diagnosis was established: primigesta, primipara, at 34 weeks of gestation, high-grade multiple pregnancy with triplets, intact membranes, threatened premature birth, surgically corrected atrial septal defect, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, infection with COVID-19. The patient underwent a cesarean intervention and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. The intervention took place at 33 weeks and 4 days of gestation resulting in four newborns with weights between 1400 g and 1820 g and Apgar scores between 6C8. All newborns were transferred to a third-degree Neonatology ICU service due to their prematurity. The fourth newborn was not identified in any of the ultrasounds performed during pregnancy. During the postpartum period, the patient had a fulminant evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia, with rapid deterioration, needing respiratory support and antiviral treatment. Discussions: Managing high-risk obstetrical pregnancies associated with COVID-19 requires a multidisciplinary team consisting of obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, and infectious disease doctors. Conclusion: Our case is the first to our knowledge in Romania to present an association of high-grade multiple pregancy with COVID19 moderate form, rapidly evolving postpartum, needing rapid intensive care admission, and specific treatment with Remdesivir, with good post-treatment evolution.","output":"The Rare Case of a COVID-19 Pregnant Patient with Quadruplets and Postpartum Severe Pneumonia.

We aimed to investigate effects of this multi-layered shock on production, sales, prices, incomes and diets for vegetable farmers in India as both producers and consumers of nutrient-dense foods. We undertook a rapid telephone survey with 448 farmers in 4 states, in one of the first studies to document the early impacts of the pandemic and policy responses on farming households. We find that a majority of farmers report negative impacts on production, sales, prices and incomes. Over 80% of farms reported some decline in sales, and over 20% of farms reported devastating declines (sold almost nothing). Price reductions were reported by over 80% of farmers, and reductions by more than half for 50% of farmers. Similarly, farm income reportedly dropped for 90% of farms, and by more than half for 60%. Of surveyed households, 62% reported disruptions to their diets. A majority of farm households reported reduced ability to access the most nutrient-dense foods. Around 80% of households reported ability to protect their staple food consumption, and the largest falls in consumption were in fruit and animal source foods other than dairy, in around half of households. Reported vegetable consumption fell in almost 30% of households, but vegetables were also the only food group where consumption increased for some, in around 15% of households. Our data suggest higher vulnerability of female farmers in terms of both livelihoods and diet, and differential effects on smaller and larger farms, meaning different farms may require different types of support in order to continue to function. Farms reported diverse coping strategies to maintain sales, though often with negative implications for reported incomes. The ability to consume ones own produce may be somewhat protective of diets when other routes to food access fail. The impacts of COVID-19 and subsequent policy responses on both livelihoods and diets in horticultural households risk rolling back the impressive economic and nutrition gains India has seen over the past decade. Food systems, and particularly those making available the most nutrient-dense foods, must be considered in ongoing and future government responses.","output":"Food system disruption: initial livelihood and dietary effects of COVID-19 on vegetable producers in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The socio-professional condition of journalists has undergone profound changes over the past few decades. These result from a succession of crises that have affected the media in the context of a combined process of liberalization and digitalization. In addition to changes in production routines, newsrooms underwent restructuring operations, responsible for the recomposition of their workforce. Between collective redundancies, increased unemployment, fixed-term contracts, green receipts, discontinuous and intermittent forms of work, low wages, free work and low cost of interns, precariousness began, step by step, to characterize the journalistic condition. Based on the results of the Study on the Effects of the State of Emergency on Journalism in the Context of Pandemic Covid-19, this article aims to analyse the implications of these policies on journalists employment relations. The main objective is to understand to what extent media companies response to this new reality represents a setback of the logic behind precariousness or, on the contrary, its acceleration. The study aims, firstly, to produce a diagnosis on employment relationships before the state of emergency declaration (SED)  between March and April 2020 , namely the incidence of temporary modalities and their relationship with factors such as gender or age. At a second step, the consequences of SED at this level will be analysed, mainly with regard to the use of temporary contracts, dismissals or lay-offs. ? 2021.

We aimed to critically report the characteristics of all the registered and published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted on COVID-19, and summarize the evaluation of potential therapies developed in various regions. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Clinicaltrial.gov databases to retrieve all the relevant studies up to July 19, 2021, in conformity with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart. We included all English-language published/registered RCTs on COVID-19, and excluded non-RCT, in-vitro/in-vivo, editorials, and review studies. Two reviewers independently evaluated all the records, and then analyzed by using SPSS 17. RESULTS: Within 3018 included studies, 2801 (92.8%) and 217 (7.2%) were registered or published RCTs consisting of about 600 synthetic drugs. Herbal medicines have been studied in 23 trials (10.6%) among the published RCTs and in 357 registered RCTs (12.7%). Hydroxychloroquine 23 (10.6%) and convalescent plasma 194 (6.9%) alone or in combination with other agents were the most frequently used interventions in published and registered RCTs, respectively. Most published RCTs have been conducted in Western Pacific Region (WPRO) (50 trials, 23.0%) including 45 trials from China. Also, a greater proportion of registered RCTs have been conducted in the Region of the Americas (PAHO) (885 trials, 31.6%) including 596 RCTs from the United States (U.S).

However, the relevance of this parameter in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) remains controversial, given the inconsistencies in its ability to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) and oncological outcomes. Hence, further assessment of the utility of surgical margins for prostate cancer prognosis is required to predict these outcomes more accurately. Over the last decade, studies have used the Gleason score (GS) of positive margins to predict outcomes. Herein, the authors aim to conduct a systematic review investigating the role of GS of PSM after radical prostatectomy in predicting BCR and oncological outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and COCHRANE databases. The review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We will screen titles and abstracts to select articles appropriate for full-text review. Studies discussing GS of PSM after RP will be included. Given the change in reporting of GS, only articles from 2005 to 2019 will be included. The quality of the studies chosen will be assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa tool for non-randomised and Cochrane risk of bias for randomised control studies. We will adopt the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation framework to comment on quality of cumulative evidence. The primary outcome measure will be time to BCR. Secondary outcome measures include secondary treatment, disease-specific survival, disease progression-free and overall mortality at follow-up period.

Materials and Methods: The study analyzed the data reported daily by the Libyan national center of disease control. Results: The total number of tests performed per thousand people was 121.08 test/1000 people, which is a modest rate compared with countries categorized in the same income group. The overall positivity rate of all performed tests over 1 year was 18.1%. During most of the weeks, the positivity rate was far higher than the 5% rate indicating that the epidemic was out of control most of the year. The level of community transmission was moderate to substantial during most of the year, reflecting the weakness in applying the public health control measures. The calculated 1-year instant case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in Libya was 1.89%, comparable to that in other upper-middle-income countries. Conclusions: The number of performed tests in Libya during the 1st year of the COVID-19 epidemic is inadequate and must be at least doubled to increase the chances of diagnosing more potential cases. Based on the current positivity rate, the epidemic appears to be out of control since July 2021.

The results indicate that, for those teachers, teaching Western science to students from traditional communities is important for the expansion of their knowledge and their active participation in different sociocultural environments, through methods that include intercultural dialogue. However, their answers have contradictions, which allow us to infer that their conceptions transit into the four epistemic positions on science teaching and cultural diversity: Epistemological Pluralism, Interculturalism, Multiculturalism, and Universalism, with the first two being the most emphasized. This reveals a dilemma between what they conceive as goals and links for science education, and what they practice as teachers, which is possibly influenced by school pedagogy provided by public policies of national education.

Aptamers can specifically bind to the targets ranging from small molecules to complex structures, making them suitable for a myriad of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In analytical scenarios, aptamers are used as molecular probes instead of antibodies. They have the potential in the detection of biomarkers, microorganisms, viral agents, environmental pollutants, or pathogens. For therapeutic purposes, aptamers can be further engineered with chemical stabilization and modification techniques, thus expanding their serum half-life and shelf life.

Many elective and non-essential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. METHODS: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. RESULTS: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequent and more severe in comorbid elderly patients, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular diseases. There are concerns regarding the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. Some physicians have considered the need for interrupting RAAS inhibition in order to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV2 entering lung cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We offer a different point of view in relation to the need for continuing to use RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. We focused our article on elderly patients because of the distinctive imbalance between the immune response, which is depressed, and the exacerbated inflammatory response, 'inflammaging', which makes the geriatric patient an appropriate candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response. Indeed, COVID-19 is an inflammatory storm that starts and worsens during the course of the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various therapeutic approaches have been tested, including antiviral drugs, interferon, anti-interleukins, hydroxychloroquine, anti-inflammatories, immunoglobulins from recovered patients, and heparins. Some of these therapeutic approaches did not prove to be beneficial, or even induced serious complications. Based on current evidence, in the early stages of the disease modulation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of neprilysin and modulation of the RAAS could affect the course and outcome of COVID-19.","output":"The Cross-Talk between Age, Hypertension and Inflammation in COVID-19 Patients: Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simple and reliable method of ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (UPLC-PDA) was developed to control the quality of Radix Isatidis (dried root of Isatis indigotica) for chemical fingerprint analysis and quantitative analysis of eight bioactive constituents, including R,S-goitrin, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, gluconapin, adenosine, uridine, guanosine, and hypoxanthine.

In growth curve experiments, infectious virus was produced intracellularly starting at 6 hours after inoculation and was followed by rapid release of the virus from the infected cells. The virus contains ribonucleic acid, is ether sensitive and has a size between 100 and 220 nm. At 37 C, the infectivity titer decreased about 2 log(10)TCID(50) per 24 hours.

A simplified, single-day regimen of two injections at separate gluteal and/or deltoid injection sites, together with a single 20-mg dose of oral aripiprazole on the 1st day, was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previously developed population-pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for characterizing aripiprazole PK following oral administration and gluteal intramuscular depot injection was expanded to include deltoid injection. Simulations were conducted to assess PK profiles following various (including two-injection) start regimens. Postmarketing data on patients who received higher-than-recommended AOM doses were used to assess overall safety/tolerability. RESULTS: The two-injection start regimen with a single concurrent oral dose displayed a comparable PK profile to the single-injection start regimen with concurrent 14-day oral administration in simulations. The safety assessment indicated the two-injection start regimen was unlikely to be associated with safety concerns beyond those expected with a single-injection start regimen.

However, these plants face low temperature stress from September to November, which is the period of early sowing, affecting plant development during the initial stages of growth, and reducing rice productivity. This study aimed to characterize the root response to low temperature stress during the early vegetative stage of two rice genotypes contrasting in their cold tolerance (CT, cold-tolerant; and CS, cold-sensitive). Root dry weight and length, as well as the number of root hairs, were higher in CT than CS when exposed to cold treatment. Histochemical analyses indicated that roots of CS genotype present higher levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 accumulation, along with lower levels of plasma membrane integrity than CT under low temperature stress. RNAseq analyses revealed that the contrasting genotypes present completely different molecular responses to cold stress. The number of over-represented functional categories was lower in CT than CS under cold condition, suggesting that CS genotype is more impacted by low temperature stress than CT. Several genes might contribute to rice cold tolerance, including the ones related with cell wall remodeling, cytoskeleton and growth, signaling, antioxidant system, lipid metabolism, and stress response. On the other hand, high expression of the genes SRC2 (defense), root architecture associated 1 (growth), ACC oxidase, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, and cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase 2 (hormone-related) seems to be related with cold sensibility.

Given the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China, we sought to study the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HBV coinfection in patients. METHODS Blood samples of 50 SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients, 56 SARS-CoV-2 mono-infected patients, 57 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patient controls and 57 healthy controls admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected in this study. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry panels including markers indicative of liver functions were performed. Cytokines including IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 were evaluated. T cell, B cell and NK cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection did not significantly affect the outcome of the COVID-19. However, at the onset of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfected patients showed more severe monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as more disturbed hepatic function in albumin production and lipid metabolism. Most of the disarrangement could be reversed after recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS While chronic HBV infection did not predispose COVID-19 patients to more severe outcomes, our data suggests SARS-CoV-2 and HBV coinfection poses a higher extent of dysregulation of host functions at the onset of COVID-19.

Like many viruses, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to circumvent innate immune detection, including low cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) levels in the genome, glycosylation to shield essential elements including the receptor-binding domain, RNA shielding and generation of viral proteins that actively impede anti-viral interferon responses. Together these strategies allow widespread infection and increased viral load. Despite the efforts of immune subversion, SARS-CoV-2 infection activates innate immune pathways inducing a robust type I/III interferon response, production of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells. This may induce hyperinflammation or, alternatively, effectively recruit adaptive immune responses that help clear the infection and prevent reinfection. The dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system due to down-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, together with the activation of type I/III interferon response, and inflammasome response converge to promote free radical production and oxidative stress. This exacerbates tissue damage in the respiratory system, but also leads to widespread activation of coagulation pathways leading to thrombosis. Here, we review the current knowledge of the role of the innate immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection, much of which is based on the knowledge from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.

It is desirable to design and evaluate interpretable feature extraction techniques to describe the patient's condition. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 170 confirmed patients with COVID-19 or bacterial pneumonia acquired at Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, Korea. The Lung and lesion regions were segmented to crop the lesion into 2D patches to train a classifier model that could differentiate between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The K-means algorithm was used to cluster deep features extracted by the trained model into 20 groups. Each lesion patch cluster was described by a characteristic imaging term for comparison. For each CT image containing multiple lesions, a histogram of lesion types was constructed using the cluster information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with the histogram and radiomics features to distinguish diseases and severity. RESULTS: The 20 clusters constructed from 170 patients were reviewed based on common radiographic appearance types. Two clusters showed typical findings of COVID-19, with two other clusters showing typical findings related to bacterial pneumonia. Notably, there is one cluster that showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the central and peripheral lungs and was considered to be a key factor for severity classification. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.2% for classifying COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia patients with 95% reported for severity classification. The CT quantitative parameters represented by the values of cluster 8 were correlated with existing laboratory data and clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Deep chest CT analysis with constructed lesion clusters revealed well-known COVID-19 CT manifestations comparable to manual CT analysis. The constructed histogram features improved accuracy for both diseases and severity classification, and showed correlations with laboratory data and clinical parameters. The constructed histogram features can provide guidance for improved analysis and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Quantitative Assessment of Chest CT Patterns in COVID-19 and Bacterial Pneumonia Patients: a Deep Learning Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are several reasons for obtaining gyroscopic surveys in directional wells. A gyro measurement provides reliable data when magnetic measurements are affected by interference from nearby wells;it can significantly reduce the positional uncertainty and provides redundancy data and gross error checks on MWD surveys. However, the complexity and extent of the necessary testing and handling of the tools have prevented widespread adoption, and gyro services have remained limited to \\"must-have\\" scenarios. The benefits of solid-state technology and new developments in communication capabilities are gradually changing the way of thinking related to wellbore positioning. The first gyro while drilling tools were introduced in the early 2000s and were based on spinning mass gyro technology. These gyros can be very accurate with low noise levels and drift;however, they are fragile, built with moving parts, and susceptible to calibration shifts. Extensive pre-job testing, validation during job execution and post-job analysis are required to obtain reliable directional survey data. Solid-state gyros have reached the same, or even better, levels of noise and drift without the fragility of their spinning mass counterpart. With different degrees of complexity and coverage, remote operations have been used for many years in the oilfield. Still, the adoption of monitoring gyro services with no personnel at the rig-site has been minimal due to the described complexity of the system and the small volume of jobs that prevented investment and the development of the necessary processes. Solid-state gyro technology addresses these challenges More than 30 gyro-while-drilling jobs have successfully run remotely. The changes in operational procedures forced by the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the demand for uncrewed operations, and solid-state gyro technology has shown high reliability with zero non-productive time due to tool failures or shifts in the calibration. This new way of working also results in a significant reduction in the environmental impact of the operations as all travel related to personnel and equipment has been reduced and battery life extended by up to 10. Several scenarios related to wellbore positioning and directional drilling greatly benefit by having a gyro in the BHA. The gyro technology and the workflow described in this paper show how this can be done reliably, maintaining the quality of the survey data and reducing the environmental impact. ? 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers","output":"Solid-state gyro technology allows safe and reliable real-time remote operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The zoonotic disease called COVID-19 has been the worlds number one enemy for nearly a year now.

However, the characteristics of repositive results are still not well understood, leading to a lack of effective monitoring strategies. METHODS: In the present study, a total of 59 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and the characteristics of the repositive samples were analyzed. RESULTS: The repositive rate in this cohort was 15.79%. The N gene was the main target gene that was positive in the repositive results as well as in the last positive results of all patients. The median duration from diagnosis to the last positive test was 20 days (IQR, 16-31 days), and the longest duration was 40 days. Repositivity was only observed in IgM single- or both IgM- and IgG-positive patients, instead of IgG single-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant proportion of repositives in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and increasing the required number of negatives for consecutive nucleic acid tests may reduce the incidence of repositives. The recommended monitoring strategy for repositivity is monitoring the N gene in IgM-positive patients.

Human decidual cells may act as reservoirs for trimester-dependent placental transmission of ZIKV, accounting for the higher Zika infection susceptibility and more severe fetal sequelae observed in early versus late pregnancy.

Neonates of women not in labor delivered via C-section are at increased risk of respiratory distress; it is unclear whether vigorous neonates without a need of resuscitation would benefit from prone positioning immediately after birth. Objective: To determine whether prone positioning of vigorous term neonates for the first 5 minutes after scheduled cesarean delivery will decrease the incidence of respiratory distress and therapeutic interventions, characterized by the frequency and duration of respiratory support (RS). Design/methods: In a single center, randomized parallel clinical trial, vigorous term neonates delivered via scheduled cesarean delivery were positioned prone or supine and their heart rate, oxygen saturation and signs of respiratory distress were recorded at 1-minute intervals for the first 5 minutes. Infants not reaching target oxygen saturations suggested by the neonatal resuscitation guidelines received RS via Neopuff in supine position; respiratory support was discontinued once oxygen saturation targets were met and infant was free of respiratory symptoms. Primary outcomes measured were frequency and duration of RS, secondary outcomes were admission to the NICU for respiratory distress, length of stay, heart rate and oxygen saturation during the initial 5 minutes of life. Results: Two hundred twenty-five neonates in prone and 231 in supine position completed the study out of 500 randomized subjects.

Virus evolution is very similar, but not identical, to host evolution. Darwinian principles apply, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution, distinguish virus evolution. In RNA viruses, high error rates have led to the quasispecies concept in which collective populations are the basis of evolution. These populations provide viruses with high capacities for adaptation. Yet some RNA viruses show remarkable evolutionary stability. With DNA viruses, especially of bacteria, extensive recombination defines vast dynamic and ancient genetic pools. Temperate viruses can directly affect host gene pools by stable colonization.

This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty(s) (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty(r) (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps(d) nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection.

Outcomes include infections, $/infection-prevented, and $/quality-adjusted-life-year ($/QALY). Strategies included extensive social distancing (ESD), masks, and routine laboratory tests (RLT). We report results per 5,000 students (1,000 faculty) over one semester (105 days). Results: Mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases among students (faculty) from 3,746 (164) with no mitigation to 493 (28) with ESD and masks, and further to 151 (25) adding RLTq3 among asymptomatic students and faculty.

We aim to present our results of video-endoscopic tension-free repair of groin hernias via the total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. Methods Between September 2016 and December 2018, 124 patients with groin hernias underwent tension-free repair using prolene mesh by video-endoscopic surgery via the TEP approach. This is a retrospective analysis of 110 (88.7%) male and 14 (11.3%) female patients with a mean age of 48.1 years. Groin hernia types, locations of hernias, intraoperative and postoperative complications, results of the mean 24-month follow-up, and recurrence rate were reported. Results A total of 134 hernias were repaired in 124 patients who had 53 (42.7%) right, 61 (49.2%) left, and 10 (8.1%) bilateral groin hernias. The most common hernia type was an indirect inguinal hernia in 83/134 (62%) groin hernias. A total of 119 (88.8%) and 15 (11.2%) hernias were primary and recurrent, respectively. Seroma was detected in two (1.6%) patients in the early postoperative period. The mean duration of hospital stay was 1.4 (1-3) days.

The results of hernia repair via the TEP approach are highly satisfactory and encouraging, especially when attention is paid to proper patient selection during the learning curve period.","output":"Video-endoscopic Tension-free Groin Hernia Repair via Total Extraperitoneal Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Family/caregiver visitation provides critical support for patients confronting cancer and is associated with positive outcomes. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought historic disruptions including widespread visitation restrictions. Here, we characterize in-depth the visitor policies of NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) and analyze geographic/temporal patterns across CCCs. METHODS: The public-facing CCC websites, including archived webpages, were reviewed to abstract initial visitation policies and revisions, including end-of-life (EoL) exceptions and timing of visitation restrictions relative to regional lockdowns. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were employed to analyze associations between geographic region, timing, and severity of restrictions. RESULTS: Most CCCs (n=43, 86%) enacted visitation restrictions between March 15 and April 15, 2020. About half barred all visitors for COVID-negative inpatients (n=24, 48%) or outpatients (n=26, 52%). Most (n=36, 72%) prohibited visitors for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Most (n=40, 80%) published EoL exceptions but the specifics were highly variable. The median time from initial restrictions to government-mandated lockdowns was 1 day, with a wide range (25 days before to 26 days after). There was no association between timing of initial restrictions and geographic location (p=0.14) or severity of inpatient policies (p=1.0), even among centers in the same city. Outpatient policies published reactively (after lockdown) were more restrictive than those published proactively (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: CCCs enacted strict but strikingly variable COVID-19 visitation restrictions, with important implications for patients/families seeking cancer care. A unified, evidence-based approach to visitation policies is needed to balance proven infection control measures with the needs of patients and families.","output":"Visitation policies at NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last year of Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized by the continuous chase between the vaccination campaign and the appearance of new variants that put further obstacles to the possibility of eradicating the virus and returning to normality in a short period. In the present paper we consider a deterministic compartmental model to discuss the evolution of the Covid-19 in Italy as a combined effect of vaccination campaign, new variant spreading, waning immunity and mobility restrictions. We analyze the role that different mechanisms, such as behavioral changes due to variable risk perception, variation of the population mobility, seasonal variability of the virus infectivity, and spreading of new variants have had in shaping the epidemiological curve. The fundamental impact of vaccines in drastically reducing the total increase in infections and deaths is also estimated. This work further underlines the crucial importance of vaccination and adoption of adequate individual protective measures in containing the pandemic.","output":"Vaccination and Variants: retrospective model for the evolution of Covid-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: For older adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated UK restrictions arrived during a critical period in the transition to adulthood.

Although telemedicine is not a novel technology, previous studies have offered mixed opinions surrounding its utilization. However, there exists a dearth of research on how these opinions have evolved over the course of the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate how the language and sentiment surrounding telemedicine has evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets published between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2021, containing at least one telemedicine-related and one COVID-19Crelated search term (telemedicine-COVID) were collected from the Twitter full archive search (N=351,718). A comparator sample containing only COVID-19 terms (general-COVID) was collected and sampled based on the daily distribution of telemedicine-COVID tweets. In addition to analyses of retweets and favorites, sentiment analysis was performed on both data sets in aggregate and within a subset of tweets receiving the top 100 most and least retweets. RESULTS: Telemedicine gained prominence during the early stages of the pandemic (ie, March through May 2020) before leveling off and reaching a steady state from June 2020 onward. Telemedicine-COVID tweets had a 21% lower average number of retweets than general-COVID tweets (incidence rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=.04), but there was no difference in favorites. A majority of telemedicine-COVID tweets (180,295/351,718, 51.3%) were characterized as positive, compared to only 38.5% (135,434/351,401) of general-COVID tweets (P<.001). This trend was also true on a monthly level from March 2020 through April 2021. The most retweeted posts in both telemedicine-COVID and general-COVID data sets were authored by journalists and politicians. Whereas the majority of the most retweeted posts within the telemedicine-COVID data set were positive (55/101, 54.5%), a plurality of the most retweeted posts within the general-COVID data set were negative (44/89, 49.4%; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, opinions surrounding telemedicine evolved to become more positive, especially when compared to the larger pool of COVID-19Crelated tweets. Decision makers should capitalize on these shifting public opinions to invest in telemedicine infrastructure and ensure its accessibility and success in a postpandemic world.","output":"Language and Sentiment Regarding Telemedicine and COVID-19 on Twitter: Longitudinal Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To objectively assess the quality of \\"crisis communication\\" media, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the three Greater Maghreb countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco). METHODS: A compliance audit for press releases and epidemiological bulletins was analyzed against a quality benchmark, which had been specifically designed by the authors. This framework, made up of five dimensions and 50 items, graded (0/1), was applied by two researchers in preventive medicine. Multiplying the scores by a coefficient of two resulted in a partial score of 20 points for each dimension and a total score of 100 points for the checklist taken as a whole. The quality of the communication media was considered to be good when exceeding the thresholds of 15/20 for the different dimensions and 75/100 for the entire grid. RESULTS: A total of 141 information media were included in this audit (Tunisia: 60; Algeria: 60; Morocco: 21). The overall median quality score for these media was only 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), without major variability between countries. The most appreciated dimension was \\"maintaining the confidence of the population\\", with an overall median score of 14/20 (12/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 16/20 for press releases). The most poorly rated dimension was \\"strengthening community participation\\", with a median score of only 4/20 (6/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 4/20 for press releases). CONCLUSION: The quality of the Maghreb crisis communication media during COVID-19 was insufficient in most of its dimensions and items, particularly from a psychosocial standpoint. Reinforcement of the capacities of communication officers to develop information material and supports during health crises is indispensable and should be considered as an urgent matter.","output":"[Quality of \\"crisis communication\\" media during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Great Maghreb countries]./ Qualit des supports de communication de crise lors de la pandmie de la COVID-19 au Grand Maghreb"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a social network weight loss intervention delivered by lay health promoters (HPs) to immigrant populations. DESIGN: Single-arm, non-randomized, pilot study of a social network weight loss intervention developed by a community-based participatory research partnership and delivered by HPs. SETTING: Community-based setting in Southeastern Minnesota, United States. SAMPLE: Somali and Hispanic immigrants to the United States: 4 social networks of adults (2 Hispanic and 2 Somali) with 39 network participants. INTERVENTION: Twelve-week behavioral weight loss intervention delivered by HPs (4 weeks in-person and then 8 weeks virtual). MEASURES: Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and retention rates. Acceptability was assessed by surveys and focus groups with HPs and participants. Behavioral measures included servings of fruits and vegetables, drinking soda, and physical activity. Physiologic measures included weight, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. ANALYSIS: Paired t-tests of pre- to post-intervention changes at the end of 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Recruitment was feasible and post-intervention was 100%. Participants highly rated the intervention on satisfaction, motivation, and confidence to eat a healthy diet, be physically active, and lose weight. Participants were motivated by group social support and cohesion of their social networks. On average, participants lost weight (91.6  15.9 to 89.7  16.6 kg, P < .0001), lowered their systolic blood pressure (133.916.9 to 127.2  15.8 mm Hg; P < .001), lowered their diastolic blood pressure (81  9.5 to 75.8  9.6 mm Hg; P < .0001), had more servings of vegetables per day (1.9  1.2 to 2.6  1.4; P < .001), and increased their physical activity (2690  3231 to 6595  7322 MET-minutes per week; P = .02).

Furthermore, different neurotropic viruses will affect the CNS at distinct developmental stages, from early prenatal brain development to the aged brain. With the unique flexibility and scalability of human pluripotent stem cell technology, it is now possible to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying acute infection and latency, determine which CNS subpopulations are specifically infected, study temporal aspects of viral susceptibility, perform high-throughput chemical or genetic screens for viral restriction factors and explore complex cell-non-autonomous disease mechanisms.

The occurrence of anemia is also an additional burden to the micro vascular complications of patients with diabetes. In the selected study structure no published data were found on the prevalence of anemia and associated factors in diabetic patients. Hence, the findings of this study are very fruitful as an input for further studies and after the repetition of similar studies in different frameworks. It is helpful as input for the development of guidelines at diabetes clinics to request the laboratory assessment of hemoglobin as a routine activity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among diabetic patients who attended Bale zone hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from September 2020Cto January 2021 GC among adult diabetic patients who had follow-up at Bale zone hospitals. A total of 238 study participants were determined by single population proportion sample size calculation formula taking prevalence of anemia among adult diabetic patients 19.0%. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Information on demographic and associated factors of anemia in diabetic patients was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Blood sample collection was performed under aseptic conditions by a licensed medical laboratory professional. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1, cleaned and exported to statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 25 software tools. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with anemia in diabetic patients. P-value less than 0.05 and 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. The odds ratios were reported to indicate the strength of associations. Frequencies, percentages, charts and tables were used to summarize the characteristics of study participants. RESULTS: In this study anemia among adult diabetic patients is 18.1% (95% CI (13.2, 23.0%).

However, the most common methods to assess aroma are based on expensive equipment or human senses through sensory evaluation, which is time-consuming and requires highly trained assessors to avoid subjectivity. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the coffee intensity and aromas using a low-cost and portable electronic nose (e-nose) and machine learning modeling. For this purpose, triplicates of nine commercial coffee samples with different intensity levels were used for this study. Two machine learning models were developed based on artificial neural networks using the data from the e-nose as inputs to (i) classify the samples into low, medium, and high-intensity (Model 1) and (ii) to predict the relative abundance of 45 different aromas (Model 2). Results showed that it is possible to estimate the intensity of coffees with high accuracy (98%; Model 1), as well as to predict the specific aromas obtaining a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99), and no under- or over-fitting of the models were detected.

We aimed to study the association between levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and adverse clinical outcomes linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further aimed to observe the incidence of low, below-average, and normal levels of 25(OH)D in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and May 20, 2020, and assess whether these values differed between these patients and a normal population. Finally, we determined whether the need for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality rate were related to low levels of 25(OH)D. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study SETTING: Quironsalud Hospitals in Madrid, Spain PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 1549 patients (mean age, 70 years; range, 21-104 years); 835 were male (53.9%; mean age, 73.02 years), and 714 were female (46.1%; mean age, 68.05 years). Subsequently, infected patients admitted to the ICU (n = 112) and those with a fatal outcome (n = 324) were analyzed. PROCEDURES: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured by electrochemiluminescence. RESULTS: More hospitalized patients (66%, n = 1017) had low baseline levels of 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) than normal individuals (45%) (p < 0.001). An analysis by age group revealed that COVID-19 patients between the ages of 20 and 80 years old had significantly lower vitamin D levels than those of the normal population (p < 0.001). Patients admitted to the ICU tended to have lower levels of 25(OH)D than other inpatients (p < 0.001); if we stratified patients by 25(OH)D levels, we observed that the rate of ICU admission was higher among patients with vitamin D deficiency (p < 0.001), indicating that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of ICU admission due to COVID-19. ICU admission was related to sex (higher rates in men, p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001). When using a logistic regression model, we found that vitamin D levels continued to show a statistically significant relationship with ICU admission rates, even when adjusting for sex and age.

On such a platform, the independent microvolume reactions on individual minipillars greatly decrease the consumption of reagents. The microstreaming driven by ultrasound creates on-demand contactless microagitation in the microdroplets and promotes the interaction between RPA components, thus greatly accelerating the amplification. In the presence of microstreaming, the detection time is 6-12 min, which is 38.8-59.3% shorter than that of controls without microstreaming, and the end-point fluorescence intensity also increased 1.3-1.7 times. Furthermore, the microagitation-enhanced RPA also exhibits a lower detection limit (0.42 copy/L) for SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to the controls. This integrated microdroplet array detection platform is expected to meet the needs for high-throughput nucleic acid testing (NAT) to improve the containment of viral transmission during the epidemic, as well as provide a potential platform for the timely detection of other pathogens or viruses.","output":"Enhanced Isothermal Amplification for Ultrafast Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in Microdroplets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Causes of cough: Acute cough (<3 weeks): Respiratory tract infections: viral upper respiratory tract infection, viral rhinosinusitis, common cold, acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of COPD; pertussis.

One key strategy to do this is to address key governance deficiencies. This includes: siloed preparedness and response efforts were. Responses were largely isolated from regular public health and health system structures. In many countries we have seen that crisis responses have not made use of existing public health infrastructure including sickness-funds, public health offices, social partnerships and professional associations, let alone the existing governance structures for patient participation. a lack in health leadership. During the pandemic health has been high on the political agenda as never before, but instead of having a Health in All Policies response, we had an All-Policies-in-Health-response. Prime ministers, regional heads of states and ministers in charge of the economy, interior and education have been usually much more central and influential in formulating a pandemic response than the minister of health and other health leaders. BACKGROUND: Europe's countries should have responded better to the pandemic given its vast resources. It has highly developed public health services and high performing health systems embedded in comprehensive welfare systems and thriving economies. Explaining Europe's surprisingly disappointing response to the pandemic needs to go beyond arguments based solely on geography, political system, demography or wealth of the nation. These arguments can neither explain the variations within Europe nor the ones between the world regions. Therefore panelists will discuss the following topics in the light of the above mentioned governance deficiencies: From failure to resilience: the contribution of governance. Drawing lessons on better governing emergencies: systems Integration and health leadership. Governing COVID-19 within countries at all levels - national, regional and local. Governing the private sector in pandemic times: towards new public-private-partnerships. Governing health professionals surge capacity. ADDED VALUE: This round table brings together governance deficiencies and how to remedy them and eventually strengthen health and health systems resilience. This is key if we want to better address the challenges to come. Coherence presentations/workshop topic: All presenters will need to lin their talks and topics to the two governance deficiencies identified. INTERACTIVITY: After the chair persons have introduced the topic the panel discussion will go in three rounds addressing different aspects: a) core message (related to the topic); b) the problem of siloed preparedness and response effort c) Insufficient health leadership. In between these rounds the chairs will pick up questions coming through the chat-box and feed them to the panelists. SPEAKERS/PANELISTS: Anna Sagan.

This justification is built as an explication and critical analysis of the program of philosophical research in science and technology, the main content and results of which are presented in the monograph by I.T. Kasavin Science As a Humanistic Project (2020). This article describes how the search for new strategies for the study of science is carried out within the framework of Russian philosophy. The historicity of science is analyzed, and the complex topology of its genesis is shown, which does not fit into the linear scheme of historical continuity, reflecting the synchronous coexistence of different variations of science as a cultural phenomenon. The historicity of science makes us turn to the question of its cultural and historical agency; it is substantiated that this agency acquires a political character in the current activity. How can the political agency of science be perceived and consistently combined with the ethos of the expert community? According to the author, political agency and the range of interests that scientists defend in public are determined by understanding the essence of science as a cultural phenomenon. The existential and cultural-creative functions of science are emphasized; on this basis the authors interpretation of the humanistic project suggested by Kasavin is proposed as a program for the humanization of technoscience.","output":"Sociohumanistic Knowledge and the Future of Science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism highlighted health inequities that have existed for decades among Black communities.

As the IL-22/IL-22R1 axis was reported to be involved in inflammation during viral infections, we characterized the expression of IL-22 receptor1, IL-22 and IL-22 binding protein in COVID-19 patients. Blood samples were collected from 19 non-severe and 14 severe patients on the day they presented (D0), at D14, and six months later, and from 6 non-infected controls. The IL-22R1 expression was characterized by flow cytometry. Results were related to HLA-DR expression of myeloid cells, to plasma concentrations of different cytokines and chemokines and NK cells and T lymphocytes functions characterized by their IFN-, IL-22, IL-17A, granzyme B and perforin content. The numbers of IL-22R1+ classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes and the proportions of IL-22R1+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC), myeloid DC1 and DC2 (mDC1, mDC2) were higher in patients than controls at D0. The proportions of IL-22R1+ classical and intermediate monocytes, and pDC and mDC2 remained high for six months. High proportions of IL-22R1+ non-classical monocytes and mDC2 displayed HLA-DRhigh expression and were thus activated. Multivariate analysis for all IL-22R1+ myeloid cells discriminated the severity of the disease (AUC=0.9023). However, correlation analysis between IL-22R1+ cell subsets and plasma chemokine concentrations suggested pro-inflammatory effects of some subsets and protective effects of others. The numbers of IL-22R1+ classical monocytes and pDC were positively correlated with pro-inflammatory chemokines MCP-1 and IP-10 in severe infections, whereas IL-22R1+ intermediate monocytes were negatively correlated with IL-6, IFN- and CRP in non-severe infections. Moreover, in the absence of in vitro stimulation, NK and CD4+ T cells produced IFN- and IL-22, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produced IL-17A. CD4+ T lymphocytes also expressed IL-22R1, the density of its expression defining two different functional subsets. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by an abnormal expression of IL22R1 on blood myeloid cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Our results suggest that the involvement of the IL-22R1/IL-22 axis could be protective at the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection but could shift to a detrimental response over time.","output":"Distinct Expression Patterns of Interleukin-22 Receptor 1 on Blood Hematopoietic Cells in SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

This year in view of COVID-19 pandemic, attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination are particularly important. A cross-sectional study was completed to understand how to best encourage and facilitate the vaccination of HCWs based on the previous years' findings. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS: The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360). A total of 82% of participants (N = 590) agreed that healthcare workers should be vaccinated, with 56% (N = 405) agreeing that it should be mandatory. Of the participants who were not vaccinated last year (N = 159), 40% (N = 63) agreed that COVID-19 had changed their opinion on influenza immunisation with a further 11% (N = 18) strongly agreeing.

METHODS: We developed a sequential assessment of the risk reduction provided by face coverings using a step-by-step approach. The UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) Population Survey data were utilised to determine the baseline total number of community-derived infections. These were linked to reported hospital admissions/hospital deaths to create case admission risk ratio and admission-related fatality rate. We evaluated published evidence to establish an infection risk reduction for face coverings. We calculated an Infection Risk Score (IRS) for a number of common activities and related it to the effectiveness of reducing infection and its consequences, with a face covering, and evaluated their effect when applied to different infection rates over 3 months from July 24, 2020, when face coverings were made compulsory in England on public transport/retail outlets. RESULTS: We show that only 7.3% of all community-based infection risk is associated with public transport/retail outlets. In the week of July 24, The reported weekly community infection rate was 29 400 new cases at the start (July 24). The rate of growth in hospital admissions and deaths for England was around -15%/week, suggesting the infection rate, R, in the most vulnerable populations was just above 0.8. In this situation, average infections over the evaluated 13 week follow-up period, would be 9517/week with face covering of 40% effectiveness, thus, reducing average infections by 844/week, hospital admissions by 8/week and deaths by 0.6/week; a fall of 9% over the period total. If, however, the R-value rises to 1.0, then, average community infections would stay at 29 400/week and mandatory face coverings could reduce average weekly infections by 3930, hospital admissions by 36 and deaths by 2.9/week; a 13% reduction. If the R-value rose and stayed at 1.2, then, expected average community-derived hospital admissions would be 975/week and 40% effective face coverings would reduce this by 167/week and reduce possible expected hospital deaths from 80/week to 66/week. These reductions should be seen in the context that there was an average of 102 000/week all-cause hospital emergency admissions in England in June and 8900 total reported deaths in the week ending August 7, 2020. CONCLUSION: We have illustrated that the policy on mandatory use of face coverings in retail outlets/on public transport may have been very well followed, but may be of limited value in reducing hospital admissions and deaths, at least at the time that it was introduced, unless infections begin to rise faster than currently seen. The impact appears small compared with all other sources of risk, thereby raising questions regarding the effectiveness of the policy.","output":"Modelling the impact of the mandatory use of face coverings on public transport and in retail outlets in the UK on COVID-19-related infections, hospital admissions and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indonesia still faces a challenge in achieving an appropriate complementary feeding (CF) practice for the child aged 6 to 24 months.

METHODS: Three N95 masks of different makes (A, B and C) were subjected to six decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) dip, plasma sterilization (Sterrad?), ethylene oxide (ETO, 3M?), dry heat sterilization, and moist heat sterilization (autoclaving). The integrity of the N95 masks was assessed by measuring their particle filtering efficiency at particle sizes ranging 0.3-0.5 microns. RESULTS: All the masks decontaminated with ETO and plasma sterilization retained over 95% particle filtering efficiency. Masks decontaminated using IPA dip and autoclaving showed a drop, and UV irradiation showed variations in particle size efficiency degradation after decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma sterilization is recommended for decontamination of N95 masks in low-resource settings. ETO is not recommended due to hazards associated with handling of ethylene oxide, although the filtering efficiency was retained. Since the UV irradiation method showed variations in results, evaluation of UV decontamination for N95 masks needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis.","output":"Reprocessing of N95 masks: Experience from a resource-limited setting in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myopic anisometropic amblyopia in pediatrics is one of the most challenging clinical situations that can face an ophthalmologist. Conventional correction modalities for myopic anisometropia, using spectacles, contact lenses, and/or occlusion therapy, may not be suitable for some pediatric patients or for some ocular conditions. This may lead to the development of anisometropic amblyopia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the visual and the refractive efficacy, safety, and stability of Posterior Chamber Phakic Intraocular Lenses (PC-pIOLs) for correcting myopic anisometropic amblyopia in a pediatric cohort. METHODS: This case series, prospective, interventional study was conducted at Watany Eye Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. It comprised children and teenagers with myopic anisometropic amblyopia and unsuccessful conventional therapy. After implantation of Intraocular Collamer Lenses ICLs (Visian ICL, Model V4c, STAAR Surgical, Monrovia, California, USA), postoperative follow-up visits were scheduled, with automated refraction and Pentacam imaging performed. RESULTS: The study enrolled 42 eyes of 42 patients. The age range was 3 to 18 years (mean  SD = 10.74 years 4.16). The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was ? 12.85 D  2.74. The results declared a significant improvement in the postoperative Corrected Distance Visual Acuity CDVA (P value < 0.01) and SE (P value < 0.01). The efficacy index had a value of 1.18  0.3 and the safety index was 1.09  0.24. The follow-up visits had a mean  SD of 14.67 months 16.56 (range of 1 to 54 months).

No postoperative complications were encountered. Worthy of mention is that there was a significant (80%) non-compliance with the prescribed postoperative occlusion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study, with the longest reported follow-up range, declared the long-term efficacy, safety, and stability of Visian ICLs for correcting myopic anisometropic amblyopia in pediatrics. The reported non-compliance with occlusion therapy validates the early implantation of Visian ICLs in cases with failed conventional therapy to guard against anisometropic amblyopia.","output":"Evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and stability of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses for correcting intractable myopic anisometropic amblyopia in a pediatric cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Ventilator weaning protocols rely in part on objective indices to best predict extubation failure in the critically ill. In this study, we investigated static lung compliance (LC) as a predictor of extubation failure, in comparison to extubation readiness using rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). METHODS: A cross-sectional, multi-institutional study of 2,334 mechanically ventilated patients admitted from 12/01/2017-12/01/2019. We included all older than 18 years with a documented spontaneous breathing trial and extubation trial. Static lung compliance and RSBI were calculated prior to extubation trial. The primary outcome was extubation failure - defined as need for reintubation within 24 hours from time of extubation. RESULTS: Of the 2,334 patients, 55.6% were males with a mean age of 66-years. The population consisted mostly of Caucasians (74%) and African Americans (20%). 183 of 2,334 (7.84%) patients required reintubation within 24 hours. There was a negative correlation between RSBI and lung compliance at time of extubation trial. The logLC of patients requiring reintubation was significantly lower than those who remained extubated with a mean of 3.58  0.43 vs. 3.69  0.49 (95% CI in difference:0.041 -0.17;p = 0.001). Whereas, log RSBI was not significant for 24-hour reintubation (p = 0.521). Patients were then dichotomized to a compliance of less or greater than 50 and RSBI of less or greater than 104. LC < 50 remained a significant predictor for extubation failure (OR 1.54;95% CI: 1.07-2.22;p = 0.019) whereas, RSBI >104 was not associated with extubation failure (OR 1.53;98% CI:0.20 -11.57;p = 0.674). On multivariate logistic regression after adjusting for age, mode of ventilation, ventilator days, and P/F ratio, LC remained the strongest predictor for 24-hr reintubation (OR 1.56;95% CI: 1.14-2.13). CONCLUSIONS: Static lung compliance measured at the day of extubation is a promising physiological discriminant to evaluate extubation readiness. We recommend further validation studies in prospective cohorts.

However, previous case reports suggest that low-voltage shock impedance measurements may fail to detect insulation breaches that can cause life-threatening electrical short circuits. METHODS AND RESULTS We report six cases of insulation breaches in transvenous defibrillation leads that were not obvious during standard interrogations and testing of the lead beforehand. In two cases, an electrical short circuit during commanded shock delivery for internal electrical cardioversion resulted in a total damage of the ICD generator. In one of these cases, commanded shock delivery induced ventricular fibrillation, which required external defibrillation. In two cases, a shock due to ventricular tachycardia was aborted as the shock impedance was less than 20 Ohm. However, in both cases the tiny residual shock energy terminated the ventricular tachycardia. In contrast, in one case the residual energy of the aborted shock did not end ventricular fibrillation induced at defibrillator threshold testing. In one case, the ICD indicated an error code for a short circuit condition detected during an adequate shock delivery. CONCLUSIONS This case series illustrates that low-voltage shock impedance measurements can fail to detect insulation breaches. These data suggest that in patients without a contraindication, traditional defibrillator threshold testing or high voltage synchronized shock at the time of device replacement should be considered.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (15 years) individuals in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and 55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (prevalence, incidence or mortality). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first review stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using the Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. RESULTS Twenty-two studies (20 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 839,680 participants (364,616 females) in eight countries from three WHO regions (Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (13 studies), self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies), direct diagnosis by a physician (1 study) or during a medical interview (1 study). The outcome was defined as an incident non-fatal stroke event in nine studies (7 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies), incident fatal stroke event in one cohort study and incident non-fatal or fatal (\\"mixed\\") event in 12 studies (all cohort studies). Cohort studies were judged to have a relatively low risk of bias; therefore, we prioritized evidence from these studies, but synthesised evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. stroke incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). Eligible studies were found on the effects of long working hours on stroke incidence and mortality, but not prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were uncertain about the effect on incidence of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.14, 18 studies, 277,202 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence). There may have been an increased risk for acquiring stroke when working 49-54 h/week compared with 35-40 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28, 17 studies, 275,181participants, I2 0%, p 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working 55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring stroke, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61, 7 studies, 162,644 participants, I2 3%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12, 12 studies, 265,937 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence), 49-54 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, 11 studies, 256,129 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 55 h/week (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.31, 10 studies, 664,647 participants, I2 20%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region, age, sex, socioeconomic status and type of stroke. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus \\"mixed\\") except for the comparison working 55 h/week versus 35-40 h/week for stroke incidence (p for subgroup differences: 0.05), risk of bias (\\"high\\"/\\"probably high\\" ratings in any domain versus \\"low\\"/\\"probably low\\" in all domains), effect estimate measures (risk versus hazard versus odds ratios) and comparator (exact versus approximate definition). CONCLUSIONS We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as \\"inadequate evidence for harmfulness\\" for all exposure categories for stroke prevalence and mortality and for exposure to 41-48 h/week for stroke incidence. Evidence on exposure to 48-54 h/week and 55 h/week was judged as \\"limited evidence for harmfulness\\" and \\"sufficient evidence for harmfulness\\" for stroke incidence, respectively. Producing estimates for the burden of stroke attributable to exposures to working 48-54 and 55 h/week appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

To account more comprehensively for such non-monetary costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study investigates whether changes in partners' employment situation during the COVID-19 crisis - particularly home-office and short-time work - had an immediate impact on the relationship satisfaction of cohabiting married and unmarried couples. To do so, we estimated fixed-effects regression models, exploiting unique data from the German Family Panel (pairfam;wave 11) and its supplementary COVID-19 web-survey. We observed a substantial proportion of respondents experiencing positive (20%) or negative (40%) changes in relationship satisfaction during the crisis. Relationship satisfaction has decreased, on average, for men and women alike, almost irrespective of whether they experienced COVID-19-related changes in their employment situation. While partners' employment situation hardly moderated the negative association between respondents' employment and relationship satisfaction, the presence of children seemed to buffer partly against a COVID-19-related decrease. Our results thus confirm previous findings suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a threat to couples' relationship quality and healthy family functioning more generally.","output":"Changes in employment and relationship satisfaction in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the German Family Panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although many studies have explored the neural mechanism of the feeling of stress, to date, no effort has been made to establish a model capable of predicting the feeling of stress at the individual level using the resting-state functional connectome. Although individuals may be confronted with multidimensional stressors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, their appraisal of the impact and severity of these events might vary. In this study, connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) with leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to predict individual perceived stress (PS) from whole-brain functional connectivity data from 817 participants. The results showed that the feeling of stress could be predicted by the interaction between the default model network and salience network, which are involved in emotion regulation and salience attribution, respectively. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model comprised regions mainly located in the limbic systems and temporal lobe. Critically, the CPM model of PS based on regular days can be generalized to predict individual PS levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a multidimensional, uncontrollable stressful situation. The stability of the results was demonstrated by two independent datasets. The present work not only expands existing knowledge regarding the neural mechanism of PS but also may help identify high-risk individuals in healthy populations.","output":"The functional connectome predicts feeling of stress on regular days and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents with widely varying severity of disease, with pediatric patients experiencing milder disease than adults. Most children requiring mechanical ventilation had underlying comorbidities, most commonly cardiovascular abnormality or obesity. We report an adolescent with severe obesity with COVID19 pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, incidentally, found to have a Morgagni hernia. Case: A 15-year-old male, with severe obesity (BMI 67) presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to severe COVID19 pneumonia. Chest X-ray on admission was significant for bilateral reticulonodular opacities consistent with COVID19. His respiratory failure rapidly progressed despite high-flow nasal oxygen, leading to intubation for high pressure mechanical ventilation and adjunct inhaled nitric oxide to improve oxygenation. He was treated with Remdesivir and dexamethasone. He developed pulmonary edema, which was managed with aggressive diuresis and fluid restriction. He developed right axillary and basilic occlusive thrombi associated with hypercoagulability and was treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium. Subsequent chest X-ray showed significant left hemidiaphragm elevation, concerning for diaphragmatic eventration. After 15 days of intubation, he was extubated to continuous non-invasive ventilation (NIV) before weaning to room air when awake and empiric nocturnal NIV with supplemental oxygen due to hypoxemia attributed to previously undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea and atelectasis secondary to his illness and deconditioning. CT Chest demonstrated a massive Morgagni hernia containing mesenteric fat and multiple loops of bowel, with associated left lung compression and displacement of the heart and mediastinum into the right hemithorax. Lung parenchyma had scattered areas of air trapping and small airway obstruction. Gated cardiac CT showed low to normal systolic function without pulmonary hypertension. The patient was discharged with nocturnal NIV with supplemental oxygen with plans for outpatient polysomnography and titration. Surgical correction of the diaphragmatic defect was deferred as patient had no gastrointestinal symptoms and follow up CT Chest at discharge showed no evidence of obstruction or strangulation. Discussion: Limited data exists regarding risk factors for severe COVID19 disease in pediatric patients, but describes chronic cardiac conditions, respiratory disease and obesity as prominent risk factors, similarly described in adult populations. Despite severity of presentation, a high proportion of adolescents recover without sequelae thus far. We present a case of severe COVID19 in an adolescent with multiple comorbidities, incidentally, found to have a Morgagni hernia. This case represents a favorable outcome despite multiple risk factors and severe presentation requiring mechanical ventilation.","output":"More than COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are increasingly recognized as being on a continuum of cytokine storm syndromes, with different initiating pathways culminating in cytotoxic dysfunction and uncontrolled activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages.

Here, a strategy for effectively dispersing graphene using graphene oxide (GO) to produce homogeneous, tunable, and ultrahigh concentration graphene dispersions (>150 mg mL-1 ) is proposed. The structure of GO with abundant edge-bound hydrophilic carboxyl groups and in-plane hydrophobic &#960;-conjugated domains allows it to function as a special \\"surfactant\\" that enables graphene dispersion. In acidic solutions, GO sheets tend to form edge-to-edge hydrogen bonds and expose the &#960;-conjugated regions which interact with graphene, thereby promoting graphene dispersion. While in alkaline solutions, GO sheets tend to stack in a surface-to-surface manner, thereby blocking the &#960;-conjugated regions and impeding graphene dispersion. As the concentration of GO-dispersed graphene dispersion (GO/G) increases, a continuous transition between four states is obtained, including a dilute dispersion, a thick paste, a free-standing gel, and a kneadable, playdough-like material. Furthermore, GO/G can be applied to create desirable structures including highly conductive graphene films with excellent flexibility, thereby demonstrating an immense potential in flexible composite materials.","output":"Graphene Oxide \\"Surfactant\\"-Directed Tunable Concentration of Graphene Dispersion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treat-to-target strategies (disease activity, remission rates) and access to physical consultations in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as to explore characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations in the clinic and the impact of early vs established disease. METHODS: Patients with RA, PsA or axial SpA (axSpA) prospectively followed in the nationwide DANBIO registry answered online questionnaires and reported patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in June and November 2020. Patient characteristics, disease activity and physical consultations in the clinic before and during the pandemic were identified in DANBIO [all patients and subgroups with early disease (disease duration 2 years)]. In individual patients, changes in PROs before and during the pandemic were calculated. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were described (age, gender, education level, comorbidities, disease duration, treatment). RESULTS: We included 7836 patients (22% of eligible patients), 12% of which had early disease. PROs were stable before and during the pandemic, with median changes approximating zero, as well as in patients with early disease. Remission rates were stable. The relative decrease in the number of patients with physical consultations was 21C72%, which was highest in axSpA. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were similar. Self-reported satisfaction with treatment options and access was >70%; the preferred contact form was physical consultation (66%). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide study performed during the first 8 months of the pandemic, patient satisfaction was high and the PROs and remission rates remained stable despite the remarkable reduction in physical consultations, as well as in patients with early disease.

Aim We aimed to evaluate which independent parameters are associated with risk of mortality from COVID-19 in a series that includes all Italian cases, ie, more than 4 million individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Methods We analyzed factors associated with mortality using data from the Italian national database of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, including more than 4 million cases, >415 thousand hospitalized for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and >127 thousand deceased. For patients for whom age, sex and date of infection detection were available, we determined the impact of these variables on mortality 30 days after the date of diagnosis or hospitalization. Results Multivariable Cox analysis showed that each of the analyzed variables independently affected COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, in the overall series, age was the main risk factor for mortality, with HR >100 in the age groups older than 65 years compared with a reference group of 15-44 years. Male sex presented an excess risk of death (HR = 2.1; 95% CI, 2.0-2.1). Patients infected in the first pandemic wave (before 30 June 2020) had a greater risk of death than those infected later (HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.7-2.8). Conclusions In a series of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected cases in an entire European nation, elderly age was by far the most significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, confirming that protecting the elderly should be a priority in pandemic management.

To control the infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation (COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and 350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts, opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS dataset.

To confirm its activity, in vitro cleavage reactions were performed with the synthesized ribozyme. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme were evaluated on multiplication of MHV. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme on expression of SARS-CoV were evaluated in cultured 3T3 cells. RESULT: The synthetic ribozyme cleaved the synthetic target MHV and SARS-CoV RNA into fragments of predicted length. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited multiplication of MHV in DBT cells by about 60%. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV RNA in 3T3 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid. The chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited MHV viral activity and expression of recombinant SARS RNA in vitro. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the synthetic chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme could provide a feasible treatment for SARS.","output":"Development of a Chimeric DNA-RNA Hammerhead Ribozyme Targeting SARS Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We survey the literature on the privacy of trajectory micro-data, i.e., spatiotemporal information about the mobility of individuals, whose collection is becoming increasingly simple and frequent thanks to emerging information and communication technologies.

METHODS A 10-year retrospective analysis from 2004 to 2013 of patients undergoing two-port TEP performed by a single surgeon at three surgical centers. RESULTS 336 consecutive patients underwent two-port TEP repairing 478 hernias. 315 (93.8 %) patients were male and 21 (6.2 %) were female. Mean age  SD was 47  14 years and mean body mass index  SD was 28.0  4.7 kg/m(2). Indications for surgery included primary repair 303 (90.2 %), recurrence from open repair 28 (8.3 %), and incarcerated inguinal hernia 5 (1.5 %). 194 (57.7 %) cases were unilateral and 142 (42.3 %) were bilateral. Operative time  SD was 38.7  14.9 min for unilateral repair and 43.4  17.6 min for bilateral repair. Two-port TEP was successful in 316 (94.0 %). 20 (6.0 %) cases required the addition of a third port. 2 (0.6 %) cases were converted to open repair. Mean follow-up time  SD was 5.4  2.7 years. Postoperative complications included urinary retention 5 (1.5 %), seroma 7 (2.1 %), hematoma 1 (0.3 %), surgical site infection 4 (1.2 %), and chronic inguinal pain 3 (0.9 %). 11 (2.3 %) hernias recurred. CONCLUSION Two-port TEP appears to be a feasible, safe, and effective method for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and should be considered a viable, less invasive alternative to conventional three-port techniques.","output":"Two-port totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair: a 10-year experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of Industry 4.0 technologies in the last decade, airports have undergone digitalisation to capitalise on the purported benefits of these technologies such as improved operational efficiency and passenger experience. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with emergence of its variants (e.g. Delta, Omicron) has exacerbated the need for airports to adopt new technologies such as contactless and robotic technologies to facilitate travel during this pandemic. However, there is limited knowledge of recent challenges and success factors for adoption of digital technologies in airports. Therefore, through an industry survey of airport operators and managers around the world (n=102, 0.754<Composite Reliability<0.892; conducted during COVID-19), this study identifies the challenges faced in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies (n=20) as well as enhances understanding of best practices or success factors that supported technology adoption in airports. The widely used technology, organisation, environment (TOE) framework is used as a theoretically basis for the quantitative part of the questionnaire. A complementary qualitative part is used to underpin and extend the findings. The industry survey is the first-of-its-kind that was conducted to understand the implementation challenges that airport operators face in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies in the airport.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Data from patients affected by Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (LACC), FIGO stage IB2-IVa, treated between 2015 and 2018 were extracted. Magnetic Resonance (MR), Gynecologic examination under general anesthesia (EAU), and Positron Emission TomographyCComputed Tomography (PET-CT) performed at the time of diagnosis were the items from the Electronic Health Records (eHRs) considered for analysis. An automated extraction of eHR that capture the patients data before the diagnosis and then, through Natural Language Processing (NLP), analysis and categorization of all data to transform source information into structured data has been performed. RESULTS: In the first round, the system has been used to retrieve all the eHR for the 96 patients with LACC. The system has been able to classify all patients belonging to the training set and - through the NLP procedures - the clinical features were analyzed and classified for each patient. A second important result was the setup of a predictive model to evaluate the patients staging (accuracy of 94%). Lastly, we created a user-oriented operational tool targeting the MTB who are confronted with the challenge of large volumes of patients to be diagnosed in the most accurate way.

Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections primarily on mortality, and secondarily on hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) and intensive care unit-bloodstream infection (ICU-BSI). METHODS: We conducted an observational study using prospectively collected data and HSV-1 blood and respiratory samples from all critically ill COVID-19 patients in a large reference center who underwent HSV tests. Using multivariable Cox and cause-specific (cs) models, we investigated the association between HSV reactivation and mortality or healthcare-associated infections. RESULTS: Of the 153 COVID-19 patients admitted for  48 h from Feb-2020 to Feb-2021, 40/153 (26.1%) patients had confirmed HSV-1 reactivation (19/61 (31.1%) with HSV-positive respiratory samples, and 36/146 (24.7%) with HSV-positive blood samples. Day-60 mortality was higher in patients with HSV-1 reactivation (57.5%) versus without (33.6%, p = 0.001). After adjustment for mortality risk factors, HSV-1 reactivation was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard risk [HR] 2.05; 95% CI 1.16C3.62; p = 0.01). HAP/VAP occurred in 67/153 (43.8%) and ICU-BSI in 42/153 (27.5%) patients. In patients with HSV-1 reactivation, multivariable cause-specific models showed an increased risk of HAP/VAP (csHR 2.38, 95% CI 1.06C5.39, p = 0.037), but not of ICU-BSI.

Currently, hormone replacement therapy for POI has some limitations, either with low efficacies or high side effects. Bushen Huoxue (BSHX) plays an important role in alleviating clinical symptoms and improving health status of POI patients. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, and multicenter clinical trial protocol aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BSHX in women with POI. METHODS AND DESIGN: We plan to recruit 150 women with POI from four participating hospitals in China. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 to receive oral BSHX or BSHX placebo. All participants will be treated for 3 months and will be followed up for another 3 month. The primary outcome is questionnaire scores based on the changes in the total symptoms, which is the Chinese version of the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (CMS) (Nie G, Yang H, Liu J, Zhao C, Wang X, Menopause 24(5):546C554, 2017). CMS will be measured before the intervention, at 3 months and 6 months after randomization for all participants. The other measurements include serum sex hormone levels, anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) levels, ovarian peak systolic velocity (PSV; cm/s), and antral follicle count (AFC). In this study, the regulatory effects of traditional Chinese medicine on hormones were evaluated by the changes of serum sex hormone levels, which include serum estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These indicators will be measured before intervention and at 3 months after randomization.

In order for pig production to become less of a threat to the environment, excreta must contain as little P as possible or be efficiently used by plants. This must be achieved without decreasing the livestock performance. Phosphorus and calcium (Ca) deposition in the bones of growing pigs must be optimised without affecting the muscle gain. This requires precision feeding based on cutting-edge techniques of diet formulation throughout the animal growth phase. Modelling and data mining have become important tools in this quest. In this study, a mechanistic model taking into account the distribution of P between bone and soft tissues was compared to the established factorial models (INRA (Jondreville and Dourmad, 2005) and NRC (National Research Council, 2012)) that predict P (apparent total tract digestible, ATTD-P; or standardised total tract digestible, STTD-P) and Ca (total and STTD) requirements as a function of BW and protein deposition. The requirements for different bone mineralisation scenarios, namely, 100% and 85% of the genetic potential, were compared with these two models. Sobol indices were used to estimate the relative impact of growth-related parameters on mineral requirements at 30, 60 and 120 kg of BW. The INRA showed the highest value of ATTD-P requirement between 29 and 103 kg of BW (6%) and lower for lighter and higher BW. Similarly, the model for 85% bone mineralisation showed lower STTD-P requirement than NRC between 29 and 93 kg of BW (7%) and higher for lighter and higher BW. Contrary to other models, the Ca requirement of the proposed model is not fixed in relation to P. It increases from 95 kg of BW while the others decrease. The INRA showed the highest Ca requirements. The model Ca requirements for 100% bone mineralisation are higher than NRC from 20 to 38 kg of BW similar until 70 kg of BW and then higher again. For 85% objective, the model showed lower Ca requirements from 25 to 82 kg of BW and higher for lighter and higher BW. The potential Ca deposition in bones is the most sensitive parameter (84% to 100% of the variance) of both ATTD-P and Ca at 30, 60 and 120 kg. The second most sensitive parameter is the protein deposition, explaining 1% to 15% of the ATTD-P variance.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, the proportion of direct visits to hospitals through public emergency medical services (EMS) increased, and the onset of symptoms-to-ED door time via the public EMS was delayed (87 min vs. 68 min, p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of AIS patients during the COVID-19 outbreak was worse than that of pre-COVID-19 patients with delays at the prehospital stage, despite the need for timely care.","output":"Delays in the Management of Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke during the COVID-19 Outbreak Period: A Multicenter Study in Daegu, Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the technology advances, the modern trend of lifestyle also advances.

Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV pandemic infected over 8,500 individuals, claimed over 800 lives and cost billions of dollars in economic loss worldwide, there still are no clinically approved antiviral drugs, vaccines or monoclonal antibody therapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. The recent emergence of the deadly human coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a sobering reminder that new and deadly coronaviruses can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Therefore, the continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures to potentially deadly coronaviruses is warranted. The coronaviral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), are attractive antiviral drug targets because they are essential for coronaviral replication. Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro are to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to aid coronaviruses in their evasion of the host innate immune responses. Therefore, targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs may have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells. This review provides an up-to-date discussion on the SARS-CoV papain-like protease including a brief overview of the SARS-CoV genome and replication followed by a more in-depth discussion on the structure and catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLpro, the multiple cellular functions of SARS-CoV PLpro, the inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro by small molecule inhibitors, and the prospect of inhibiting papain-like protease from other coronaviruses.

Because complement activation with subsequent anaphylatoxin release is in the core of innate immune stimulation, studying the relationship between complement activation and cytokine release in an in vitro CS model holds promise to better understand CS and identify new therapies against it. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in the presence of autologous serum to test the impact of complement activation and inhibition on cytokine release, testing the effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), zymosan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as immune activators and heat inactivation of serum, EDTA and mini-factor H (mfH) as complement inhibitors. These activators induced significant rises of complement activation markers C3a, C4a, C5a, Ba, Bb, and sC5b-9 at 45 min of incubation, with or without ~5- to ~2,000-fold rises of IL-1, IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNF at 6 and 18 h later. Inhibition of complement activation by the mentioned three methods had differential inhibition, or even stimulation of certain cytokines, among which effects a limited suppressive effect of mfH on IL-6 secretion and significant stimulation of IL-10 implies anti-CS and anti-inflammatory impacts. These findings suggest the utility of the model for in vitro studies on CS, and the potential clinical use of mfH against CS.","output":"Mini-Factor H Modulates Complement-Dependent IL-6 and IL-10 Release in an Immune Cell Culture (PBMC) Model: Potential Benefits Against Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has historically been diagnosed phenotypically. Through genetic testing, identification of a molecular diagnosis (MolDx) is increasingly common but the impact on pediatric patients is unknown. This was a retrospective study of next-generation sequencing data for 602 pediatric patients with a clinician-reported history of HCM. Diagnostic yield was stratified by gene and self-reported race/ethnicity. A MolDx of HCM was identified in 242 (40%) individuals. Sarcomeric genes were the highest yielding, but pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in syndromic genes were found in 36% of individuals with a MolDx, often in patients without documented clinical suspicion for a genetic syndrome. Among all MolDx, 73% were in genes with established clinical management recommendations and 2.9% were in genes that conferred eligibility for clinical trial enrollment. Black patients were the least likely to receive a MolDx. In the current era, genetic testing can impact management of HCM, beyond diagnostics or prognostics, through disease-specific guidelines or clinical trial eligibility. Genetic testing frequently can help identify syndromes in patients for whom syndromes may not be suspected. These findings highlight the importance of pursuing broad genetic testing, independent of suspicion based on phenotype. Lower rates of MolDx in Black patients may contribute to health inequities. Further research is needed evaluating the genetics of HCM in underrepresented/underserved populations. Additionally, research related to the impact of genetic testing on clinical management of other diseases is warranted.

The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more quantitative assessment is rarely performed. METHODS: We calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 &#8728;C to the fully matched reference temperature. RESULTS: We obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to 21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered. However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Some primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account. Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid undesired cross-reactivity.","output":"Thermodynamic evaluation of the impact of DNA mismatches in PCR-type SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To define the uniqueness of chest CT infiltrative features associated with COVID-19 image characteristics as potential diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively. In an attempt to discriminate COVID-19 from CAP, we developed several classifiers based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP. The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. RESULTS: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85). This model allowed for the identification of 8-50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases.

Poor families, with low access to formal credit and who rely heavily on informal mechanisms for consumption smoothing have lower chances of working remotely than richer families with higher access to formal credit.

Additionally, direct and significant associations were identified between the use of certain coping strategies, stress levels, and resilience. The conclusions of this research are essential for effective stress detection, and therefore, early intervention in the field of educational psychology, by discussing the influence of resilience or lack thereof on the prediction of stress levels.

Psychological therapies are considered first-line intervention for people with chronic pain. Common psychological therapies require extensive clinician training and specialist qualifications. One approach that does not need lengthy training nor specialist qualification, but has empirical support in other health domains, is behavioural activation (BA). BA seeks to increase engagement in behaviours that are valued by the person and progress through behaviours that can increase mood and develop skills that build satisfying routines. BA can help people to manage their condition through scheduling behaviours, promoting routine and mastery over their condition. The extent to which BA has been used to support people living with chronic pain is not clear. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review aims to identify published studies describing the application of BA to support people living with chronic pain. To map the evidence regarding BA and chronic pain, including the study type and the associated evidence, a scoping review was adopted. The search will be conducted in bibliographic databases, clinical trial registries and grey literature. No date limits will be applied to the search strategy. Screening of titles and abstracts, and full-text screening, will be independently undertaken by two investigators using Covidence software. Any disagreement between investigators will be resolved by a third investigator. Data from included publications will be extracted using a customised data extraction tool.

This study aimed to identify the magnitude, characteristics and underlying motivations of ED visitors with delayed healthcare seeking behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Between March 9 and July 92,020, adults visiting the ED of an academic hospital in the East of the Netherlands received an online questionnaire to collect self-reported data on delay in seeking emergency care and subsequent motivations for this delay. Telephone interviews were held with a subsample of respondents to better understand the motivations for delay as described in the questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred thirty-eight questionnaires were returned (34.0% response). One in five respondents reported a delay in seeking emergency care. Almost half of these respondents (n = 126; 45.4%) reported that the pandemic influenced the delay. Respondents reporting delay were mainly older adults (mean 61.6; 13.1 years), referred to the ED by the general practitioner (GP; 35.1%) or a medical specialist (34.7%), visiting the ED with cardiac problems (39.7%). The estimated median time of delay in receiving ED care was 3 days (inter quartile range 8 days). Respectively 46 (16.5%) and 26 (9.4%) respondents reported that their complaints would be either less severe or preventable if they had sought for emergency care earlier. Delayed care seeking behaviour was frequently motivated by: fear of contamination, not wanting to burden professionals, perceiving own complaints less urgent relative to COVID-19 patients, limited access to services, and by stay home instructions from referring professionals. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively large proportion of ED visitors reported delay in seeking emergency care during the first wave. Delay was often driven by misperceptions of the accessibility of services and the legitimacy for seeking emergency care. Public messaging and close collaboration between the ED and referring professionals could help reduce delayed care for acute needs during future COVID-19 infection waves.","output":"Delayed emergency healthcare seeking behaviour by Dutch emergency department visitors during the first COVID-19 wave: a mixed methods retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen with a broad host range.

The fusion and genome delivery steps can be completed at variable times and places, either at or near cell surfaces or deep within endosomes.

However, information on the microplastic core bacteria from the river ecosystems is poor. Here, we investigated the composition and function of microplastic core bacteria from the Three Gorges Reservoir area along the approximate 662 km of the Yangtze River via full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, compared with those in water, sediment, and soil. The results showed that the spatial turnover of bacterial communities in four habitats supported deterministic processes dominated by niche differentiation, which shaped their core bacteria. The composition and function of microplastic core bacteria were significantly different from those in the other three habitats. Rhodobacteraceae was the main component of microplastic core bacteria, while the main component of core bacteria in water, sediment, and soil were Burkholderiaceae (21.90%), Burkholderiaceae (5.01%), Nitrosomonadaceae (4.61%), respectively. Furthermore, microplastic core bacteria had stronger geographic limitations along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Stronger geographic limitations shaped the rapid community turnover and a potentially more connected network for the microplastic core bacteria than water, sediment, and soil. More importantly, microplastic core bacteria had strong potential functions of drug resistance and could cause risks to ecosystems and human health. Microplastic core bacteria were mainly influenced by sediment core bacteria, although the bacteria colonizing on microplastics could be from all the contact environments and original sources.

Based on 2002 and 2012 input-output tables and a large data set of production and foreign trade, we estimate the production and imported input use for 20 sectors, mainly from the manufacturing industry. We calculate import requirement ratios, comprising both direct and indirect effects, for each sector using the Leontief inverse matrix. Our findings indicate that import dependency increases for exports, but stays relatively stable for production over time. In general, the import content of production is lower than that of exports. This difference is mainly attributable to the services sector, which has low import dependency, yet a large share in production. Sectors with the highest import requirements are those with higher capital and technology intensity, such as petroleum products, basic metals, and motor vehicles.

Methods: Multicenter prospective registry of consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia aged 18-65 years between March and May 2020. We considered a composite outcome of poor outcome including intensive care unit admission and/or use of noninvasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapies and/or death. Results: We identified 513 patients <65 years of age, from a cohort of 993 patients. 102 had poor outcomes (19.8%) and 3.9% died. 78% and 55% of patients with poor outcomes were classified as low risk based on CURB and PSI scores respectively.

In 2012, ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing reclassified both as N. mucosa, but data concerning 17 N. sicca strains remain available in GenBank. The continuous progress of high-throughput sequencing has facilitated ready accessibility of whole-genome data, promoting vigorous development of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and high-resolution phylogenetic analysis. Here, we report that a Neisseria isolate, which caused native-valve endocarditis and multiple embolic brain infarcts in a patient with congenital heart disease, was misidentified as N. sicca by VITEK MS. This isolate was reclassified as N. mucosa by ANI blast (ANIb) and by phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome data yielded by the PacBio Sequel and Illumina NovaSeq PE150 platforms. The confusion evident in the GenBank and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) databases suggests that N. mucosa (n = 13) and N. sicca (n = 16) in GenBank should be reclassified using ANIb and high-resolution phylogenetic analysis. The whole-genome data of 30 strains (including the clinical isolate) were compared with the data of 27 type Neisseria strains (including one N. sicca and two N. mucosa type strains) as a genomic index. In total, 25 (8 originally identified as N. mucosa and 17 originally identified as N. sicca) and 7 (1 originally identified as N. sicca and 6 originally identified as N. mucosa) strains were reclassified into the N. mucosa and Neisseria subflava groups, respectively; 1 residual N. mucosa strain was reclassified as Neisseria meningitidis. In conclusion, a combination of ANIb and robust phylogenetic analysis reclassified strains originally identified as N. mucosa and N. sicca into (principally) the N. mucosa group and the N. subflava group.

METHODS A cohort comprised of 567 patients with COVID-19 at a large acute care healthcare system between 10 February 2020 and 7 April 2020 observed until either death or discharge. Random forest (RF) model was developed on randomly drawn 70% of the cohort (training set) and its performance was evaluated on the rest of 30% (the test set). The outcome variable was in-hospital mortality within 20-84 hours from the time of prediction. Input features included patients' vital signs, laboratory data and ECG results. RESULTS Patients had a median age of 60.2 years (IQR 26.2 years); 54.1% were men. In-hospital mortality rate was 17.0% and overall median time to death was 6.5 days (range 1.3-23.0 days). In the test set, the RF classifier yielded a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI: 78.2% to 94.3%), specificity of 60.6% (95% CI: 55.2% to 65.8%), accuracy of 65.5% (95% CI: 60.7% to 70.0%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 85.5% (95% CI: 80.8% to 90.2%) and area under the precision recall curve of 64.4% (95% CI: 53.5% to 75.3%).

In the separation narrative, work and family belong to different realms, and including the family in the domain of organizational responsibility is seen as pointless. The interdependence narrative stresses that organizations and families are overlapping domains in which it is important to acknowledge that the policies and practices of the former might have an impact on family life, and vice-versa. The embeddedness narrative, brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic, sees employment and family as progressively convergent and hybrid work domains.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted among pregnant women presenting for care at 3 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Women with reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results positive for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from April 2 to June 13, 2020, and follow-up occurred through July 10, 2020. Contemporaneous participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as a convenience sample from pregnant women with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2. EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, defined by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal plasma or respiratory fluids and umbilical cord plasma, quantification of antiCSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in maternal and cord plasma, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the placenta. RESULTS: Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 with RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [5.6] years) and 63 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [5.4] years) provided samples for analysis. Of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) were asymptomatic, 22 (34%) had mild disease, 7 (11%) had moderate disease, 10 (16%) had severe disease, and 2 (3%) had critical disease. In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested in whom SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified in cord blood, 1 had detectable immunoglobuilin M to nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any. In antibody analyses among 37 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, antiCreceptor binding domain immunoglobin G was detected in 24 women (65%) and anti-nucleocapsid was detected in 26 women (70%).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020. METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively. RESULTS: The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China.

Given the concern for increased viral shedding by corticosteroids, as observed with previous coronavirus strains, it is not known what impact ICS cause in terms of COVID-19 positivity or disease severity in COPD patients. Methods: This study examined 27,810 patients with COPD from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry between March and September 2020. Electronic health records (EHR) were used to determine diagnosis of COPD, ICS use, and clinical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics and comorbidities known to be associated with increased risk for severe Coronavirus disease-19 disease. Findings: Amongst the COPD patients who were tested for COVID-19, 44.1% of those taking an ICS-containing inhaler tested positive for COVID-19 versus 47.2% who tested negative (p=0.033). Of those who tested positive, (n=1288), 371 (28.8%) required hospitalization. In-hospital outcomes were not significantly different when comparing ICS versus no ICS in terms of developing sepsis (28.4% vs 26.5%, p=0.77), ICU admission (36.8% vs 31.2%, p=0.30), endotracheal intubation (21.9% vs 16.5%, p=0.24), or mortality (18.4% vs 20.0%, p=0.80).

In response to social distancing requirements, social workers, but not interns, were granted access to work remotely. Virtual programming became necessary to meet the interns' remaining educational requirements and provided an opportunity for proper termination from the program. This article will delineate the program redesign for oncology social work interns using remote/virtual modalities. This melded approach involved creating simulated clinical interactions, based on selected points along the illness trajectory targeting specific clinical competencies, which were presented to interns by phone and/or videoconference. Examples will be provided related to developing clinical skills and critical thinking and preparing for professional responsibilities within a broad range of healthcare settings. Guidelines for working with individuals, couples/families, and groups will be included. Issues of individual and group supervision will be explored, with sensitivity to the parallel experience of existential uncertainty and mortality awareness among the interns in the context of the pandemic. Although in-person training is preferable, there are advantages to virtual learning for both supervisors and interns. This creative adaptation of field education provides an innovative programming model that can be used to enhance the experience for social work interns moving forward in various healthcare settings during ordinary or extraordinary circumstances.","output":"COVID-19 and Beyond: A Prototype for Remote/Virtual Social Work Field Placement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to validate the genetic selection for resistance to streptococcosis under experimental challenge conditions in a commercial population of Nile tilapia. Further, effects of using two different routes of infection of Streptococcus agalactiae; intraperitoneal injection (IP) and cohabitation with the shedder fish (cohab), on the genomic parameters, prediction accuracy and response to selection are compared. The comparison was made between two different lines of fish; one selected for S. agalactiae resistance for one generation and randomly mated for two generations (to mimic the multiplication activities occurring in distribution channels and hatcheries); and the other unselected. 1,500 fish, each from these two lines, were used for the experimental challenge test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Hazard's ratio was used to quantify differences in mortality between the two lines. Further genomic analysis was performed with 2,684 fish and 35,745 SNPs using both univariate and bivariate GBLUP models. Genetic selection for resistance to S. agalactiae led to the significant (p < .001) reduction in the risk of death by 65% in the selected line, compared to the unselected line. Similarly, the risk of death via cohabitation route of infection significantly (p < .01) decreased by 80%, compared to IP. The genetic correlation between these two routes of infection was ~0.9. Genetic selection changed the impact of the routes of infection, with the change in the distribution of estimated breeding values and the gain of 3.04  1.25 days as selection response (p < .05).","output":"Experimental validation of genetic selection for resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae via different routes of infection in the commercial Nile tilapia breeding programme."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a functionally limiting disorder secondary to increased intracranial pressures (ICPs) with a prevalence of one per 100,000 persons.

The pathophysiology is unknown but postulated to involve increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. Traditional treatments involve weight loss, acetazolamide, CSF diversion, or optic nerve fenestration. More recent technology has allowed exploration of venous sinus stenosis. Through venous sinus stenting (VSS), the ICPs and venous sinus pressures decrease. After treatment, >75% exhibit an improvement in headaches, ~50% improvement in tinnitus, and ~50 % improvement in ophthalmologic testing.

This is due to reductions in elective operating, clinic cancellations and redeployment of doctors to medical wards. Surgical education has evolved to address anxieties from staff about missing out on valuable skills and experience. Although there has been a big emphasis on virtual learning, in-person simulation remains highly relevant. The Double 2s MDT Surgical Emergencies Course was piloted amidst the pandemic at UHBW Foundation Trust. Places were restricted in view of social distancing (n = 13). Foundation doctors and nurses engaged in two simulation sessions based around acutely deteriorating surgical patients. Feedback was collected anonymously via an online google form. All participants agreed that the course was pertinent to their clinical practice. 77 and 100% learners felt that their confidence had improved in assessing and managing surgical emergencies respectively. The feedback shows that simulation can and should be employed alongside virtual learning to maintain the integrity of surgical education. Whilst the situation may eventually return to business as normal, the Double 2s course is appropriate to run again during winter pressures which may have similar implications for surgical training. It could also be adapted for medical students and higher surgical trainees.","output":"374 Simulation and the Surgeon during COVID-19: The Double 2s Surgical Emergencies Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) affects up to one in two critically ill patients. The cellular mechanisms of kidney tubule repair after acute kidney injury are poorly characterized in humans. Methods: We recruited 5 patients admitted to the Geneva University Hospital's Intensive Care Unit for severe COVID19 and experiencing AKI. For each of them, a kidney biopsy was performed before the planned withdrawal of resuscitation measures. We further applied single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the kidney in the first days after acute injury. Results: After data processing and quality control, we obtained 20,165 single-cell transcriptomes. The most prominent finding in the snRNAseq analyses was in the proximal tubule (PT) compartment. We defined two cell populations corresponding to mature and undifferentiated PT cells, connected by two cell state transitions (Figure 1). Undifferentiated PT cells display an injured pattern characterized by metabolic impairment, reduction of the tubule transport function, and expression of injury markers confirmed in immunochemistry. We found that tubule repair follows two converging patterns involving the plasticity of mature tubule cells and the expansion and differentiation of progenitor-like cells. Tubule repair by cell plasticity displayed substantial similarities among mice and men and determined the transient expansion of undifferentiated tubule cells with altered functional and metabolic properties. Progenitorlike cells marked by PROM1 proliferated in response to injury and followed a differentiation process characterized by the sequential activation of the WNT, NOTCH, and HIPPO signaling pathways. Conclusions: Here we generated the first map of PT injury and repair in humans. Taken together, our analyses reveal cell states transitions and fundamental cellular hierarchies underlying kidney injury and repair in patients.","output":"Single cell profiling in COVID-19 associated acute kidney injury reveals patterns of tubule injury and repair in human"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Survey responses from a sample of nearly 15,000 Australian sports fans were used to study the determinants of: (i) gambling behaviour, including if a person does gamble and the type of gambling engaged with; (ii) the number of sports and non-sports bets made over a 12-month period; and (iii) attitudes towards betting on sports. The probability of betting on sports decreased with increasing age and was lower for women and people with a university education. This gender difference varied with age, with the greatest difference found among the young. Similar effects were observed for the number of sports bets made, which declined with age. The gender difference in the number of sports bets also varied with age with the greatest difference found among the young arising from the high propensity of young men to bet on sports. Attitudes to sports betting were also analysed, with a key finding that, within friendship circles, the views that sports betting is perceived as harmless, common and very much a part of enjoying sports were stronger among young men. These permissive attitudes were stronger among people who bet on sports and those who bet on sports more frequently. The analysis of sports fans provides insights into the characteristics of the target market most likely to bet on sports, which can be used to inform public health initiatives and harm reduction campaigns.

The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model. The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19. In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting. We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect). For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting. Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening and provides potential outcomes for policymakers.","output":"A Spatial-Temporal Graph Based Hybrid Infectious Disease Model with Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND : The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how maternity care services are provided worldwide. In an effort to contain the virus many providers have reduced the number of face-to-face visits for women. In addition, partner attendance is now prohibited in many circumstances in order to protect staff, and other service users, from potential infection. METHODS : A qualitative study with 14 women was conducted using a grounded theory approach. Data were collected between April to June 2020 and in-depth interviews were conducted either in pregnancy or in the first 12 weeks after the birth. RESULTS : Six categories emerged: loss of normality, navigating \\"new\\" maternity care systems, partners as bystanders, balancing information, uncertainty and unexpected benefits of pregnancy during the pandemic. Women described the challenges they faced with accessing information of the risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy and how to navigate the new hospital and community restrictions. For the most part women accepted many of the restrictions as they understood as being in place to keep them safe. They perceived themselves as vulnerable group despite apparent available evidence to the contrary. The loss of the partner as an advocate, particularly at the anomaly scan and in the neonatal intensive care, was a source of anxiety. Social media was the main source of information for many in place of traditional sources such as healthcare providers. Some unexpected benefits of restrictions included working from home which allowed women to manage normal pregnancy symptoms such as fatigue at home. CONCLUSION : The pandemic caused anxiety for pregnant women. This is exacerbated by uncertainty about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and unclear messaging about restrictions. Pregnancy has a significant temporal component and so maternity services need to respond to womens needs for information and support rapidly and effectively, with more interactive and personalised communication to support them to cope with uncertainty. The birth partner is an important role as an advocate for women. Containment strategies for the pandemic should be developed with this in mind and attempt to view the family as a unit rather than the woman in isolation.","output":"Womens Experience of Pregnancy and Birth during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in widespread disruption to the healthcare industry Alongside complex issues relating to ensuring sufficient healthcare capacity and resourcing, healthcare organisations and universities are now also facing heightened cyber-security threats in the midst of the pandemic Since the outbreak began various healthcare providers and academic institutions across the world have been targeted in a variety of complex and coordinatized cyber-attacks International and national regulatory bodies have stressed the urgent need for healthcare providers and universities to protect themselves against cyber-attacks during COVID-19, recognising that a growing number of cyber-criminals are seeking to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of the healthcare sector during this period This includes a desire to steal intellectual property such as data relating to COVID-19 vaccine development, modelling and experimental therapeutics It is therefore essential that healthcare providers and universities ensure they are informed, protected and prepared to respond to any cyber-threat This article outlines key COVID-19 cyber-security principles for both healthcare organisations and academic institutions","output":"Healthcare Cyber-Attacks and the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Urgent Threat to Global Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a national survey of Generation Z conducted in late May 2020, we measure attitudes about the impact of the coronavirus on personal health, financial and job concerns, views about shelter-in-place laws, and 2020 voting intentions.

The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5  1.7 m to 183  2.8 m). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch. This study provides evidence for the potential use of bycatch from shrimp fisheries as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals.","output":"Preparation and Characterization of Microcapsules Containing Antioxidant Fish Protein Hydrolysates: a New Use of Bycatch in Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Many children diagnosed with COVID-19 infections did not require hospitalisation. Our objective was to analyse electrocardiographic changes in children with asymptomatic, mild or moderate COVID-19 who did not require hospitalisation. METHODS All children are seen in a paediatric cardiology clinic who had asymptomatic, mild or moderate COVID-19 that did not require hospitalisation and had at least one electrocardiogram after their diagnosis were included in this retrospective analysis. Records were reviewed to determine COVID-19 disease severity and presence of Long COVID. Rhythm assessment, atrial enlargement, ventricular hypertrophy, PR/QRS/QT interval duration and ST-T wave abnormalities were analysed by a paediatric electrophysiologist. Clinically ordered echocardiograms were reviewed for signs of myopericarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction and pericardial effusion) on any subject with an electrocardiographic abnormality. RESULTS Of the 82 children meeting inclusion criteria (14.4 years, range 1-18 years, 57% male), 17 patients (21%) demonstrated electrocardiographic changes. Ten patients (12%) had electrocardiogram of borderline significance, which included isolated mild PR prolongation or mild repolarisation abnormalities. The other seven patients (9%) had concerning electrocardiographic findings consisting of more significant repolarisation abnormalities. None of the patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram revealed any echocardiographic abnormality. All abnormal electrocardiograms normalised over time except in two cases. Across the entire cohort, greater COVID-19 disease severity and long COVID were not associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Currently, there are limited effective medications approved for this deadly disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential predictors of COVID-19 mortality and risk factors for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was carried out in 1,149 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, from 1/13/2020 to 3/15/2020. RESULTS: We found significant differences in the rates of hyperuricemia (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 2.13-4.70; p < 0.001) and hypoalbuminemia (OR: 5.68, 95% CI: 3.97-8.32; p < 0.001) between deceased and recovered patients. The percentages of hyperuricemia in deceased patients and recovered patients were 23.6% and 8.9%, respectively, which were higher than the reported age-standardized prevalence of 6.2% in Chinese population. Of note, the percentages of both IL-6 and uric acid levels in survived COVID-19 patients were above 90%, suggesting that they might be good specificity for indicators of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The serum level of uric acid (UA) was positively associated with ferritin, TNF-, and IL-6 but not with anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, the levels of these proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients showed a trend of reduction after uric acid lowering therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism, was increased in deceased patients with COVID-19. In addition, the serum level of uric acid was positively associated with inflammatory markers. Uric acid lowering therapy in COVID-19 patients with hyperuricemia may be beneficial.","output":"Laboratory Predictors of COVID-19 Mortality: A Retrospective Analysis from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection of the oviduct by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in laying hens has been associated with the false layer syndrome. Because the diagnostic procedure for the detection of cystic oviducts by postmortem examinations in IBV-positive replacement pullet flocks could involve the unnecessary sacrifice of numerous healthy pullets without reproductive tract anomalies, the development of a noninvasive and nonlethal diagnostic procedure would be desirable. The first objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a transcutaneous ultrasonography method to predict the presence of cystic oviducts compared to postmortem examinations in a commercial pullet flock positive for an IBV genotype Delmarva (DMV) variant. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of the same ultrasonography method to later detect false layers in the same flock in sexually mature hens by identifying the presence of an egg in the oviduct due to the presence of atretic oviducts undetectable by ultrasonography and the absence of cystic oviducts at that age. In replacement pullets, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the ultrasonography (index test) compared to the postmortem examination (reference standard test) were 73% and 91%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 67% and 93%. The ultrasonography technique showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 7.82 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.30. In sexually mature hens, the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of the ultrasonography compared to the laying status were 98%. The LR+ was 49.00 and the LR- was 0.02 when compared to the laying status. In conclusion, the ultrasonography could replace postmortem examinations to detect cystic oviducts in commercial flocks of replacement pullets previously infected with an IBV-DMV 1639 variant. Although the test accuracy of ultrasonography was excellent for the hens at production peak to identify laying and nonlaying hens based on the presence of an egg in the reproductive tract, its practicality was limited due to atretic oviducts being not detectable.","output":"Diagnostic Accuracy of Ultrasonography to Detect False Layers in a Commercial Laying Flock Infected by an Infectious Bronchitis Virus Delmarva Genotype Causing Cystic Oviducts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Wuhan City has ended the lockdown and people have been allowed to resume working since April 8 if meeting a set of COVID\\\\19\\\\associated tests including SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 nucleic acid test (NAT) of nasopharyngeal swabs, chest CT scan or a SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific serological test.

METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84  2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02  12.46). RESULTS: we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students.

This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002C2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (0.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person.

Given a masked face image, the former predicts a 3DMM-based reconstructed face together with a binary occlusion map, providing dense geometrical and textural priors that greatly facilitate the inpainting task of the latter.

Our survey was conducted online because of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in 2518 responses to a questionnaire targeted at three specific groups with particular information needs: parents of young children, pregnant women and the elderly ( 60 years). RESULTS: Our main findings are that currently vaccine PPLs are rarely used and frequently unavailable for the vaccinee. Across the four countries surveyed 55C82% of vaccinees would accept an electronic version, as did 64% when there was an option to request a printout of the leaflet. CONCLUSIONS: We found that switching to electronic versions of vaccine PPLs is an acceptable alternative for the public, potentially increasing the quality and amount of information reaching vaccinees while eliminating some barriers to redistribution of vaccines between countries.

CMS has updated the reimbursement structure of Medicare and Medicaid to incentivize more SDOH-related interventions. Providers are also growing increasingly attentive to the SDOH needs of their patients, but often are unable to sufficiently address them outside of care settings. The combination of increased SDOH funding with inefficient mechanisms to meet patients' SDOH needs has led to the emergence of the for-profit SDOH industry.

We aim at providing criteria for these decisions without knowing the SARS-CoV-2 test result in suspected cases. SETTING: Tertiary emergency medicine. PARTICIPANTS: All patients were treated at the ED of the Charit during the pandemic peak and underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with positive test results were characterised in detail and underwent a 14-day-follow-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were performed to identify predictors (primary endpoint), which confirm safe discharge. The clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality or need for mechanical ventilation during index stay or after readmission. RESULTS: The primary test population of suspected COVID-19 consisted of n=1255 cases, 45.2% were women (n=567). Of these, n=110 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (8.8%). The median age of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases was 45 years (IQR: 33-66 years), whereas the median age of the group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 years (IQR: 30-60 years) (p=0.096). 43.6% were directly admitted to hospital care.CART analysis identified the variables oxygen saturation (<95%), dyspnoea and history of cardiovascular (CV) disease to distinguish between high and low-risk groups.

As a compensatory response, plasma HCO3concentration decreases if pCO2decreases and increases conversely. These secondary responses prevent large pH fluctuations. However, metabolic acid-base disorders may still occur as a consequence of dysfunction of other organs and/or medical treatments. To recognize superimposed acid-base disorders, the availability of an accurate prediction of the expected HCO3that corresponds to a given pCO2is crucial. In chronic hypocapnia, the compensatory metabolic response is regulated by the equation HCO3/pCO2=0.4 mEq/L per mm Hg. An easy rule to compute the expected value of HCO3may be 0.4pCO2+9. In chronic hypercapnia, the equation is HCO3/pCO2=0.48 mEq/L per mm Hg, and the expected value of HCO3becomes 0.48pCO2+4.74. While this expression is accurate, it seems to be of limited use for simple \\"bedside\\" predictions. In this contribution, we propose the simpler expression: the expected value of HCO3in chronic hypercapnia=? pCO2+3.5. For values of pCO2not exceeding 70 mm Hg, with the proposed expression, the difference in HCO3prediction in respect to the previous one is &lt;0.5 mEq/L, which is clinically negligible. The root mean square value of the error introduced by the proposed expression is as small as 0.19 mEq/L. Because of its accuracy, we believe that the proposed formula may be useful to identify mixed disorders at the bedside in a simpler way.","output":"Bedside Rules for Managing Acid-Base Derangement in Respiratory Failure: Applications to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Voice based Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) promise to improve healthcare management and Quality of Life (QOL) by introducing the paradigm of hands free and eye free interactions.

Peptide vaccine formulations consist of multiple synthetic linear epitopes that together trigger desired immune responses that can result in robust immune memory. The advantages of linear compared to conformational epitopes are their simple structure, ease of synthesis, and ability to stimulate immune responses by means that do not require complex 3D conformation. Prediction of linear epitopes through use of computational tools is fast and cost-effective, but typically of low accuracy, necessitating extensive experimentation to verify results. On the other hand, identification of linear epitopes through experimental screening has been an inefficient process that requires thorough characterization of previously identified full-length protein antigens, or laborious techniques involving genetic manipulation of organisms. In this study, we apply a newly developed generalizable screening method that enables efficient identification of B-cell epitopes in the proteomes of pathogenic bacteria. As a test case, we used this method to identify epitopes in the proteome of Francisella tularensis (Ft), a Select Agent with a well-characterized immunoproteome. Our screen identified many peptides that map to known antigens, including verified and predicted outer membrane proteins and extracellular proteins, validating the utility of this approach. We then used the method to identify seroreactive peptides in the less characterized immunoproteome of Select Agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). This screen revealed known Bp antigens as well as proteins that have not been previously identified as antigens. Although B-cell epitope prediction tools Bepipred 2.0 and iBCE-EL classified many of our seroreactive peptides as epitopes, they did not score them significantly higher than the non-reactive tryptic peptides in our study, nor did they assign higher scores to seroreactive peptides from known Ft or Bp antigens, highlighting the need for experimental data instead of relying on computational epitope predictions alone. The present workflow is easily adaptable to detecting peptide targets relevant to the immune systems of other mammalian species, including humans (depending upon the availability of convalescent sera from patients), and could aid in accelerating the discovery of B-cell epitopes and development of vaccines to counter emerging biological threats.","output":"Shotgun Immunoproteomic Approach for the Discovery of Linear B-Cell Epitopes in Biothreat Agents Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the ubiquity of mobile applications (apps) in daily lives, understanding and reflecting end-users' human values (e.g., transparency, privacy, social recognition etc.) in apps has become increasingly important.

The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19-related UMVs after outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were from the Optum? de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record database from June 1 to December 9, 2020. Adults with first COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in outpatient settings were identified. Cumulative incidence function analysis stratified by risk factors was used to estimate the 30-day incidence of COVID-19-related UMVs. Competing risk regression models were used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with UMVs. RESULTS: Among 206,741 patients [58.8% female, 77.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian, mean (SD) age: 46.7 (17.8) years], the 30-day incidence was 9.4% (95% CI 9.3-9.6) for COVID-19-related emergency room (ER)/urgent care (UC)/hospitalizations and 3.8% (95% CI 3.7-3.9) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Likelihood of hospitalization increased with age and body mass index, with age the strongest risk factor (aHR 5.61; 95% CI 4.90-6.32 for patients &#8805; 85 years). Increased likelihood of hospitalization was observed for first presentation in the ER/UC vs. non-ER/UC outpatient settings (aHR 2.35; 95% CI 2.22-2.47) and prior all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.00). Clinical risk factors of hospitalizations included pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disease. A study limitation is that data on COVID-19 severity and symptoms were not captured. CONCLUSION: Predictors of COVID-19-related UMVs include older age, obesity, and several comorbidities.

Clinically, influenza virus and Streptococcus suis co-infections in pigs are very common, which often contribute to severe pneumonia and can increase the mortality. However, the co-infection pathogenesis in pigs is unclear. In the present study, co-infection experiments were performed using swine H1N1 influenza virus and Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). The H1N1-SS2 co-infected pigs exhibited more severe clinical symptoms, serious pathological changes, and robust apoptosis of lungs at 6 days post-infection compared with separate H1N1 and SS2 infections. A comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach was performed to investigate the global host responses of swine lungs against the swine H1N1 infection, SS2 infection, co-infection, and phosphate-buffered saline control. Results showed 457, 411, and 844 differentially expressed genes in the H1N1, SS2, and H1N1-SS2 groups, respectively, compared with the control. Noticeably, genes associated with the immune, inflammatory, and apoptosis responses were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group. Pathway analysis indicated that the cytokineCcytokine receptor interactions, MAPK, toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis pathway were significantly regulated in the co-infected group. However, the genes related to these were less regulated in the separate H1N1 and SS2 infection groups.

In the past few decades, Wavelet-based DR classification has shown successful impacts and the Deep Learning models, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have evolved in offering the highest prediction accuracy. In this work, the features of the input image are enhanced with the integration of Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) and a CNN framework without costing more convolution filters. The bottleneck with conventional activation functions, used in CNNs, is the nullification of the feature maps that are negative in value. In this work, a novel Hyper-analytic Wavelet (HW) phase activation function is formulated with unique characteristics for the wavelet sub-bands. Instead of dismissal, the function transforms these negative coefficients that correspond to significant edge feature maps. The hyper-analytic wavelet phase forms the imaginary part of the complex activation. And the hyper-parameter of the activation function is selected such that the corresponding magnitude spectrum produces monotonic and effective activations. The performance of 3 CNN models (1 custom, shallow CNN, ResNet with Soft attention, Alex Net for DR) with spatialCWavelet quilts is better. With the spatialCWavelet quilts, the Alex Net for DR has an improvement with an 11% of accuracy level (from 87 to 98%). The highest accuracy level of 98% and the highest Sensitivity of 99% are attained through Modified Alex Net for DR. The proposal also illustrates the visualization of the negative edge preservation with assumed image patches.

We note that schools opened when the COVID-19 infections and fatalities were heightening in the country, when winter was at its doorsteps and personal protective equipments (PPEs) were inadequately supplied in schools.

He had been found to have an AKI but decided to seek care to the Miami VA instead of being admitted. He denied recent use of NSAIDs or antibiotics and had no changes in medication regimen. He had one self-limited episode of loose stools 2 days prior with no vomiting and had no urinary or neurologic complaints. His physical exam was normal for his age. Labs showed a Cr 4.5 (eGFR 13), a bland urinalysis, mild proteinuria, FeNa 4.1% (in context of chronic HCTZ use) and FeUrea: 52.2%. Further testing showed negative SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis and HIV serologies, ANA(-), SPEP(-), UPEP(-), and normal complement levels. Imaging revealed normal appearance and size of kidneys, no hydronephrosis, and no urolithiasis. Given negative work-up, a kidney biopsy was performed revealing acute tubular injury with increased intratubular oxalate, mild to moderate interstitial fibrosis, moderate to marked arteriosclerosis, FSGS (likely secondary). Upon further questioning he reported consuming a large amount of star fruit the day before developing GI symptoms. He was discharged with close follow up, no renal replacement therapy was needed. Star fruit induced nephrotoxicity is a rare cause of AKI, however it should be suspected in patients with AKI and a recent consumption of large amounts of this fruit. Initial presentation includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and hiccups. After ingestion, circulating free oxalates are filtered through the kidney where they can precipitate into calcium oxalate crystals and cause tubular obstruction. Demonstration of this through biopsy is diagnostic for this type of nephrotoxicity. Many patients need early renal replacement therapy, at least temporarily, but fortunately that wasn't the case in our patient.

In general, heavy inertial particles are centrifuged out of regions of high vorticity and into regions of high strain. In cellular flows, we find, in agreement with earlier results, that droplets with Stokes numbers smaller than a critical value, $St<St_{\\\\rm{cr}}$, remain trapped in the vortices in which they are initialised, while larger droplets move ballistically away from their initial positions by crossing separatrices. We independently vary the P\\\\'eclet number $Pe$ characterising the amplitude of thermal noise and the condensation rate $\\\\Pi$ to study their effects on the critical Stokes number for droplet trapping, as well as on the final states of motion of the droplets.

We find that the effects of thermal noise become negligible for growing droplets, and that growing droplets achieve ballistic motion when their Stokes numbers become $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$.

Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2  10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected.

To address the multidimensional issues from sequelae of COVID-19, evidence from comprehensive surveys beyond clinical perspectives is critical that investigates health, and social determinants of disease progression as well as socioeconomic consequences at a large scale. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this study, we plan to conduct a nationwide and comprehensive survey for the sequelae of COVID-19 in a total of 1000 patients diagnosed at 27 hospitals throughout Japan. This study will evaluate not only the health-related status of patients from clinical perspectives but also the Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) scores, socioeconomic status and consequences to discuss the sequelae of the disease and the related risk factors. The primary endpoint is the frequency of long-term complications of COVID-19 infection. The secondary endpoints are risk factors for progression to sequelae of COVID-19 infection. The study will provide robust and important evidence as a resource to tackle the issues from the sequelae of COVID-19 from the multi-dimensional perspectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Keio University School of Medicine Ethics Committee (20200243, UMIN000042299). The results of this study will be reported at a society meeting or published in a peer-reviewed journal.","output":"Comprehensive and long-term surveys of COVID-19 sequelae in Japan, an ambidirectional multicentre cohort study: study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The development of a rapid, specific, and sensitive SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time quantitative PCR assay is described for the simultaneous detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). The assay specifically detected PEDV and PCV3, with no fluorescence detected for other non-targeted pig pathogens. The assay showed a good linear relationship, and the limits of detection for this assay were 34.6 copies/L and 61.2 copies/L for PEDV and PCV3, respectively. The assay exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, with intra-assay and inter-assay variation coefficients less than 2.0%. A clinical evaluation using intestinal tissue and fecal samples from piglets suffering from diarrhea at different pig farms in China revealed that the singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 43.94% (29/66) and 16.67% (11/66), respectively, while the co-infection rate of PCV3 with PEDV was 27.27% (18/66). The results indicate this assay is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for PEDV and PCV3 monitoring and surveillance in the field, and provides technical support for the quantitative detection of clinical samples infected or co-infected with PEDV and PCV3.","output":"Development of a SYBR green I-based duplex real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine circovirus 3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread.

Currently, several underlying mechanisms involved in viral replication, pathogenesis, and evading host innate immunity of BVDV remain to be elucidated, particularly during the early stage of virus infection. To further explore the mechanisms of BVDV-host interactions, the transcriptomics and proteomics profiles of BVDV-infected MDBK cells were sequenced using RNA-seq and iTRAQ techniques, respectively, and followed by an integrative analysis. Compared with mock-infected MDBK cells, a total of 665 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (391 down-regulated, 274 up-regulated) and 725 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (461 down-regulated, 264 up-regulated) were identified. Among these, several DEGs and DEPs were further verified using quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Following gene ontology (GO) annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis, we determined that these DEGs and DEPs were significantly enriched in multiple important cellular signaling pathways including NOD-like receptor, Toll-like receptor, TNF, NF-B, MAPK, cAMP, lysosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis signaling pathways. Significantly, the down-regulated DEGs and DEPs were predominantly associated with apoptosis-regulated elements, inflammatory factors, and antiviral elements that were involved in innate immunity, thus, indicating that BVDV could inhibit apoptosis and the expression of host antiviral genes to facilitate viral replication. Meanwhile, up-regulated DEGs and DEPs were primarily involved in metabolism and autophagy signaling pathways, indicating that BVDV could utilize the host metabolic resources and cell autophagy to promote replication. However, the potential mechanisms BVDV-host interactions required further experimental validation. Our data provide an overview of changes in transcriptomics and proteomics profiles of BVDV-infected MDBK cells, thus, providing an important basis for further exploring the mechanisms of BVDV-host interactions.","output":"Integrative Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis Provide a Deep Insight Into Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus-Host Interactions During BVDV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified U.S. health disparities.

Methods: We conducted a systemic search using LitCovid and MEDLINE electronic databases. We screened citations, titles and abstracts, then reviewed potentially relevant articles in full. After data extraction, we reported our final data under subheadings of demographics, diagnosis, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, treatment, and patient outcomes. Results: Our search strategy yielded 42 original studies reporting 674 pediatric patients fitting the case definition of MIS-C. The studies included 21 case reports, 16 case series and 5 cohort studies. The most common reported symptom of MIS-C was fever (98%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were common (N=557, 83%). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured in 125 patients and was elevated in 94 % (N=117). Echocardiography detected coronary artery lesions in 100 patients. Prophylactic and/or therapeutic heparin was required in 34% (N=227) of patients. The most commonly administered treatment modality targeting MIS-C was intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (N=490).

Each Indian state has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state governments between 19 May and 1 June, 2020. METHODS: We designed a semi-quantitative framework with 45 indicators to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting. The framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting C availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0C1) for each state. RESULTS: Our results indicate a large disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Ten states do not report data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. Only ten states provide trend graphics for COVID-19 data. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by publicly releasing their personally identifiable information. The CDRS is positively associated with the states sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630,p=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting. The disparity in CDRS highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence.

METHODS Three anonymous REDCap surveys were administered to all medical students at a rural academic institution. Surveys 1 and 2 were administered preceding and after an institution-wide MCI drill, in September and November 2019, respectively. Survey 3 was administered following a student-organized COVID-19 blood drive in June 2020. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if factors, ie, experience with MCI drills and emergency medical services (EMS) training, were associated with willingness to donate blood. Furthermore, barriers to donation among those not willing to donate were assessed.

Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8+ lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8+ cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8+ T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon , chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.","output":"Innate immunity in COVID-19 patients mediated by NKG2A receptors, and potential treatment using Monalizumab, Cholroquine, and antiviral agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing application of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology in the field of meteorology, satellite-derived zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) data have been used to explore the spatial coverage pattern of PM(2.5) concentrations. In this study, the PM(2.5) concentration data obtained from 340 PM(2.5) ground stations in south-central China were used to analyze the variation patterns of PM(2.5) in south-central China at different time periods, and six PM(2.5) interpolation models were developed in the region. The spatial and temporal PM(2.5) variation patterns in central and southern China were analyzed from the perspectives of time series variations and spatial distribution characteristics, and six types of interpolation models were established in central and southern China. (1) Through correlation analysis, and exploratory regression and geographical detector methods, the correlation analysis of PM(2.5)-related variables showed that the GNSS-derived PWV and ZTD were negatively correlated with PM(2.5), and that their significances and contributions to the spatial analysis were good. (2) Three types of suitable variable combinations were selected for modeling through a collinearity diagnosis, and six types of models (geographically weighted regression (GWR), geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), geographically weighted regressionempirical bayesian kriging (GWR-EBK), multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), multiscale geographically weighted regression kriging (MGWRK), and multiscale geographically weighted regressionempirical bayesian kriging (MGWR-EBK)) were constructed. The overall R(2) of the GWR-EBK model construction was the best (annual: 0.962, winter: 0.966, spring: 0.926, summer: 0.873, and autumn: 0.908), and the interpolation accuracy of the GWR-EBK model constructed by inputting ZTD was the best overall, with an average RMSE of 3.22 g/m(3) recorded, while the GWR-EBK model constructed by inputting PWV had the highest interpolation accuracy in winter, with an RMSE of 4.5 g/m(3) recorded; these values were 2.17% and 4.26% higher than the RMSE values of the other two types of models (ZTD and temperature) in winter, respectively. (3) The introduction of the empirical Bayesian kriging method to interpolate the residuals of the models (GWR and MGWR) and to then correct the original interpolation results of the models was the most effective, and the accuracy improvement percentage was better than that of the ordinary kriging method. The average improvement ratios of the GWRK and GWR-EBK models compared with that of the GWR model were 5.04% and 14.74%, respectively, and the average improvement ratios of the MGWRK and MGWR-EBK models compared with that of the MGWR model were 2.79% and 12.66%, respectively.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the correlation between the total numbers of patients and the total amount of HCW generated. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, translated to English, and analyzed with Open Code version 4.02 software, and content analysis was followed. Results: The total mean weight (SD) of waste generation rate in all service units of the hospital was 492.5  11.5 kg/day. The higher proportion (61.9%) of the total HCW produced was general waste and the remaining (38.1%) was hazardous waste. There was a statistically significant (X 2 = 82.1, p < 0.001) difference in daily HCW generation rate among different case teams. Similarly, the hospital waste generation amount and total patient flow had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.7, p=0.032).

We tested the hypothesis that the pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with substance use disorder by evaluating average daily 911 ambulance calls for substance use-related issues compared with all other calls. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 911 ambulance calls before and after the start of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. We used consecutive samples of 911 ambulance calls, categorized into those which were substance-related or not. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine if there were changes in numbers of daily calls before a statewide declaration of emergency for COVID-19 (February 15-March 9, 2020), from the emergency declaration until a stay-at-home advisory (March 10-March 22, 2020) and following the stay-at-home advisory (March 23-May 15, 2020). Results: Compared with prior to the statewide emergency, the post-statewide emergency average of daily ambulance calls decreased from 2,453.2 to 1,969.6, a 19.7% decrease. Similarly, calls for substance-related reasons decreased by 16.4% compared with prior to the statewide emergency. However, despite an initial decrease in calls, after the stay-at-home advisory calls for substance use began increasing by 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-1.1) calls/day, while calls for other reasons did not significantly change (+1.2 (95% CI -0.8 to 3.1) calls/day). Refusal of transport for substance-related calls increased from 5.0% before the statewide emergency to 7.5% after the declaration (p < 0.001). Conclusions: After an initial decline in substance-related ambulance calls following a statewide declaration of emergency, calls for substance use increased to pre-COVID-19 levels while those for other reasons remained at a lower rate.

The effectiveness was assessed in terms of well-being in older adults and on negative stereotypes about the elderly in primary and secondary students. METHODS Three interventions were carried out in which 32 older persons (9 users of centers for older adults and 23 of a day hospital), 99 primary students and 56 secondary students participated. Participants answered a questionnaire before and after the interventions. Through multilevel linear models for repeated measures, changes in feelings of loneliness, social support, anxiety and depressive symptoms, self-reported health and health-related quality of life were evaluated in older people. In primary and secondary students, changes in age stereotypes were evaluated. RESULTS Health-related quality of life and self-reported health improved statistically after the interventions in older persons. Users of the day hospital also reported an improvement in social support. Primary school students improved their age stereotypes; no statistically significant changes were detected in secondary students. CONCLUSION The results of the present study contribute to underlining the importance of intergenerational programs such as the one proposed by CRENCO, capable of improving well-being and providing a more realistic vision of the older adults.

Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccineCrelated keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity.

Although CanSino is currently approved for use in 10 Latin American, Asian, and European countries, little information is available about its vaccine effectiveness (VE). Methods: We evaluated CanSino VE within a childcare worker cohort that included 1,408 childcare facilities. Participants were followed during March-December 2021 and tested through SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or rapid antigen test if they developed any symptom compatible with COVID-19. Vaccination status was obtained through worker registries. VE was calculated as 100% x (1-hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), using an Andersen-Gill model adjusted for age, sex, state, and local viral circulation. Results: The cohort included 43,925 persons who were mostly (96%) female with a median age of 32 years; 37,646 (86%) were vaccinated with CanSino. During March-December 2021, 2,250 (5%) participants had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of whom 25 were hospitalized and 6 died. Adjusted VE was 20% (95% CI = 10-29%) against illness, 76% (42-90%) against hospitalization, and 94% (66-99%) against death. VE against illness declined from 48% (95% CI = 33-61) after 14-60 days following full vaccination to 20% (95% CI = 9-31) after 61-120 days. Conclusions: CanSino vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 illness and highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death. It will be useful to further evaluate duration of protection and assess the value of booster doses to prevent COVID-19 and severe outcomes.","output":"Vaccine effectiveness of CanSino (Adv5-nCoV) COVID-19 vaccine among childcare workers -- Mexico, March-December 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 for short) has caused a large number of deaths around the world We summarized the data reported in the past few months and emphasized that the main causes of death of COVID-19 patients are DAD (Diffuse Alveolar Damage) and DIC (Disseminated intravascular coagulation) Microthrombosis is a prominent clinical feature of COVID-19, and 91 3% of dead patients had microthrombosis","output":"Anatomical and Pathological Observation and Analysis of SARS and COVID-19: Microthrombosis Is the Main Cause of Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an ever changing 21st century world, pandemics such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus also known as COVID-19 have come to stay, especially as the world is gradually becoming a global village.

This 3-year follow-up study assesses late adverse effects, evaluates rehabilitative long-term effects and identifies patients who benefit the most. DESIGN RePCa was a randomized clinical trial with multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 79) or usual care (n = 82). The intervention during the first 6 months consisted of consultations by nurses and physiotherapists focusing on psychosocial support and physical activity, respectively. Here we report the 3-year follow-up. Data consisted of disease-specific quality of life (EPIC-26), general quality of life (SF-12) and pelvic floor strength measured by electromyography. RESULTS One hundred forty-three patients (92%) responded. The primary outcome urinary irritative sum-score was no longer significantly different between groups. In patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline, we observed a significant long-term effect on the urinary irritative sum-score in favour of the intervention (+ 13.4 points P = .014). More patients had moderate-severe bowel problems in the control group (n = 10; 14%) compared to the intervention group (n = 2; 3%) (P = .016). Pelvic floor strength deteriorated significantly in both groups. CONCLUSION The short-term rehabilitation was beneficial but of limited benefit in the long term for all patients. A significant and clinically relevant effect was found in irradiated prostate cancer patients with moderate-severe urinary problems at baseline. In both groups, pelvic floor strength was weakened during follow-up. IMPACT FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Prior research showed patients benefit from early rehabilitation. Identification of patients with moderate-severe urinary problems followed by a focused rehabilitation during the first 6 months after radiotherapy results in long-term improvement. Radiated patients have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Patients can be informed that they benefit from early rehabilitation, and they cannot expect larger changes in adverse effects within the first years, but they have to be aware of their pelvic floor strength.

COVID-19 is a new pandemic with very little information available about its transmission and association with environmental factors. The goal of this paper is to explore the association of environmental factors on daily incidence rate, mortality rate, and recoveries of COVID-19. Methods: The environmental data for humidity, temperature, wind, and sun exposure were recorded from metrological websites and COVID-19 data such as the daily incidence rate, death rate, and daily recovery were extracted from the government's official website available to the general public. The analysis for each outcome was adjusted for factors such as lock down status, nationwide events, and the number of daily tests performed. Analysis was completed with negative binominal regression log link using generalised linear modelling. Results: Daily temperature, sun exposure, wind, and humidity were not significantly associated with daily incidence rate. Temperature and nationwide social gatherings, although non-significant, showed trends towards a higher chance of incidence. An increase in the number of daily testing was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 incidences (effect size ranged from 2.17-9.96). No factors were significantly associated with daily death rates. Except for the province of Balochistan, a lower daily temperature was associated with a significantly higher daily recovery rate.

Immediate-type allergy to PEGs including anaphylaxis is rare. The recent introduction of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has led to an increased focus on PEG as a possible culprit of allergic reactions to the vaccines. A low awareness of the allergenic potential of PEG among consumers, manufacturers and doctors leads to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of allergy to PEGs, putting patients at risk of repeated severe reactions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical manifestations, time to diagnosis and impact of a PEG allergy diagnosis on the daily life of patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG from 2010 to 2019. METHOD: Ten patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG were included. Detailed clinical history was obtained, and allergy investigations had been performed at the time of diagnosis. All patients were contacted and asked to retrospectively complete a questionnaire about causes and impact on daily life of an allergy to PEG, scored on a likert scale (0-10) before and after diagnosis. RESULTS: Eight patients had experienced at least one anaphylactic reaction requiring adrenaline treatment. Anaphylaxis was primarily caused by antibiotic/analgesic tablets, depot-steroids, antacids and laxatives. Seven patients reported repeated reactions before diagnosis (median 3, range 2-6). Median time from first reaction to diagnosis was 20 months (range 2-120). None of the patients experienced severe allergic reactions after the diagnosis. Median likert score of the impact on daily life before diagnosis was 7 compared with 4 after diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The clinical manifestations of PEG allergy are often dramatic. Improved awareness about the clinical presentation and common culprits, clear product labelling and a standardized nomenclature is needed to ensure the timely diagnosis of PEG allergy to prevent repeated anaphylactic reactions with severe impact on patients' lives.","output":"Clinical manifestations and impact on daily life of allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG) in ten patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses (1) the impacts of COVID-19 on food supply and demand in urban centres in Nigeria;(2) the potential of urban agriculture to help tackle the problem of food shortages in urban centers;and (3) the needed policy support to promote urban agriculture in Nigeria","output":"Beyond COVID-19: turning crisis to opportunity in Nigeria through urban agriculture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new and more robust work from home paradigm has been created [ ]of the COVID-19 pandemic, U S unemployment has soared According to the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 2005 and 2015, the number of U S employees who telecommuted increased 115%, to 26 million (Zara Adams, \\"The Future of Remote Work,\\" https://bit ly/2WBWgJl) The federal government has been sanctioning this mode for some years now, with mixed success, mostly due to the requirement of \\"monitoring activity\\" [\\"Workplace Privacy and Employee Monitoring,\\" Privacy Rights Clearing House, March 1993 (revised March 2019) https://bit ly/2ZA9Ka9]","output":"Goal Conflict or Goal Confluence?: Certified Public Accountant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 is common but poorly understood.

A total of 19 participants (6 nurses, 5 nursing managers, 4 medical officers, 2 nutritionists, a family medicine specialist, and a paediatrician) took part in this study. The challenges were summarized into four themes: (I) accessibility to nutrition, (II) accessibility to healthcare services, (II) skills of HCPs, and (IV) challenges of implementing nutrition programs. The inability of the Orang Asli children to access nutritious food was due to poverty, different perceptions of life priorities, and the practice of food taboos among the communities. Inadequate infrastructure and transportation discourage parents from bringing their children to healthcare facilities. The belief in and preference for traditional healing, the practice of semi-nomadic lifestyles, and fear of HCPs and their timid nature were factors that prevented Orang Asli children from accessing healthcare services. HCPs need to equip themselves with cross-cultural communication and interaction skills and adapt their skills to environmental challenges to overcome unexpected encounters in mobile clinics. The non-exposed food items, the risk of food basket sharing with other family members, and community feeding programs coordination were the challenges to be addressed when implementing nutrition programmes for Orang Asli children. The challenges of HCPs are multifactorial and require a multifaceted approach.

Hence, computed tomography angiography of the chest was performed, showing evidence of right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental PE along with bilateral multifocal consolidation. Incidentally, the imaging demonstrated a filling defect within the apex of LV, transcending into further cardiac workup. Initial troponin was elevated at 0.04 ng/mL, and electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm without any acute ST-T wave changes. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the presence of large, sessile, mobile, 1.3 x 2.1 cm LV thrombus but normal LV systolic function, ejection fraction, and no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities.

DiscussionLV thrombosis is a well-known complication of LV dysfunction associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy. While PE is an established phenomenon of COVID- 19 induced hypercoagulability, thrombus formation within the cardiac chamber is rarely reported. As cardiovascular complications such as acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy are substantially reported in COVID-19, through this case report, we highlight the rare presentation of COVID 19 hypercoagulability with LV thrombus in the absence of predisposing cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. Although the mechanism remains unclear, endothelial dysfunction eliciting local myocardial inflammation and blood stasis is a plausible explanation. Early recognition of LV thrombus and treatment with anticoagulation is of paramount importance to reducing stroke risk and systemic embolization. The detection of LV thrombus mandates anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin due to insufficient evidence to support the use of direct oral anticoagulants.","output":"An interesting case of COVID-19 induced hypercoagulability manifesting as pulmonary embolism and apical left ventricular thrombus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed proteinCprotein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-?Cresolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.","output":"Full-length three-dimensional structure of the influenza A virus M1 protein and its organization into a matrix layer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In current practice, gadolinium-based contrast agents have been considered safe when used at clinically recommended doses in patients without severe renal insufficiency.

Distinct patterns within the innate immune response correlated with specific clinical features. Proinflammatory myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) were abundant in four of 17 (235%) subjects who were older and manifested severe inflammation with clinical myocarditis and elevated hepatobiliary enzyme levels. Of the nine subjects with low levels of anti\\\\inflammatory, tolerogenic mDC, six had enlarged cervical lymph nodes at diagnosis. In contrast, the adaptive immune repertoire varied greatly with no discernible patterns or associations with clinical features. Two subjects with aneurysms had numerous circulating CD8(+) T cells.

We conducted two meta-analyses to evaluate the association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : Articles were retrieved until November 10 th , 2020 by searching in seven databases. Data were combined using the general variance-based method. Results: : A total of 27 articles were found (N=44,684 patients, including N=7,803 from 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)). Overall, the use of HCQ was associated with 22% lower mortality risk (pooled risk ratio: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.67 to 0.91;I 2 =80%, random effects). This association was found reversed when pooling only RCTs (16.7% of the overall weight;pooled risk ratio: 1.11, 0.99 to 1.24) or studies in which daily dose >400 mg or total dose >4,400 mg were used (pooled risk ratio: 1.10, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.23 in both cases). Overall, HCQ+AZM (10 studies) was also associated with 28% lower mortality risk, but uncertainty was large (95%CI: 0.48 to 1.08;P=0.11). Use of HCQ was not associated with severe adverse events. Conclusions: : HCQ use was not associated with mortality reduction in COVID-19 patients when 5 RCTs only were evaluated, while a 9% to 33% reduced mortality was observed when observational studies were also included. The association was mainly apparent in studies that used lower doses of HCQ.

Those features included state of crisis, restrictions on in-person social interactions, as well as financial adversity. To address the lack of a comprehensive summary of sleep research across these three distinctive domains, we undertook three parallel systematic reviews based on the following themes: 1) Sleep in times of crises; 2) Sleep and social isolation; and 3) Sleep and economic uncertainty. Using a scoping review framework, we systematically identified and summarized findings from these three separated bodies of works. Potential moderating factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, psychological predisposition, occupation and other personal circumstances are also discussed.

However, the application of swiftly developing technologies has posed many challenges. Greenhouse and field applications are complex and differ in their study design requirements. Selecting a sensor type (e.g., thermography or hyperspectral imaging), sensor platform (e.g., rovers, unmanned aerial vehicles, or satellites), and the problem-specific spatial and temporal scale adds to the challenge as all pathosystems are unique and differ in their interactions and symptoms, or lack thereof. Adding hostCpathogenCenvironment interactions across time and space increases the complexity even further. Large data sets are necessary to enable a deeper understanding of these interactions. Therefore, modern machine learning methods are developed to realize the fast data analysis of such complex data sets. This reduces not only human effort but also enables an objective data perusal. Especially deep learning approaches show a high potential to identify probable cohesive parameters during plant-pathogen-environment interactions. Unfortunately, the performance and reliability of developed methods are often doubted by the potential user. Gaining their trust is thus needed for real field applications. Linking biological causes to machine learning features and a clear communication, even for non-experts of such results, is a crucial task that will bridge the gap between theory and praxis of a newly developed application.

Methods: Ministry of Health of Quebec data related to cancer screening programs and diagnosis during the periods of March 2019 to February 2020 and March 2020 to February 2021 were recently reported (ISBN: 978-2-550-888379-1). We analyzed and compared the data related to Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), colonoscopy, and CRC surgery rates for two comparative 4-month periods (April to July). Results: Status of public health emergency was declared in Quebec on March 16, 2020. All elective procedures were therefore suspended on that date. From April to July 2020, FOBT decreased by 67.26%, colonoscopy procedures by 57.8% and CRC surgery by 29.5% compared to the same period from 2019. Peak of suspension of these activities was reached in April and May 2020. The waiting list for colon endoscopy increased by 210% from April to July 2020 and by 141% from August to October 2020. After the first pandemic wave, from August to October 2020, activities were resumed, colonoscopies were 11.4% less by comparison to the same period in 2019 (57 887 vs 65 326 procedures respectively). Primary CRC surgery procedures done between April and July 2020 were 29.5% less compared to the same period in 2019. For the whole year from March 2020 to February 2021, 21% less CRC resections were done compared to the year March 2019 C February 2020. The waiting list for surgery was reduced by 30% from April to July 2020 most probably because of a lower surgical referral.

Life in the shelter can be stressful, and one type of intervention that improves dogs' experience is human interaction, particularly stays in foster homes. Prior research has demonstrated that fostering can reduce dogs' cortisol and increase their resting activity. Despite these benefits, little is understood about the utilization of foster caregiving in animal shelters, and even less so during a crisis. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus outbreak a worldwide pandemic, and subsequently a nationwide emergency was declared in the United States. Nearly all states issued stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of the virus. During this time, media outlets reported increased interest in the adoption and fostering of shelter pets. This study explores canine foster caregiving at 19 US animal shelters during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In our investigation, we found that shelters' utilization of foster caregiving increased from March to April 2020 but returned to initial pandemic levels by June 2020. Slightly less than two-fifths of foster caregivers were community members with no prior relationship with the shelter, and these caregivers were over four times more likely to adopt their fostered dogs than those with a pre-existing relationship to the shelter. Individuals fostering with the intention to adopt, in fact, adopted their dogs in nearly three-quarters of those instances. With regards to shelters' available resources, we found that very low-resource shelters relied more heavily on individuals with prior relationships to provide foster caregiving while very high-resource shelters more often recruited new community members. We also found that our lowest resourced shelters transferred more dogs out of their facilities while more resourced shelters rehomed dogs directly to adopters. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first in-depth reporting about dog fostering in US animal shelters and, more specifically, foster caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, they provide greater understanding of how monetary and human resources were utilized to affect the care and ultimately, the outcomes of shelter dogs during this time.","output":"Emergency Fostering of Dogs From Animal Shelters During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Shelter Practices, Foster Caregiver Engagement, and Dog Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El mundo vive una pandemia por un Coronavirus, llamado SARS-COV-2, que produce la COVID-19 (acrnimo del ingles coronavirus disease 2019), la cual ha generado un colapso en los sistemas de salud, haciendo que el manejo de otras enfermedades se convierta en un reto.

METHODS: We examined the evidence for a vaccine-driven COVID-19 exit strategy including academic papers, governmental reports and epidemiological data, and discuss the shift from the current pandemic footing to an endemic approach similar to influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. RESULTS: A desired endemic state is characterised by a baseline prevalence of infections with a generally mild disease profile that can be sustainably managed by the healthcare system, together with the resumption of near normalcy in human activities. Such an endemic state is attainable for COVID-19 given the promising data around vaccine efficacy, although uncertainty remains around vaccine immunity escape in emergent variants of concern. Maintenance of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains crucial until high vaccination coverage is attained to avoid runaway outbreaks. It may also be worthwhile to de-escalate measures in phases, before standing down most measures for an endemic state. If a variant that substantially evades immunity emerges, it will need to be managed akin to a new disease threat, with pandemic preparedness and response plans.

COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To potentially and further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training and transfer learning are utilized based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. This is in contrary to existing works on COVID-19 detection where pre-training is performed based on natural images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.","output":"COVID-CAPS: A Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of COVID-19 cases from X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are a population at risk for COVID-19. This study has two independent objectives: (1) to report the impact of COVID-19, as well as psycho-social responses during lockdown, in a sample of older adults in Spain, and (2) to explore through the review of published surveys what extent ageism has increased at the population level. The first objective was to search through an online questionnaire collecting information about self-reported health, lifestyles, psycho-social conditions, and a diversity of concerns. This questionnaire was administered to a volunteer sample of 315 older Spanish men and women (301 COVID-19-free and 14 diagnosed with COVID-19). All individuals reported that they had information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Their self-perception of health was also quite good, most maintaining healthy lifestyles and few reporting unhealthy behaviors. They reported few changes in family and interpersonal relations during lockdown. Those diagnosed with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety, irritation, and fear, in comparison with the COVID-19-free group. Interestingly, instead of being concerned about health, the greatest concern in both groups (COVID-free and those diagnosed with COVID) were politics and the future. Our second objective, to explore ageism during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, was examined across various surveys conducted in several populations by several authors. Results showed an increase in ageism in Spain. Although some new information about health perception, psychosocial responses, and concerns during this unknown stressful situation was obtained, much more research with representative samples is required in order to arrive at more accurate conclusions.","output":"Health, Psycho-Social Factors, and Ageism in Older Adults in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we propose a continuous-time stochastic intensity model, namely, two-phase dynamic contagion process(2P-DCP), for modelling the epidemic contagion of COVID-19 and investigating the lockdown effect based on the dynamic contagion model introduced by Dassios and Zhao (2011). It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","output":"A Two-Phase Dynamic Contagion Model for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and vaccines remain the only effective tools available for ending it.

We sought to develop a superior, simpler pancreaticojejunostomy technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We applied a running barbed suture (V-Loc?; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to perform the pancreaticojejunostomy over a stent placed in the pancreatic duct and a small enterotomy in the jejunum. This technique was attempted in the last 19 of 37 patients presenting to two surgeons (M.A.M. and B.H.E.) for a laparoscopic Whipple procedure. Data were collected on operative time, pancreatic leak events, and related complications. RESULTS We successfully applied the modified technique in all 19 patients. Pancreatic leak occurred in 5% of patients with the modified technique (Grade A=0; Grade B=1; Grade C=0) and 11% with the standard technique (Grade A=1; Grade B=1; Grade C=0). All leaks were managed with external drainage. There were no leak-related complications. Mean operative time was shorter for the modified technique (mean, 367 minutes; range, 260-576 minutes) than the standard technique (mean, 440 minutes; range, 300-665 minutes). CONCLUSIONS The use of a running barbed suture for laparoscopic pancreaticojejunostomy is a safe and efficient technique.

The most widely used method of COVID-19 diagnostics is a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples, typically from nasopharyngeal swabs. The RNA extraction is a major bottleneck in current COVID-19 testing, in terms of turn-around, logistics, component availability and cost, which delays or completely precludes COVID-19 diagnostics in many settings. Efforts to simplify the current methods are important, as increased diagnostic availability and efficiency is expected to benefit patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods to circumvent RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-qPCR directly on heat-inactivated subject samples as well as samples lysed with readily available detergents. Our data, including cross-comparisons with clinically diagnosed patient samples, suggest that direct RT-qPCR is a viable option to extraction-based COVID-19 diagnostics. We argue that significant savings in terms of time and cost can be achieved by embracing RNA-extraction-free protocols, that feeds directly into the established PCR-based testing pipeline. This could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing.","output":"Massive and rapid COVID-19 testing is feasible by extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moving block railway systems are the next generation signalling systems currently under development as part of the Shift2Rail European initiative, including autonomous driving technologies.

The authors hypothesized that the Covid-19 pandemic would create a gender gap in perceived work productivity and job satisfaction. This is because when couples are working from home the whole day and when schools are closed, women are expected to devote more time to housework and childcare.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a sample of employed women and men from dual-career families who were working from home since Covid-19 lockdowns started. In total, 286 US-resident full-time employees participated in this study. Participants were asked to report their work productivity and job satisfaction before and since Covid-19 lockdowns.FindingsIt is found that before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were no gender differences in self-rated work productivity and job satisfaction. However, during the lockdown, women reported lower work productivity and job satisfaction than men.Research limitations/implicationsParticipants retrospectively reported their work productivity and job satisfaction before Covid-19. However, there are unlikely to be systematic gender differences in retrospective reports of these measures. Further, the authors only sampled opposite-sex dual career parents. Future research needs to examine the effects of lockdowns on women and men in other types of households.Practical implicationsGiven the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, many regions might experience multiple periods of lockdown, and many workplaces have already adopted or are likely to adopt long-term work-from-home policies. The findings indicate that these long-term changes in the workplace might have long-term negative effects on womens perceived productivity and job-satisfaction in dual-career families.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that society needs provide additional support to women working from home and taking care of children or other dependents, particularly during lockdowns or during times when schools and daycare centers are closed.Originality/valueThe current research is one of the first to claim that despite the greater amount of time that women spend in housework and childcare than men, during normal times, they are as productive and as satisfied with their job as men. However, the Covid-19 pandemic increased womens housework and childcare beyond a threshold, thereby creating a gender gap in work productivity and job satisfaction.","output":"Covid-19 created a gender gap in perceived work productivity and job satisfaction: implications for dual-career parents working from home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare the utilization rate and usage patterns of pseudophakic and phakic donor corneas recovered by the Singapore Eye Bank. METHODS: Records of local donor corneas recovered by the Singapore Eye Bank from 2012 to 2017 were examined. Corneas that were deemed suitable for clinical use were stratified into phakic and pseudophakic groups. We examined the basic demographic pattern of both groups and the initial type of surgery/ies that the corneas were suitable for based on tissue parameters such as time from harvesting, stromal clarity, the clear central corneal area, the presence of Descemets membrane tears or defects, and endothelial cell density and quality. We also identified the types of corneal grafts that the corneas were eventually used for; Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK), Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (ALK), Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK). Finally, the overall utilization rates for each group were determined. RESULTS: A total of 986 corneas deemed suitable for transplant were analyzed, 908 (92%) were phakic and 78 were pseudophakic (8%). The average age of pseudophakic donor corneas was (65  8 yrs. old) and there was a slight male preponderance for both groups (55%). Age adjusted analysis of pseudophakic corneas showed the endothelial cell density (ECD) (mean: 2327  47.1 cells/mm(2)) and clear area (mean: 7.0  0.7 mm) were lesser than phakic corneas. The percentage of pseudophakic corneas that were of EK standard (ECD >2500 cells/mm(2)) were lower compared to phakic corneas (37% and 77% respectively, p < 0.001). There was significant correlation between previous cataract surgery and the endothelial cell count of the donor corneas (p < 0.001), and regression analysis also showed a strong association of ECD with cataract surgery in reference to non-cataract surgery (-478.8 (95% CI-576.9 to -380.7). The overall utilization rate for pseudophakic corneas was 58% compared to that of phakic corneas at 83%. The most common reason for pseudophakic corneas not to be utilized was due to the presence of Descemets membrane (DM) tears or defects under the main or side port incision created during phacoemulsification (30%). Phakic corneas were used primarily for optical grafts 84% (mainly EK) while pseudophakic corneas were used mostly for therapeutic/tectonic grafts 47% (mainly ALK or patch grafts). CONCLUSION: Compared to phakic donor corneas, pseudophakic corneas generally have lower overall tissue quality leading to lower uptake by surgeons and lower utilization rates. Eye banks must continuously refine their donor acceptance criteria and engage surgeons to optimize utilization of each recovered tissue.","output":"Utilization rate and usage patterns of phakic and pseudophakic donor corneas recovered by the Singapore Eye Bank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundWidespread use of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests has been proposed as an important public health intervention to interrupt chains of transmission. Antigen tests may be preferred over PCR because they provide on-demand results for relatively low cost and can identify people when they are most likely to be infectious, particularly when used daily. Yet the extent to which a frequent antigen testing intervention will result in a positive public health impact for COVID-19 will depend on high acceptability and high adherence to such regimens. MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods study assessing acceptability of and adherence to a daily at-home mobile-app connected rapid antigen testing regimen among employees of a US-based media company. Acceptability was assessed across seven domains of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. ResultsAmong 31 study participants, acceptability of the daily testing intervention was generally high, with participants reporting high perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, and self-efficacy; positive affective attitude; acceptable degree of burden and opportunity cost; and assessing the intervention as ethical. 71% reported a preference to test daily using an at-home antigen test than weekly employment-based PCR. Mean adherence to the 21-day testing regimen was 88% with 43% of participants achieving 100% adherence, 48% testing at least every other day, and 10% testing less than every other day. ConclusionsDespite overall high acceptability and adherence, we identified three implementation challenges that must be addressed for frequent serial testing for COVID-19 to be implemented at scale and have a positive public health impact. First, users need guidance on how and when to adapt testing frequencies to different epidemiological conditions. Second, users and institutions need guidelines for how to safely store and share test results. Third, implementation of serial testing strategies must prioritize health equity and protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19.","output":"A Mixed Methods Study Evaluating Acceptability of a Daily COVID-19 Testing Regimen with a Mobile-App Connected, At-Home, Rapid Antigen Test: Implications for Current and Future Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Historically, immigration has been a significant population driver in Canada. In October 2020, immigration targets were raised to an unprecedented level to support economic recovery in response to COVID-19. In addition to the economic impact on Canada, the pandemic has created extraordinary challenges for the health sector and heightened the demand for healthcare professionals. It is therefore imperative to accelerate commensurate employment of internationally educated nurses (IENs) to strengthen and sustain the health workforce and provide care for an increasingly diverse population. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a project to help job-ready IENs in Ontario, Canada, overcome the hurdle of employment by matching them with healthcare employers that had available nursing positions. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used. Interviews were held with IENs seeking employment in the health sector. Secondary analysis was conducted of a job bank database between September 1 and November 30, 2019 to identify healthcare employers with the highest number of postings. Data obtained from the 2016 Canadian Census were used to create demographic profiles mapping the number and proportion of immigrants living in the communities served by these employers. The project team met with senior executives responsible for hiring and managing nurses for these employers. The executives were given the appropriate community immigrant demographic profile, a manual of strategic practices for hiring and integrating IENs, and the rsums and bios of IENs whose skills and experience matched the jobs posted. RESULTS: In total, 112 IENs were assessed for eligibility and 95 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one healthcare employers were identified, and the project team met with 54 senior executives representing these employers. Ninety-five IENs were subsequently matched with an employer. CONCLUSIONS: The project was successful in matching job-ready IENs with healthcare employers and increasing employer awareness of IENs' abilities and competencies, changing demographics, and the benefits of workforce diversity. The targeted activities implemented to support the project goal are applicable to sectors beyond healthcare.

An online survey comprised of 49 closed and open-ended questions was distributed by the Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy to 2,778 NMT affiliates worldwide. The survey sought information on demographics, telehealth perceptions, technology, assessment, clinical practice, safety, and caregiver involvement. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. Eighty-one participants answered the survey and the 69 who completed the survey in its entirety were included in the analysis. Results indicated that the frequency of NMT technique usage had no impact on the overall number of clinical hours retained over telehealth. Correlation analysis revealed an association between more frequent NMT usage and perceived likelihood of using telehealth in the future (i.e., once COVID-19 is no longer a major threat), as well as with fewer group sessions lost over telehealth. All NMT domains transferred to telehealth, although within the sensorimotor domain, fewer therapists implemented rhythmic auditory stimulation for telehealth sessions compared to in-person. Overall, NMTs had fewer hours for telehealth compared to in-person regardless of employment setting. Technological challenges were notable drawbacks, while major benefits included the ability to continue providing NMT when in-person sessions were not possible, increased accessibility for remote clients, and positive outcomes related to increased caregiver involvement.

METHOD: Prospective study of patients presenting with a hip fracture between 23/03/2020 and 18/05/2020. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and COVID-19 status. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, discharge destination and readmission. RESULTS: 50 patients identified, mean age 82. 49 patients underwent operation, 34 (69.4%) within 48 hours of admission. 14 Patients (28%) tested positive for COVID-19 within 30 days. 30-day mortality was 10% (n = 5). 2 patients who died were COVID-19 positive.

The study aims to solve this problem by developing an adaptable method for assessing the vulnerability of organisations that produce, process and sell agricultural products in regional food markets. For this purpose, we applied hierarchical mechanisms of integrated assessment for combining various indicators of agricultural enterprises into a single vulnerability score. The present research examines the alcohol market: while this particular sector is represented by a small number of producers, these organisations are usually the largest taxpayers in the agri-food industry, especially in areas of risky farming. As an example, we show how the vulnerability of Permalko JSC (a large producer of alcoholic beverages) has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This company not only satisfies the needs of Perm oblast's market, but also exports its production to many Russian regions, as well as to near and far abroad. As a result, we propose a new methodology, represented by a set of mathematical formulas, and define its variables.

However, its pathogenesis remains largely unclarified. Corin, a cardiac serine protease, is responsible for converting proANP and proBNP to biologically active peptides. Although the involvement of corin in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure was extensively studied, the alterations in corin and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6), a key enzyme in the conversion of procorin to corin, has not been studied simultaneously in the cardiac and renal tissues in cardiorenal syndrome. Thus, this study aims to examine the status of PCSK6/corin in the cardiac and renal tissues of rats with CHF induced by the creation of aorto-caval fistula (ACF). We divided rats with ACF into two subgroups based on the pattern of their urinary sodium excretion, namely, compensated and decompensated. Placement of ACF led to cardiac hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion, and renal dysfunction, which were more profound in the decompensated subgroup. Corin immunoreactive peptides were detected in all heart chambers at the myocyte membranal and cytosolic localization and in the renal tissue, especially in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule, mTAL, and the collecting duct. Interestingly, the expression and abundance of corin in both the cardiac ventricles and renal tissues were significantly increased in compensated animals as compared with the decompensated state. Noteworthy, the abundance of PCSK6 in these tissues followed a similar pattern as corin. In contrast, furin expression was upregulated in the cardiac and renal tissues in correlation with CHF severity. We hypothesize that the obtained upregulation of cardiac and renal PCSK6/corin in rats with compensated CHF may represent a compensatory response aiming at maintaining normal Na(+) balance, whereas the decline in these two enzymes may contribute to the pathogenesis of avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy, and blunted atrial natriuretic peptide/brain natriuretic peptide actions in decompensated CHF.","output":"Distribution of Cardiac and Renal Corin and Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin-6 in the Experimental Model of Cardio-Renal Syndrome of Various Severities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination has proven effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as death and hospitalisation following COVID-19 illness. However, little is known about the effect of vaccination on other acute and post-acute outcomes of COVID-19. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients mostly in the USA). Using a retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we compared the incidences of COVID-19 outcomes between individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine (approved for use in the USA) at least 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 infection and propensity score-matched individuals unvaccinated for COVID-19 but who had received an influenza vaccine. Outcomes were ICD-10 codes representing documented COVID-19 sequelae in the 6 months after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (recorded between January 1 and August 31, 2021, i.e. before the emergence of the Omicron variant). Associations with the number of vaccine doses (1 vs. 2) and age (< 60 vs.  60 years-old) were assessed. Among 10,024 vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 9479 were matched to unvaccinated controls. Receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose was associated with a significantly lower risk of respiratory failure, ICU admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, and hair loss (each as composite endpoints with death to account for competing risks; HR 0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p<.05), but not other outcomes, including long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Receiving 2 vaccine doses was associated with lower risks for most outcomes. Associations between prior vaccination and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection were marked in those < 60 years-old, whereas no robust associations were observed in those  60 years-old. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with lower risk of several, but not all, COVID-19 sequelae in those with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings may inform service planning, contribute to forecasting public health impacts of vaccination programmes, and highlight the need to identify additional interventions for COVID-19 sequelae.","output":"Six-month sequelae of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study of 10,024 breakthrough infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of the coronavirus pandemic necessitates the need of effective administrative decisions.

Methods: : A total of 156 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia at the central Hospital of Wuhan from January 29, 2020, to March 20, 2020 were enrolled in this single-centered retrospective study. Their epidemiological parameters, clinical presentations, underlying diseases, laboratory test results and disease outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: : The median age of enrolled patients was 66. Underlying diseases were identified in 101 patients, with hypertension being the most common one, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most common symptoms identified upon admission were fever, cough, dyspnea and fatigue. Compared to survival cases, patients who dead during hospitalization had higher plasma levels of D-dimer, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate and lower percentage of lymphocytes (LYM [%]), platelet count and albumin levels. Most enrolled patients received anti-biotics and anti-viral treatment. In addition, 60 patients received corticosteroid and 51 received intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. 44 patients received noninvasive ventilation, 19 received invasive ventilation. Respiratory failure was the most frequently observed complication (106 [67.9%]), followed by sepsis (103 [66.0%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (67 [42.9%]) and septic shock (50 [32.1%]). Multivariable regression suggested that advanced age (OR [odds ratio]= 1.059, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.011-1.110, P = 0.016) and elevated lactate level upon admission (OR= 2.411, 95% CI: 1.177-4.941, P = 0.016) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 infection.

The present study sought to examine potential associations between changes to sleep and eating habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Questions for diet asked, since quarantine: Im eating healthier, eating more processed foods, home-cooked meals and more regularly, Im enjoying food in quarantine and Im struggling with overeating in quarantine. Sleep questions asked since quarantine: I have managed to keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, my sleep has improved, Im struggling to fall asleep, Im waking up more during the night, Im more sleepy during the day and Im taking more naps during the day. Answers were reported on a 4-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Ordinal logistic regressions were used, adjusted for age and sex and examined each dietary variable as ordinal outcome and each sleep variable as predictor. RESULTS: Those who report that they kept a more regular schedule were more likely to report eating healthier (oOR=3.13, p=0.007), eating more home-cooked meals (oOR=3.19, p=0.005), and less likely to be eating more processed foods (oOR=0.39, p=0.02), struggle with overeating (oOR=0.39, p=0.02) or undereating (oOR=0.30, p=0.004) or snacking (oOR=0.25, p=0.001). Those reporting more difficulty falling asleep were less likely to be eating healthier (oOR=0.25, p=0.002) and more likely to be eating more processed foods (oOR=3.07, p=0.009) and snacking (oOr=2.36, P=0.04). Those reporting more difficulty with awakenings were less likely to report eating healthier (oOR=0.34, p=0.03) and more likely to report eating more processed foods (oOR=4.52, p=0.001). Those with more sleepiness were less likely to report eating healthier (oOR=0.29, p=0.01) and more homecooked meals (oOR=0.40, p=0.046) and more likely to report eating more processed foods (oOR=6.42, p<0.0005), overeating (oOR=3.63, p=0.01) and snacking (oOR=5.81, p=0.001).

In individuals with high-level SCI, abnormal sympathovagal balance (such as during autonomic dysreflexia; paroxysmal hypertension provoked by sensory stimuli below the injury) is proarrhythmogenic. Exercise training is a key component of SCI rehabilitation and management of cardiovascular disease risk, but it is unclear whether exercise training influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether susceptibility to arrhythmia increases in a rodent-model of SCI; (ii) the impact of the sympathomimetic drug dobutamine (DOB) on arrhythmia risk; (iii) whether exercise training ameliorates arrhythmia risk. Twenty-one Wistar rats were divided into 3 subgroups: T2-contusive SCI (T2, n = 7), T2-contusive SCI completing passive hindlimb cycling training (PHLC, n = 7), and T10-contusive SCI (T10, n = 7). Known electrocardiographic arrhythmia markers and heart rate variability parameters were evaluated before (PRE), 1-week (POST) and 5-weeks post-SCI (TERM) at baseline and during DOB infusion (30 g/kg/min).

DOB decreased R-R interval (p < 0.001), and increased markers of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, particularly in high-level (T2) animals (p < 0.05). Exercise training blunted the exacerbation of markers of arrhythmia risk in the presence of DOB. Markers of risk for cardiac arrhythmia are increased in experimental SCI, and DOB further increases arrhythmia risk in high-level SCI.

Methods: We administered a 48-items online survey (published on April 11, 2020) including socio-demographic, epilepsy-related, and psychometric variables (BDI-II for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, and PSQI for sleep) to PwE and people without epilepsy (PwoE). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. Results: We collected responses from 456 PwE (344 females) and 472 PwoE (347 females). Outpatient examinations of PwE were postponed in 95% of cases. One-third of PwE complained of issues with epilepsy management, but only 71% of them reached the treating physician and solved their problems. PwE had worse depressive and anxiety symptoms (higher BDI-II and GAD-7 scores; p < 0.001) than PwoE. Sleep quality was equally compromised in both groups (47 and 42%). Sixty-seven PwE (18%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by the number of anti-seizure medications (ASM) of chronic therapy and the severity of sleep disorder. Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced difficulties in follow-up and a seizure number increase, in particular those chronically taking more ASMs and with poor sleep quality.

The virus remains in the gut weeks to months after respiratory infection, causing zonulin release from the intestinal epithelial cells. Zonulin loosens tight junctions, permitting trafficking of highly inflammatory viral particles into circulation. Current MIS-C treatments target the subsequent immune hyperactivation, not the causative loss of mucosal barrier integrity. Larazotide, a zonulin inhibitor, prevents breakdown of tight junctions, limiting antigen trafficking. DESIGN: Children with MIS-C were treated with larazotide as an adjuvant to steroid/intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Clinical outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia, and cytokine profiles are reported. Outcomes were compared with children with MIS-C receiving steroids and/or IVIG therapy alone. PATIENTS: Four children with MIS-C, ages 3C17 years, were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with open label larazotide 10 mcg/kg (maximum 500 mcg/dose) orally four times daily for 21 days.

While the Delta wave appears to have peaked nationally, some states and municipalities continue to see elevated numbers of new cases. Vigilant surveillance including at a metropolitan level can help identify any reignition and validate continued and strong public health policy responses in problem localities. OBJECTIVE: This surveillance report aimed to provide up-to-date information for the 25 largest US metropolitan areas about the rapidity of descent in the number of new cases following the Delta wave peak, as well as any potential reignition of the pandemic associated with declining vaccine effectiveness over time, new variants, or other factors. METHODS: COVID-19 pandemic dynamics for the 25 largest US metropolitan areas were analyzed through September 19, 2021, using novel metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence, calculated from the observed data on the cumulative number of cases as reported by USAFacts. Statistical analysis was conducted using dynamic panel data models estimated with the Arellano-Bond regression techniques. The results are presented in tabular and graphic forms for visual interpretation. RESULTS: On average, speed in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas declined from 34 new cases per day per 100,000 population, during the week ending August 15, 2021, to 29 new cases per day per 100,000 population, during the week ending September 19, 2021. This average masks important differences across metropolitan areas. For example, Miamis speed decreased from 105 for the week ending August 15, 2021, to 40 for the week ending September 19, 2021. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Riverside, and San Diego had decreasing speed over the sample period and ended with single-digit speeds for the week ending September 19, 2021.

Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (?) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ? values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","output":"No Place Like Home: Cross-National Data Analysis of the Efficacy of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, images of a potential new banknote that may be introduced in Argentina have circulated, which depict Ramn Carrillo (the country's first Minister of Public Health) and Cecilia Grierson (the country's first female physician).

We compared the actual number and rate of completed, canceled, and no-show visits between an 8-week period in 2019, when we exclusively conducted visits in person and the same 8-week period in 2020, during the COVID-19 quarantine, when we exclusively conducted visits via telehealth. METHODS: We used electronic health record data for all patients, as well as Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring data collected for a subset of youths during the COVID-19 quarantine and the immediate pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Although there was a difference in the absolute number of in-person versus telehealth visits canceled during these two time periods, there was no difference in the rates of completed, canceled, and no-show visits completed in person or via telehealth. This finding suggests that, despite a rapid shift to a completely new health care delivery model, our providers completed a similar rate of patient care via telehealth during the COVID-19 quarantine and that telehealth may be a feasible method for providing diabetes care. However, our results also suggested that youths' glucose management was less optimal during the quarantine period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presented an opportunity to adopt and test the feasibility of using a telehealth delivery model for routine diabetes care. Yet, to make telehealth a viable treatment delivery alternative will likely involve the uptake of new clinic procedures, investment in institutional infrastructure, and team-based flexibility.","output":"Feasibility of implementing a pediatric diabetes clinic via telehealth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 crisis has translated into an unprecedented humanitarian crisis for the poor and marginalized groups in society. The countrywide lockdowns, quarantine measures, and mobility restrictions across 200 countries of the world have resulted in a host of negative manifestations for women. There have been unprecedented losses in the informal economy, which is dominated by women. Some scholars also contend that the pandemic will translate into heightened burden of unpaid domestic work, loss of economic autonomy and disruption to maternal health services. Despite these factors a gendered perspective is absent in the policy response to this crisis. It is against this background that the present paper employed a feminist intersectionality lens to conduct participatory field based research on the lived experiences of women in informal employment in Indian Punjab during the COVID\\\\19 crisis. The research unearthed the specific pathways through which existing socio\\\\economic inequities rooted in caste, class and occupational entities magnify the vulnerabilities experienced by women during such a health crisis. The research offers a contextualized framework for understanding the gendered impacts of the crisis. It also highlights the urgency of taking account of gender specific constraints during the health crisis so as to institute robust, effective and equitable policy interventions.","output":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic: Narratives of informal women workers in Indian Punjab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Breastfeeding provides passive immunity while the neonatal immune system matures, and may also protect against chronic immune-mediated conditions long after weaning. This review summarizes current knowledge and new discoveries about human milk and mucosal immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: New data suggest that certain microbes in maternal milk may seed and shape the infant gut microbiota, which play a key role in regulating gut barrier integrity and training the developing immune system. Human milk oligosaccharides, best known for their prebiotic functions, have now been shown to directly modulate gene expression in mast and goblet cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Epidemiologic data show a reduced risk of peanut sensitization among infants breastfed by peanut-consuming mothers, suggesting a role for milk-borne food antigens in tolerance development. Cross-fostering experiments in mice suggest the soluble Toll-like receptor 2, found in human milk, may be critical in this process. Finally, interest in human milk antibodies surged during the pandemic with the identification of neutralizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibodies in maternal milk following both natural infection and vaccination. SUMMARY: Human milk provides critical immune protection and stimulation to breastfed infants. Understanding the underlying mechanisms could identify new therapeutic targets and strategies for disease prevention across the lifespan.","output":"Breastfeeding and the developmental origins of mucosal immunity: how human milk shapes the innate and adaptive mucosal immune systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Neonatal sepsis is the gravest problem in neonates, ending in significant morbidity and mortality. World wide 6.9 million neonates were spotted with potentially severe bacterial infections needing treatment and 2.6 million of them occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Sepsis is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and is perhaps answerable for about 30C50% of the total neonatal deaths per year in emerging countries. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the treatment outcome and associated factors of neonatal sepsis at Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital, South West Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective observational study was done at Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) from May to November 2019 among neonates admitted with sepsis. Data were entered to Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 21. Bivariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to identify the relationship between dependent and independent variables. All neonates 28 days who were admitted to MTUTH at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and neonates diagnosed with sepsis by the attending physician either clinically or laboratory-confirmed included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 211 neonatal sepsis patients, 110 (52.1%) were females, 161 (76.3%) were admitted with late-onset sepsis, 16 (7.6%) were very low birth weight, and 156 (73.9%) were term. About 143 (67.8%) had a good outcome and 68 (32.2%) had a poor outcome. Very low birth weight [P = 0.006, AHR = 1.692, 95% CI: (1.245, 4.36)], age of neonate being less than 4 days at admission [P = 0.001, AHR = 9.67, 95% CI: (2.24, 41.70)], maternal infection [P = 0.032, AHR = 3.186, 95% CI: (1.32, 30.68)], and prolonged length of hospital stay [(P = 0.017, AHR = 12.29, 95% CI: (1.55, 96.31), were significantly associated to mortality. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of neonatal sepsis was found to be high.

While this market is growing, sales still occur through unregulated channels. This systematic review identifies factors influencing cannabis purchasing to help policymakers understand why consumers still purchase illicit market cannabis (registered with PROSPERO CRD42020176079). METHODS A comprehensive search strategy included databases in health, business, and social science fields (inception to June 2020). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were conducted with persons who purchase cannabis and examine at least one attribute that would influence purchase choice and were published in the English language. Studies could be of any methodological design. Two independent reviewers completed two levels of screening, and all extraction was verified by a second reviewer. A qualitative synthesis of the findings was completed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS Of the 4839 citations screened, 96 were eligible for full-text review and 35 were included in the final synthesis. Aspects of price were the most common factors (27 studies). Twenty studies measured price elasticity; most studies found that demand was price inelastic. Many other attributes were identified (e.g., product quality, route of administration, product recommendations, packaging), but none were explored in depth. Eleven studies addressed aspects of product quality including demand elasticity based on quality, potency, and aroma. Studies also explored consumer-perceived \\"quality\\" but provided no definition; differences in quality appeared to impact consumer choice. Smoking cannabis appeared to be the preferred route of administration but was only examined in three studies. There was insufficient data to understand in the impact of other attributes on choice. There appeared to be preference heterogeneity for different attributes based on the consumer's experience, reason for use, and gender. CONCLUSION While price influences choices, demand is relatively inelastic. This suggests that consumers may be seeking lowest-cost, unregulated cannabis to avoid reducing consumption. Beyond price, there is a significant gap in our understanding of consumer choices. Perceived quality does appear to impact choice; however, more research is needed due to the lack of a recognized definition for cannabis quality.","output":"Characteristics that influence purchase choice for cannabis products: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection leads to multifactorial acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with little therapeutic success.

Reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Due to technical limitations, the reported positive rates of qRT-PCR assay of throat swab samples vary from 30 to 60%. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative strategies to overcome the limitations of qRT-PCR is required. A previous study reported that one-step nested (OSN)-qRT-PCR revealed better suitability for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, information on the analytical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR is insufficient. METHOD: In this study, we aimed to analyze OSN-qRT-PCR by comparing it with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qRT-PCR by using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral RNA and a quality assessment panel. The clinical performance of OSN-qRT-PCR was also validated and compared with ddPCR and qRT-PCR using specimens from COVID-19 patients. RESULT: The limit of detection (copies/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI: 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28/34), 67.65% (23/34), and 58.82% (20/34), respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","output":"Analysis and validation of a highly sensitive one-step nested quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for specific detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of novel fibrous biomaterials and further processing of medical devices is still challenging.

The aim of the study was to characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with a focus on CVD. Methods: Using the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. We compared them with changes in ACE-2 networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing public data of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This analysis was performed using the Network by Relative Importance (NERI) algorithm, which integrates protein-protein interaction with co-expression networks. We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which miRNAs regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. Finally, we performed enrichment analysis for identifying the main COVID-19 risk groups. Results: We found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signaling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. The most affected genes were EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), FN1 (Fibronectin 1), TP53, HSP90AA1, and APP (Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein), while the most affected interactions were associated with MAST2 and CALM1 (Calmodulin 1). Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimers disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. Among affected ACE2-network components connected with the SARS-Cov-2 interactome, we identified AGT (Angiotensinogen), CAT (Catalase), DPP4 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4), CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2), TFRC (Transferrin Receptor) and CAV1 (Caveolin-1), associated with cardiovascular risk factors. We described for the first time miRNAs which were common regulators of ACE2 networks and virus-related proteins in all analyzed datasets. The top miRNAs regulating ACE2 networks were miR-27a-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-302c-5p, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-1305, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-miR-16-5p. Conclusion: Our study provides a complete mechanistic framework for investigating the ACE2 network which was validated by expression data. This framework predicted risk groups, including the established ones, thus providing reliable novel information regarding the complexity of signaling pathways affected by SARS-CoV-2. It also identified miRNAs that could be used in personalized diagnosis in COVID-19.","output":"ACE2 Interaction Networks in COVID-19: A Physiological Framework for Prediction of Outcome in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionHealthcare workers are experiencing deterioration in their mental health due to COVID-19. Ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with a higher death rate and poorer physical and mental health outcomes. It is important that healthcare organisations consider the specific context and mental, as well as physical, health needs of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce in order to better support them during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we conducted focus group discussions with healthcare workers between December 2020 and July 2021, and covered topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, and perceptions about safety and protection, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary health workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. FindingsWe carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 participants. Several factors were identified which contributed to, and potentially exacerbated, the poor mental health of ethnic minority healthcare workers during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy); fear (of infection); trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death); guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones); and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). ConclusionCOVID-19 has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health across diverse ethnic groups. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors. This paper will help employers of healthcare workers and other relevant policy makers better understand the wider implications and potential risks of COVID-19 and assist in developing strategies to safeguard the mental health of these healthcare workers going forward, and reduce ethnic disparities.

The oral alterations observed in the patients were grouped into Group 1 (pre-existing conditions and opportunistic oral lesions) and Group 2 (oral mucosal changes related to hospitalization). RESULTS: Oral lesions found in the patients of Group 1 are not suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection as they are mainly caused by opportunistic infections. On the other hand, oral alterations found in the patients of Group 2 were statistically (P < 0.001) related to intubation and longer period of hospitalisation.

We therefore studied behavior, and the expression of specific genes and neurochemicals modulating crucial neural processes in offspring of rats exposed to prophylactic dose of Chq during different stages of gestation.

Behavioral characterization of offspring between postnatal days 15-20 in the open field, Y-maze, elevated plus and elevated zero mazes revealed that Chq evoked anxiogenic responses and perturbed spatial memory in rats, although locomotor activity was generally unaltered. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and cerebellum of rats prenatally exposed to Chq, RT-qPCR analysis revealed decreased mRNA expression of presynaptic marker synaptophysin, which was accompanied by downregulation of postsynaptic marker PSD95. Synaptic marker PICK1 expression was also downregulated in the hippocampus but was unperturbed in the PFC and cerebellum. In addition to recorded SOD downregulation in cortical and hippocampal lysates, induction of oxidative stress in rats prenatally exposed to Chq was corroborated by lipid peroxidation as evinced by increased MDA levels. Offspring of rats infused with Chq at mid-gestation and weekly treatment throughout gestation were particularly susceptible to neurotoxic changes, especially in the hippocampus.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality demonstrate a striking age dependence with low values for those aged < 50 years, but rapidly growing rates for those  50 years. Age dependence was particularly pronounced for infection criticality rate and infection fatality rate. With Qatars young population, overall SARS-CoV-2 severity and fatality were not high with < 4 infections in every 1000 being severe or critical and < 2 in every 10,000 being fatal. Only 13 infections in every 1000 received any hospitalization in acute-care-unit beds and < 2 in every 1000 were hospitalized in intensive-care-unit beds. However, we show that these rates would have been much higher if Qatars population had the demographic structure of Europe or the United States.

Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19EAVE IIdatabase comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 54 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices. Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis. A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1Cadjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 650 years (SD 162). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85C94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28C34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75C94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72C89 at 28C34 days post-vaccination). INTERPRETATION: Mass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland. There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.

The physical and psychological impact of working during lockdown is unknown, and staff stress could have negative implications for racehorse welfare. Over half of staff surveyed were still working during lockdown. Racing grooms and stud staff were more likely to be working than most sectors, due to the timing of lockdown with the racing calendar and foaling season. Administrative staff were busier during lockdown, completing additional risk assessments or paperwork. Most staff reported that workplace changes were successful in protecting health and safety, but flat racing grooms felt that work-based changes were less effective. Negative perceptions of work-based COVID-19 changes may affect the staffs ability to complete daily tasks and thus influence the quality of care provided to horses in their charge. Trainers and part-time staff were concerned about job security, highlighting a need for further employee support structures following the pandemic. The racing industry has prioritised staff health and safety but continued reflection on staff well-being, demands and working practices will maximise staffs ability to care for horses under their charge, and allow racing to maintain the highest standards of equine welfare. ABSTRACT: Due to COVID-19, horseracing was required to cease all activity in March 2020; however, little is known about the pandemics impact on staff working practices. This study investigated the impact of COVID-19 on staff working practices during the initial lockdown phases. An online survey about working conditions during lockdown was answered by 287 participants. Chi-squared tests for independence and binary logistic regression (BLR) analysis was undertaken. A total of 53.7% (n = 154) of staff were working during lockdown. Pandemic-specific workplace changes were reported as effective by 87.8% (n = 115) of staff. Flat grooms reported workplace changes as less effective ((2) (52, n = 131) = 92.996, p < 0.001). A total of 67.2% (n = 193) of staff were positive about job security. Trainers and grooms were significantly less likely to report jobs as secure ((2) (52, n = 287) = 75.653, p < 0.05). The findings suggest that most of the racing industry positively received changes made by their employers to tackle the pandemic, and for staff still working during lockdown, their health and safety was prioritised. Continued development of employee support structures to promote job security and workforce stability is advised, which will minimise the disruption of staff changes on the care and welfare of the horses.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Staff Working Practices in UK Horseracing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful tool to diagnose infectious diseases.

The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) implemented a multi-pronged surveillance and containment strategy to reduce the risk of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within the local military camps. This paper details the epidemiological investigations of the COVID-19 cases in the SAF and highlights the strategies and public health measures undertaken, aligned with the national COVID-19 control strategy, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the military camps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical data of our military personnel who were infected with COVID-19 during the first 180 days of the pandemic were extracted from the military electronic health records. Contact tracing and activity mapping results were obtained from unit-level epidemiological data. A review of the organizations response plans, instructions, and orders was conducted to collate the measures implemented across the same time period. RESULTS: Prompt contact tracing and activity mapping was done for each of the 24 SAF military personnel diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 2020 and June 2020, with possible links among the cases identified and investigated. CONCLUSION: A combination of strategies in the formulation of public health measures based on key principles of early warning and surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and early containment were successful in preventing the formation of COVID-19 clusters within the SAF. This will provide a framework for the management of future pandemics within the military setting, driven by strong governance and leadership, to meet the militarys need to maintain operational readiness in a safe manner.","output":"COVID-19 Monitoring and Response for Military Bases in SingaporePerspectives and Lessons From January to June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the present trial was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of moxifloxacin (400 mg) given intravenously (i.v.) once daily followed by oral moxifloxacin (400 mg) for 7 to 14 days with the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of co-amoxiclav (1.2 g) administered by i.v. infusion three times a day followed by oral co-amoxiclav (625 mg) three times a day, with or without clarithromycin (500 mg) twice daily (i.v. or orally), for 7 to 14 days in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring initial parenteral therapy. A total of 628 patients were enrolled and assessed by evaluation of their clinical and bacteriological responses 5 to 7 days and 21 to 28 days after administration of the last dose of study medication. Although the trial was designed, on the basis of predefined outcomes, to demonstrate the equivalence of the two regimens, the results showed statistically significant higher clinical success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.4%, and for comparator regimen, 85.4%; difference [Delta], 8.05%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91 to 13.19%; P = 0.004) and bacteriological success rates (for moxifloxacin, 93.7%, and for comparator regimen, 81.7%; Delta, 12.06%; 95% CI, 1.21 to 22.91%) for patients treated with moxifloxacin. This superiority was seen irrespective of the severity of the pneumonia and whether or not the combination therapy included a macrolide. The time to resolution of fever was also statistically significantly faster for patients who received moxifloxacin (median time, 2 versus 3 days), and the duration of hospital admission was approximately 1 day less for patients who received moxifloxacin. The treatment was converted to oral therapy immediately after the initial mandatory 3-day period of i.v. administration for a larger proportion of patients in the moxifloxacin group than patients in the comparator group (151 [50.2%] versus 57 [17.8%] patients). There were fewer deaths (9 [3.0%] versus 17 [5.3%]) and fewer serious adverse events (38 [12.6%] versus 53 [16.5%]) in the moxifloxacin group than in the comparator group. The rates of drug-related adverse events were comparable in both groups (38.9% in each treatment group). The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was similar in both groups. Thus, it is concluded that monotherapy with moxifloxacin is superior to that with a standard combination regimen of a beta-lactam and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, co-amoxiclav, with or without a macrolide, clarithromycin, in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to a hospital.","output":"Randomized controlled trial of sequential intravenous (i.v.) and oral moxifloxacin compared with sequential i.v. and oral co-amoxiclav with or without clarithromycin in patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring initial parenteral treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is an emerging behavior worldwide, especially among the youth.

The researchers supporting the use of these medications believe ACE2 functional blockers may block cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus improve patient outcomes. The counter viewpoint argues that continuous use of these drugs results in hyperexpression of ACE2 receptors on respiratory epithelium allowing easier SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry, resulting in enhanced viral replication and tissue damage.

Prognosticators and outcome measures were compared between groups. Sentinel nodes' retrieval and wide local excision (WLE) were offered to all patients as primary treatment. RESULTS 26 patients identified, 15 females with a median age of 69 years (range 3.5-85). Mean Breslow was 7.9  5.7 mm (median 5.8, range 1.8-25.0), and the mean mitotic rate was 4.9  3.8/mm2 (median 4.0, range 0-17). Initial treatment and follow-up were as for cutaneous melanoma. One patient in each group with a palpable stage III underwent primary radical dissection. Sentinel nodes were retrieved in all 20 lymphatic mappings performed and found to be metastatic in 5 (25%) patients. Treatment consisted of completion lymph-node dissection. At a median postoperative follow-up of 62 months (range 8-132), 20 patients were disease-free, including 6 of 7 patients with stage III disease at presentation. Six patients died all of cPDM; 5 of 6 patients had primary ulcerated or epidermal-abutting melanomas. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to highlight cPDM. Diagnosis requires expert pathology review and a tight correlation to the clinical parameters. Patients seem to benefit from WLE with sentinel node retrieval and complete dissection when appropriate. However, clinical guidelines for dissection have changed since the time period of this retrospective review.

To illustrate the framework, we applied it to understanding the host genetics of COVID-19 severity. We identified putative causal genes, including SLC6A20, CXCR6, CCR9, and CCR5 in the locus on 3p21.31, quantifying their effect on mediating expression and on severe COVID-19. We confirmed that individuals who carry the introgressed archaic segment in the locus have a substantially higher risk of developing the severe disease phenotype, estimating its contribution to expression-mediated heritability using a new summary-statistics-based approach we developed here. Through a large-scale phenome-wide scan for the genes in the locus, several potential complications, including inflammatory, immunity, olfactory, and gustatory traits, were identified. Notably, the introgressed segment showed a much higher concentration of expression-mediated causal effect on severity (0.9C11.5 times) than the entire locus, explaining, on average, 15.7% of the causal effect. The region-level framework (implemented in publicly available software, SEGMENT-SCAN) has important implications for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of disease and the rational design of potentially novel therapeutics.","output":"Integrative transcriptomic, evolutionary, and causal inference framework for region-level analysis: Application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Obesity is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years or older. Different lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, self-management) are available but benefits and harms have not been fully quantified comparing all available health promotion interventions.

Numerous studies examine the reasons for changes in the vector of migration policy and indicate various factors of migration influx rate. However, the most recent observations indicate an almost stagnant migration flow being affected by the COVID-19. As a result of the ongoing impacts, the requirements for the quality of human capital will be changed completely, and the volume of GDP will be decreased. As examples of two countries, Germany and Great Britain, having different migration policy approaches, authors analyze the importance of migration flows. Based on this fact, the authors suggest that migration processes can be one of the statistically significant factors affecting GDP per capita. It also can be used in the building of mathematical forecasting models. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) method is used to test the hypothesis. The linear regression is used to build models and show how factor influences the linear approximation. As a result, the hypothesis of the impact of the migration flows on GDP per capita was confirmed with the econometric models' support and their indicated explanatory abilities. Inflation and unemployment rates were considered as complement factors. The results of the models allow predicting migration policy based on migration quotas.

Little is known on the use of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) by the public as preventive measures. This study investigated the prevalence and patterns of TCIM use during the pandemic, and identified factors associated with its use among the general population in Hong Kong. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from November to December 2020. The survey solicited information on the respondents sociodemographic characteristics, risk perception of the pandemic, and use of TCIM before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of TCIM use. RESULTS: In total, 632 responses (completion rate = 88.1%) were analyzed. TCIM was used by 44.0% of respondents during the pandemic. The most popular forms of TCIM were vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 160, 25.3%) and Chinese herbal medicine (n = 122, 19.3%) during the pandemic. The most frequently reported indication was strengthening the immune system, especially for vitamins or other dietary supplements (n = 142/160, 88.8%). Respondents who reported using TCIM were more likely to be female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29C2.59), had higher education attainment (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.39C3.59), and older-aged (age >55 years: aOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04C3.02). Respondents who resided in districts with moderate to high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.07C2.42) and had a higher level of risk perception (aOR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01C1.07) were also more likely to use TCIM. CONCLUSION: TCIM was used commonly in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. While vaccination and social distancing remain the mainstay of controlling the pandemic, professional bodies should proactively consider public preferences and provide information regarding the effectiveness and safety of TCIM for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.","output":"A public survey of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Slavic populations account for over 4.5% of world inhabitants, no centralised, open-source reference database of genetic variation of any Slavic population exists to date. Such data are crucial for clinical genetics, biomedical research, as well as archeological and historical studies. The Polish population, which is homogenous and sedentary in its nature but influenced by many migrations of the past, is unique and could serve as a genetic reference for the Slavic nations. In this study, we analysed whole genomes of 1222 Poles to identify and genotype a wide spectrum of genomic variation, such as small and structural variants, runs of homozygosity, mitochondrial haplogroups, and de novo variants. Common variant analyses showed that the Polish cohort is highly homogenous and shares ancestry with other European populations. In rare variant analyses, we identified 32 autosomal-recessive genes with significantly different frequencies of pathogenic alleles in the Polish population as compared to the non-Finish Europeans, including C2, TGM5, NUP93, C19orf12, and PROP1. The allele frequencies for small and structural variants, calculated for 1076 unrelated individuals, are released publicly as The Thousand Polish Genomes database, and will contribute to the worldwide genomic resources available to researchers and clinicians.","output":"The Thousand Polish GenomesA Database of Polish Variant Allele Frequencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asbestos causes malignant transformation of primary human mesothelial cells (HM), leading to mesothelioma. The mechanisms of asbestos carcinogenesis remain enigmatic, as exposure to asbestos induces HM death. However, some asbestos-exposed HM escape cell death, accumulate DNA damage, and may become transformed. We previously demonstrated that, upon asbestos exposure, HM and reactive macrophages releases the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein that becomes detectable in the tissues near asbestos deposits where HMGB1 triggers chronic inflammation. HMGB1 is also detectable in the sera of asbestos-exposed individuals and mice. Searching for additional biomarkers, we found higher levels of the autophagy marker ATG5 in sera from asbestos-exposed individuals compared to unexposed controls. As we investigated the mechanisms underlying this finding, we discovered that the release of HMGB1 upon asbestos exposure promoted autophagy, allowing a higher fraction of HM to survive asbestos exposure. HMGB1 silencing inhibited autophagy and increased asbestos-induced HM death, thereby decreasing asbestos-induced HM transformation. We demonstrate that autophagy was induced by the cytoplasmic and extracellular fractions of HMGB1 via the engagement of the RAGE receptor and Beclin 1 pathway, while nuclear HMGB1 did not participate in this process. We validated our findings in a novel unique mesothelial conditional HMGB1-knockout (HMGB1-cKO) mouse model. Compared to HMGB1 wild-type mice, mesothelial cells from HMGB1-cKO mice showed significantly reduced autophagy and increased cell death. Autophagy inhibitors chloroquine and desmethylclomipramine increased cell death and reduced asbestos-driven foci formation. In summary, HMGB1 released upon asbestos exposure induces autophagy, promoting HM survival and malignant transformation.","output":"Asbestos induces mesothelial cell transformation via HMGB1-driven autophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of bladder cancer (BCa) has remained high for many years.

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and hospitalised at the cantonal hospital Aarau (Switzerland) between 26 February 2020 and 30 April 2020. Our primary endpoint was severe COVID-19 progression defined as a composite of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 99 patients (median age 67 years [interquartile range 56C76], 37% females) were included and 35% developed severe COVID-19 progression (24% needed ICU treatment, 19% died). Patients had a high burden of comorbidities with a median Charlson comorbidity index of 3 points and a high prevalence of hypertension (57%), chronic kidney disease (28%) and obesity (27%). Baseline characteristics with the highest prognostic value for the primary endpoint by means of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were male gender (0.63) and initial laboratory values including shock markers (lactate on ambient air 0.67; lactate with O2 supply 0.70), markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein 0.72, procalcitonin 0.80) and markers of compromised oxygenation (pO2 0.75 on ambient air), whereas age and comorbidities provided little prognostic information. CONCLUSION This analysis provides insights into the first consecutively hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a Swiss tertiary care hospital during the initial period of the pandemic. Markers of disease progression such as inflammatory markers, markers for shock and impaired respiratory function provided the most prognostic information regarding severe COVID-19 progression in our sample.","output":"Characteristics, predictors and outcomes among 99 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in a tertiary care centre in Switzerland: an observational analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional economic growth theories considered capital and labor as essential growth factors for every economy.

A consensus guideline for stent retriever size selection has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different diameters of Solitaire retrievers on outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 628 patients enrolled from the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke Registry, 256 were treated with the Solitaire 4-mm device and 372, with the 6-mm device. We matched patients treated with the 2 stent sizes using propensity score analysis. The successful outcome was reperfusion as measured by the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score immediately postprocedure and the dichotomized modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality were also recorded. RESULTS After propensity score analysis, group outcomes did not differ. In addition, in patients with atherosclerosis-related occlusion, a higher reperfusion rate (P = .021) was observed in the Solitaire 4 group, as well as a shorter time interval (P = .002) and fewer passes (P = .025). Independent predictors of successful reperfusion in patients with atherosclerotic disease on logistic analysis were the small stent (OR, 3.217; 95% CI, 1.129-9.162; P = .029) and the propensity score acting as a covariate (OR, 52.84; 95% CI, 3.468-805.018; P = .004).

This study determines how managers cope with the changes during COVID-19 from a positive psychology and salutogenic perspective. It employs a hermeneutical research design and an interpretivist paradigm by using a mixed-method research approach in which managers sense of coherence (SOC) is investigated quantitatively through the 29-item Life-Orientation scale and qualitatively through semi-structured interviews. Purposeful and snowball sampling techniques are used. The sample consists of 17 managers. Data were collected in different organizations within South Africa and analysed through content analysis, linking quantitative and qualitative data in a holistic, integrated and complex way. In terms of the quantitative findings, the managers scored at the medium and higher end of the SOC-scale in comprehensibility, followed by manageability and finally meaningfulness. Male managers in the age group 47C57 scored highest. Female and younger managers scored lower on average. Lowest scores in comprehensibility and manageability were scored by a young female manager, while in meaningfulness the oldest male participant scored lowest. The qualitative findings show that high scoring SOC managers apply complex thoughts to the present and future workplace scenario. Individuals with lower SOC scores do not present as much knowledge, complex thinking and argumentation structures during the interview in comprehensibility scores as high scoring SOC managers, yet still acquire resources to manage the workplace (manageability). High meaningfulness scores are associated with creating meaningful workplace interaction (humanChuman and machineChuman), knowledge distribution through technology, impactfulness, experiencing the job as meaningful, including helping others, and achievements. Managers have a complex view of the world and findings show the complex connections of a high/low SOC scores and the managers explorations and systemic understanding regarding their managerial world.

Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test were also obtained and analyzed. Additionally, testing of pooled saliva samples was evaluated. RESULTS: The LOD for the QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test was confirmed to be 100C200 copies/mL. The clinical performance studies using contrived saliva samples indicated that the positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test is 100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus(?) SARS CoV-2 test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference (p = 0.13) between paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from local communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva sample pooling up to 6 samples (1:6 pooling) for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 100%). CONCLUSION: The studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test has a LOD of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirus(?) SARS-CoV-2 test offers a highly desirable testing platform during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Saliva as a testing specimen with or without pooling for SARS-CoV-2 detection by multiplex RT-PCR test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation is strictly interconnected to anti-inflammatory mechanisms to maintain tissue homeostasis. The disruption of immune homeostasis can lead to acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, as cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic diseases and cancer. The knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of these pathological conditions is important to find effective therapies. Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease produced by a variety of immune, non-immune and tumor cells. Apoptotic intracellular and multiple extracellular functions of GrB have been recently identified. Its capability of cleaving extracellular matrix (ECM) components, cytokines, cell receptors and clotting proteins, revealed GrB as a potential multifunctional pro-inflammatory molecule with the capability of contributing to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory conditions, including inflammaging, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Here we give an overview of recent data concerning GrB activity on multiple targets, potentially allowing this enzyme to regulate a wide range of crucial biological processes that play a role in the development, progression and/or severity of inflammatory diseases. We focus our attention on the promotion by GrB of perforin-dependent and perforin-independent (anoikis) apoptosis, inflammation derived by the activation of some cytokines belonging to the IL-1 cytokine family, ECM remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis. A greater comprehension of the pathophysiological consequences of GrB-mediated multiple activities may favor the design of new therapies aim to inhibit different inflammatory pathological conditions such as inflammaging and age-related diseases, EMT and organ fibrosis.","output":"Granzyme B in Inflammatory Diseases: Apoptosis, Inflammation, Extracellular Matrix Remodeling, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the complex relationship between COVID-19 and dementia and how the pandemic has affected the management of patients with dementia. This population resulted particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects and also to the negative effects of the measures taken worldwide to control the spread of the virus. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with dementia were at increased risk for COVID-19 compared to patients without dementia, and diagnosis of dementia represents an independent risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Mortality due to SARS-CoV2 infection in subjects with dementia is 2C5 times higher than in the general population. Cognitive impairment and delirium have been described in COVID-19 survivors. SARS-COV2 pandemic exacerbates the vulnerability of dementia patients and their caregivers, due to the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the indirect effects of the pandemic on the social supports, and the effects on healthcare system on which they depend.

Its involvement in a variety of human cardiac diseases such as aortic stenosis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and various cardiomyopathies make the OSM receptor (OSMR) signaling cascades a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of pharmacological treatment strategies is highly challenging for many reasons. In mouse models of heart disease, OSM elicits opposing effects via activation of the type II receptor complex (OSMR/gp130). Short-term activation of OSMR/gp130 protects the heart after acute injury, whereas chronic activation promotes the development of heart failure. Furthermore, OSM has the ability to integrate signals from unrelated receptors that enhance fetal remodeling (dedifferentiation) of adult cardiomyocytes. Because OSM strongly stimulates the production and secretion of extracellular proteins, it is likely to exert systemic effects, which in turn, could influence cardiac remodeling. Compared with the mouse, the complexity of OSM signaling is even greater in humans because this cytokine also activates the type I leukemia inhibitory factor receptor complex (LIFR/gp130). In this article, we provide an overview of OSM-induced cardiomyocyte remodeling and discuss the consequences of OSMR/gp130 and LIFR/gp130 activation under acute and chronic conditions.","output":"The Role of Oncostatin M and Its Receptor Complexes in Cardiomyocyte Protection, Regeneration, and Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research note investigates the optimal size of pools for pooled, COVID-19 testing when positive pools will be followed up by individual tests of pool members.

To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses evoked by food and social cues after participants (n=40) experienced ten hours of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed selective activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. By contrast, striatal and cortical regions differentiated between craving food versus social interaction. Across deprivation sessions, we find that deprivation narrows and focuses the brains motivational responses to the deprived target.

Results One hundred and thirty-seven of the 217 departments contacted replied, producing a response rate of 61%. There was a 147% increase in the provision of remote access viewing and reporting platforms during the pandemic. Although 578 consultants had access to a viewing platform pre-pandemic, this had increased to 1,431 during the course of the first wave. Conclusion This survey represents work undertaken by UK NHS Trusts in co-ordinating and providing increased home-reporting facilities to UK radiologists during the first wave of this global pandemic. The impact of these facilities has been shown to allow more than just the provision of reporting of both elective and emergency imaging and provides additional flexibility in how UK radiologists can help support and provide services.

OBJECTIVE: We adapted a neighborhood-wide analysis study (NWAS) design to systematically examine associations between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 incidence among different age groups. METHODS: The number of daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 by zip code area in Illinois has been made publicly available by the Illinois Department of Public Health. The number of COVID-19 cases was reported for eight age groups (under 20, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+). We reviewed this data published from May 23 through June 17, 2020 with complete data for all eight age groups and linked the data to neighborhood characteristics measured by the American Community Survey (ACS). Geographic age-specific cumulative incidence (cases per 1000 people) of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the number of daily cumulative cases by the population of the same age group at each zip code area. The association between individual characteristics and COVID-19 incidence was examined using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: At the zip code level, neighborhood socioeconomic status was a more important risk factor of COVID-19 incidence in children and working-age adults than in seniors. Social demographics and housing conditions were important risk factors of COVID-19 incidence in older age groups. We additionally observed significant associations between transportation-related variables and COVID-19 incidences in multiple age groups.

The study is developed with quantitative methods and spatial regression (spatial lag and spatial error using OLS as a benchmark), based on data collected from the Inside Airbnb and Tomslee websites. In the period 2014C2019, the listing trend in Rome has been increasing in absolute numbers. After the start of the pandemic, the trend became negative, and the decline of Airbnb offerings is more substantial for shared accommodation. Airbnb supply is related to the distance from the city centre, the average income of the area, empty apartments, singles and the share of foreign residents coming from high-income countries.

Current research shows its consequences are relevant, however, there is little understanding on burnout and academic engagement moderation in dropout intention. The current study tested a model that relates the effects of coping strategies, social support satisfaction, general distress on academic engagement, burnout, and dropout intention, on medical students. METHODS: Through an online survey a non-probabilistic sample of one Medical Faculty's 1st- and 2nd-year students was recruited. Cross-sectional data were collected using psychometric instruments (Maslach Burnout Inventory C Student Survey, Social Support Satisfaction Scale for College Students, Brief COPE Scale for College Students, University Student Engagement Inventory, and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale), sociodemographic and academic variables, and analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: 532 students (76% response rate) enrolled in the study. Latent variables structural model presented a satisfactory fit to the data and confirmed the expected negative path between burnout and dropout intention ((DI<-SB)=0.430; p<.001) and the latent moderation burnout x engagement ((DI<-SB*SE)=-0.218; p<.001). CONCLUSION: Academic engagement attenuates the impact of burnout on dropout intention, working as a protective factor.

In the first part of the review, the main mechanisms of liver tissue damage and clinical and formological manifestations of drug-induced liver damage are considered. The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), spread by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a challenge to health systems around the world. The global clinical experience gained over the past year in the management of patients with a new coronavirus infection makes it possible to highlight a number of relevant clinical aspects, one of which is drug-induced liver damage associated with the treatment of COVID-19. In the second part of the review, the possible mechanisms of influence of COVID-19 on the hepatobiliary system are considered, which include viral cytotoxicity, a secondary effect of immune dysregu-lation;hypoxia as a result of respiratory failure and subsequent ischemic liver damage;reactivation of already existing liver pathology and drug damage to the liver. It has been established that a large number of drugs used to treat COVID-19-antiviral agents, antibacterials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids and others-have hepatoxic effects and can cause liver damage. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, for patients with a new coronavirus infection and drug-induced liver damage, a rational, pathogenetically justified choice of a hepatoprotective drug is of particular importance.

Results of such tests can be reported as cycle threshold (Ct) values, which may provide semi-quantitative or indirect measurements of viral load. Previous reports have examined temporal trends in Ct values over the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using testing data collected during a prospective household transmission investigation of outpatient and mild COVID-19 cases, we examined the relationship between Ct values of the viral RNA N1 target and demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics collected through participant interviews and daily symptom diaries. RESULTS: We found Ct values are lowest (corresponding to higher viral RNA concentration) soon after symptom onset and are significantly correlated with time elapsed since onset (p<0.001); within 7 days after symptom onset, the median Ct value was 26.5 compared with a median Ct value of 35.0 occurring 21 days after onset. Ct values were significantly lower among participants under 18 years of age (p=0.01) and those reporting upper respiratory symptoms at the time of sample collection (p=0.001) and were higher among participants reporting no symptoms (p=0.05).

In the clinical setting however, NK cell cytotoxicity against sarcoma cells has been mainly studied in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, where a rapid immune reconstitution of NK cells plays a key role in the control of the disease, known as graft-versus-tumor effect. In this review, we discuss the evidence for the current and future strategies to enhance the NK cell-versus-pediatric sarcoma effect, with a clinical focus. The different approaches encompass enhancing antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity, counteracting the NK cell mechanisms of self-tolerance, and developing adoptive NK cell therapy including chimeric antigen receptor-expressing NK cells.","output":"Enhancing Natural Killer Cell Targeting of Pediatric Sarcoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women are at increased risk for morbidity owing to infection with the COVID-19 virus.1 Vaccination presents an important strategy to mitigate illness in this population. However, there is a paucity of data on vaccination safety and pregnancy outcomes because pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase III clinical trials. Our objective was to describe the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of women who received a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant during the first 4 months of vaccine availability. STUDY DESIGN: This was an institutional review board-approved descriptive study of pregnant women at New York University Langone Health who received at least 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccination approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) from the time of the FDA Emergency Use Authorization to April 22, 2021. Eligible women were identified via search of the electronic medical record (EMR) system. Vaccine administration was ascertained via immunization records from the New York State Department of Health. Women were excluded if they were vaccinated before conception or during the postpartum period. Charts were reviewed for maternal demographics and pregnancy outcomes. Descriptive analyses were performed using the R software version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation, Boston, MA). RESULTS: We identified 424 pregnant women who received an mRNA vaccination. Of those, 348 (82.1%) received both doses and 76 (17.9%) received only 1 dose. The maternal characteristics and vaccination information are shown in Table 1. Of the included women, 4.9% had a history of a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis before vaccination. After vaccination, no patient in our cohort was diagnosed with COVID-19. In terms of the pregnancy outcomes, 9 women had spontaneous abortions, 3 terminated their pregnancies, and 327 have ongoing pregnancies. Of the women included, 85 delivered liveborn infants. There were no stillbirths in our population. Of the 9 spontaneous abortions, 8 occurred during the first trimester at a range of 6 to 13 weeks' gestation. There was 1 second trimester loss. The rate of spontaneous abortion among women vaccinated in the first trimester was 6.5%. The 327 women with ongoing pregnancies have been followed for a median of 4.6 weeks (range, 0-17 weeks) following their most recent dose. A total of 113 (34.6%) women, initiated vaccination during the first trimester, 178 (54.4%) initiated vaccination during the second trimester, and 36 (11.0%) during the third trimester. Following the vaccination, 2 fetuses (0.6%) developed intrauterine growth restriction, whereas 5 (1.5%) were diagnosed with anomalies. Outcomes for the 85 women who delivered are shown in Table 2. Of the women who delivered, 18.8% were diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. The rate of preterm birth was 5.9%. One preterm delivery was medically indicated, whereas the remaining 3 were spontaneous. A total of 15.3% of neonates required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Of the NICU admissions, 61.5% were because of hypoglycemia or an evaluation for sepsis. Other reasons for admission included prematurity, hypothermia, and transient tachypnea of the newborn. Of all the neonates, 12.2% were small for gestational age (SGA) per the World Health Organization standards. CONCLUSION: This series describes our experience with women who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. In line with other published findings,2 we observed no concerning trends. There were no stillbirths. Our 6.5% rate of spontaneous abortion is within the expected rate of 10%,3 and our preterm birth rate of 5.9% is below the national average of 9.5%.4 Our rate of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders is higher than our baseline institutional rate of 9.5%, however, this may be because of the underlying characteristics of our study population or skewing of our small sample size. Our 12.2% rate of SGA neonates is near the expected value based on the definition that 10% of neonates will be SGA at birth. The NICU admission rate is at par with our institutional rate of 12%. To date, most women in this series have had uncomplicated pregnancies and have delivered at-term. Strengths of this study include using the EMR system to identify subjects and gather data. We did not rely on self-enrollment and self-report, thereby reducing selection and recall bias. By performing manual chart reviews, we obtained detailed and reliable information about individual patients. One limitation of this study is the lack of a matched control group consisting of unvaccinated pregnant women and therefore direct conclusions could not be drawn about the relative risks of complications. In addition, our cohort is small and may not be generalizable. Finally, many women included are healthcare workers who had early access to vaccinations. As more pregnant women become eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinations, there is an urgent need to report on the maternal, neonatal, and obstetrical outcomes of COVID-19 vaccinations during pregnancy. The results of this study can be used to counsel and reassure pregnant patients facing this decision.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy: early experience from a single institution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To assess clinical and prognosis differences in patients with Covid-19 and STEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a nationwide registry of consecutive patients managed within 42 specific STEMI-care networks, we compared patient and procedure characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts, according to whether they had Covid-19. Among 1010 consecutive STEMI patients, 91 were identified as Covid-19 (10.9%). With the exception of smoking status (more frequent in non-Covid-19) and previous coronary artery disease (more frequent in Covid-19), clinical characteristics were similar between groups, but Covid-19 patients had more heart failure on arrival (31.9% vs 18.4%, p=0.002).

We also reviewed: COVID-19 articles in NEJM, Lancet, BMJ, JAMA, clinical trial protocols, grey literature, surveillance data and preprint articles on COVID-19 in MedRxiv to evaluate if the association between ethnicity and clinical outcomes were reported and what they showed. PROSPERO:180654. Findings: Of 207 articles in the database search, five reported ethnicity; two reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 690 articles identified from medical journals, 12 reported ethnicity; three reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 209 preprints, 34 reported ethnicity C 13 found Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals had an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 12 reported worse clinical outcomes, including ITU admission and mortality, in BAME patients compared to White patients. Of 12 grey literature reports, seven with original data reported poorer clinical outcomes in BAME groups compared to White groups. Interpretation: Data on ethnicity in patients with COVID-19 in the published medical literature remains limited. However, emerging data from the grey literature and preprint articles suggest BAME individuals are at an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to White individuals and also worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19.

Catalytic residues and cleavage sites for each of the SHFV PLP1s were predicted by alignment of the SHFV PLP1 region sequences with each other as well as with those of other arteriviruses, and the predicted catalytic residues were shown to be proximal by homology modeling of the SHFV nsp1s on porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) nsp1 crystal structures. The functionality of the predicted catalytic Cys residues and cleavage sites was tested by analysis of the autoproteolytic products generated in in vitro transcription/translation reactions done with wild-type or mutant SHFV nsp1 constructs. Cleavage sites were also analyzed by mass spectroscopy analysis of selected immunoprecipitated cleavage products. The data showed that each of the three SHFV PLP1s is an active protease. Cys63 was identified as the catalytic Cys of SHFV PLP1 and is adjacent to an Ala instead of the canonical Tyr observed in other arterivirus PLP1s. SHFV PLP1 is able to cleave at both downstream and upstream nsp1 junction sites. Although intermediate precursor polyproteins as well as alternative products generated by each of the SHFV PLP1s cleaving at sites within the N-terminal region of nsp1 were produced in the in vitro reactions, Western blotting of SHFV-infected, MA104 cell lysates with SHFV nsp1 protein-specific antibodies detected only the three mature nsp1 proteins. IMPORTANCE SHFV is unique among arteriviruses in having three N-terminal papain-like protease 1 (PLP1) domains. Other arteriviruses encode one or two active PLP1s. This is the first functional study of the SHFV PLP1s. Analysis of the products of in vitro autoprocessing of an N-terminal SHFV nonstructural 1a polypeptide fragment showed that each of the three SHFV PLP1s is active, and the predicted catalytic Cys residues and cleavage sites for each PLP1 were confirmed by testing mutant constructs. Several unique features of the SHFV PLP1s were discovered. The SHFV PLP1 catalytic Cys63 is unique among arterivirus PLP1s in being adjacent to an Ala instead of a Trp. Other arterivirus PLP1s cleave only in cis at a single downstream site, but SHFV PLP1 can cleave at both the downstream nsp1-nsp2 and upstream nsp1-nsp1 junctions. The three mature nsp1 proteins were produced both in the in vitro reactions and in infected cells.","output":"Functional analyses of the three simian hemorrhagic fever virus nonstructural protein 1 papain-like proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individual decision-making about social distancing, self-quarantine and self-isolation is crucial in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. In the rapidly evolving pandemic, little is known about how different government communication strategies may systematically affect peoples attitudes to staying home or going out, nor the extent to which people perceive and process the risk of different scenarios. In this study, we report results from a sample of 581 participants (residing in the United Kingdom), and we examine the degree to which participants attitudes regarding the permissibility of leaving ones home are (1) sensitive to different levels of risk of viral transmission in specific scenarios, (2) sensitive to communication framings that are either imperative or that invite reasoning about scenarios, or (3) creating loopholes for themselves when scenarios are framed with reference to the participants themselves rather than in general terms. We find that participants attitudes to social distancing are sensitive to the level of risk of transmission, and that when scenarios are framed in imperative terms, rather than when their reasoning is encouraged, participants have more impermissive attitudes to going out in Minimal Risk scenarios, with a trend of decreased permissiveness more generally;for self-loopholes, more research is needed to determine if participants make exceptions for themselves. Thus, subject to the limitations of this study, during phases where it is important to promote self-isolation for all scenarios, including those perceived to be low risk, imperative communication may be best.","output":"Risk perception and personal responsibility during COVID-19: An experimental study of the role of imperative vs reasoning-based communication for self-isolation attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Role of pediatric cases in secondary transmission of COVID-19 is not well understood.

To date, issues related to the protection of medical workers from COVID-19 infection, including immunological protection, are of particular interest. The aim of the study was to explore seroprevalence of the IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in various groups of medical workers with the following assessment of the risk of COVID-19, depending on the seropositivity and occupational group. Materials and methods. The study of the strength of immunity to COVID-19 was carried out within the framework of the large-scale Rospotrebnadzor program to assess population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population of the Russian Federation, considering the protocol recommended by WHO, on the basis of the laboratories of the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Republic of Tatarstan. From the sample of the study conducted in the Republic of Tatarstan, medical workers (301) were selected without a history of a new coronavirus infection and with no clinical symptoms of this disease at the time of biomaterial sampling ( June 2020);the absence of the transferred new coronavirus infection was verified by the Unified State Information System \\"Electronic Health of the Republic of Tatarstan\\". The comparison group included 52 employees belonging to the engineering and technical personnel and not employed in medical institutions who met the above inclusion criteria. In the aggregate, the observation group (medical workers and the comparison group) included 12.1% of the participants in the population study. Results. The rate of seropositivity was 36.5% in the control groups, 23.7%  in doctors, and 38.9%  in nurses. Compared to doctors, seroprevalence was higher in nurses. The employment of medical workers in temporary infectious diseases hospitals did not affect the production of the IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein. A relatively low prevalence of seropositivity among doctors of temporary infectious diseases hospitals was revealed. The probability of seroconversion decreased with age and did not depend on gender or history of recent contacts with COVID-19 patients. The survival analysis showed that the probability of remaining healthy by the end of the follow-up was the lowest among doctors from medical and preventive institutions that did not serve as temporary infectious diseases hospitals. The risk of COVID-19 in seronegative individuals was higher, but without statistical significance. Conclusion. According to the data of immunological studies for the presence of IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it was found that the prevalence of seroprevalence in nurses is significantly higher than that of doctors, nurses of medical and prophylactic organizations of young age have higher seroprevalence to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2. According to prospective observation, it was revealed that doctors of medical and prophylactic organizations that are not classified as temporary infectious diseases hospitals have a higher risk of developing a symptomatic form of COVID-19, which may be due to both the insufficient effectiveness of anti-epidemic measures and the peculiarities of the immune response and approaches, used to evaluate it. In the current epidemic situation, the detection of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be used to decide on the distribution of responsibilities among medical personnel. ? 2021, Izmerov Research Institute of Occupational Medicine.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in human faecal samples and SARS-CoV-2 activity in faeces from COVID-19 patients have been observed. Methods Starting from these observations, an experimental design was developed to cultivate in vitro faecal microbiota from infected individuals, to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and to collect data on the relationship between faecal bacteria and the virus. Results Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2-related peptides have been detected in 30-day bacterial cultures and characterised. Discussion Our observations are compatible with a 'bacteriophage-like' behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge has not been observed or described before. These results are unexpected and hint towards a novel hypothesis on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and on the COVID-19 epidemiology.

Coping strategies used by students to deal with these circumstances were also identified. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 Irish students during the third wave of COVID-19 (January 2021) and the strictest lockdown measures. Thematic analysis identified three themes which highlighted how students were negotiating change (theme 1), both in terms of lifestyle, academic life and social interactions. As a result of these major shifts in lifestyle, many experienced feelings of loss (theme 2) at an intrapersonal, interpersonal and organisational level. Despite these challenging experiences of change and loss, participants also reflected on the positive aspects of lockdown, such as personal growth and improved social and family relationships (theme 3). Close relationships, goal setting, and self-care were identified as key coping strategies. These findings expands existing research on the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the important role of third level institutions in promoting students self-efficacy and personal development along with academic achievement.","output":"A qualitative exploration of the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on Irish university students (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. PURPOSE: To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. RESULTS: CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. CONCLUSION: The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.","output":"Temporal Changes of CT Findings in 90 Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"My postdoc was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) as part of a program to attract foreigners to Japan.

In 2002, Thailand began active, population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia in Sa Kaeo Province. METHODS: Full-time surveillance officers conducted active case ascertainment at every hospital, and routine audits and a community cluster survey promoted complete and accurate reporting. A case of pneumonia was defined as acute infection with signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and evidence of new infiltrates. An independent panel of radiologists reviewed digital images of all radiographs. RESULTS: Between September 2002 and August 2003, 777 patients met the case definition. The measured minimum incidence was 177/100 000 but the estimated incidence was as high as 580/100 000 with full adjustment for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care. Seventy-two (9%) patients died and 28% were known to be HIV positive. Fifteen (2%) patients had pneumonia twice during the year. The average cost of hospitalization for an episode of pneumonia ranged from US$490.80 to $628.60. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia is a significant and costly public health problem in Thailand.

Research results are listed as follow: (1) Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou. (2) The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods, namely, the 10(th) five-year plan period (2003C2005), the 11(th) five-year plan period (2005C2010), and the 12(th) five-year plan period (2010C2013). The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different five-year plan periods. (3) The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector. (4) The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector.","output":"Features and drivers for energy-related carbon emissions in mega city: The case of Guangzhou, China based on an extended LMDI model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global pandemic recently.

Human studies, however, cannot provide the controlled response to infection and complex immunological insight that are only possible with preclinical studies. Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose. Unlike in mice and non-human primates, mRNA-1273- mediated immunity was non-sterilizing and coincided with an anamnestic response. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue permitted high resolution analysis which is not possible in vaccinated humans. mRNA-1273 prevented inflammatory cell infiltration and the reduction of lymphocyte proportions, but enabled antiviral responses conducive to lung homeostasis. Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters. Our results support the use of mRNA-1273 in a two-dose schedule and provides insight into the potential responses within the lungs of vaccinated humans who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"mRNA-1273 efficacy in a severe COVID-19 model: attenuated activation of pulmonary immune cells after challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This corrects the article on p. e11 in vol. 36, PMID: 33398945.","output":"Erratum: Correction of Text in the Article Pediatric Emergency Department Utilization and Coronavirus Disease in Daegu, Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address the frequent emergence of ecological problems, ecology has intersected with various disciplines. From the perspective of linguistic ecology, ecological literacy is an important concept that combines the subjects of ecology and linguistics. It not only discusses ecological issues, but also establishes a linguistic framework. Here, we constructed a quantitative method of assessing ecological literacy from the perspective of linguistic ecology. Ecological literacy was divided into five parts: ecological knowledge literacy, ecological awareness literacy, ecological ethics literacy, ecological emotional literacy, and ecological behavioral literacy. Each of these was set with four quantitative indicators that were evaluated through eight questions. A case study was conducted to investigate the ecological literacy of the inhabitants of Guiyang City, one of Chinas top ten ecologically advanced cities. The results showed that the proposed assessment method was an effective way to evaluate the level of ecological literacy comprehensively. In the case analysis, the overall ecological literacy level of Guiyang inhabitants was relatively good, and the levels of the five specific dimensions of them in descending order were as follows: ecological ethics literacy, ecological emotional literacy, ecological awareness literacy, ecological knowledge literacy, and ecological behavioral literacy.

A cross-sectional survey-based study was designed to evaluate the oral health KAB of dental students in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The study utilized translated versions of the Hiroshima University Dental Behavioural Inventory (HU-DBI), and it aimed to recruit students from all Czech and Slovak dental schools. A total of 487 students were included in this study, out of which 372 (76.4%) were females, 271 (55.6%) were enrolled in preclinical years, 68 (14%) reported smoking tobacco at least once a week, and 430 (88.3%) reported problematic internet use. The mean HU-DBI score of Czech and Slovak dental students (8.18  1.80) was comparable with the previously reported scores of dental students in Nordic and Western European countries. Czech students (9.34  1.29) had a significantly higher score than their Slovak counterparts (7.56  1.73).

Methods: A retrospective study of referrals to the Belfast pPCI service between 23 March and 9 June 2020 C the period of the first full lockdown in the UK C was performed. All ECGs were reviewed alongside patient history. A pPCI turndown was deemed inappropriate if the review demonstrated that the criteria to qualify for pPCI had been met. The number of pPCIs was compared with 2019. Results: The unit had 388 referrals in 78 days, from which 134 patients were accepted for pPCI and 235 referrals were turned down. Of these, nine (4%) were deemed inappropriate. No referrals were turned down because of COVID-19. Of the nine inappropriate cases, six had pPCI following re-referral, two had routine PCI and one had takotsubo syndrome. From the accepted cohort, 85% had pPCI. In the appropriate turndown cohort, there was a final cardiovascular diagnosis in 53% (n=127) of patients, 1-year mortality was 16% (n=38), 55% (n=21) of which were due to a cardiovascular death. There was a 29% reduction in the number of pPCIs performed compared with 2019. Conclusion: During the first wave of COVID-19 there was a significant reduction in the number of pPCIs performed at the Department of Cardiology at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. This was not due to an increase in referrals being inappropriately turned down. The majority of the cohort who had their referral turned down had a final cardiovascular diagnosis unrelated to STEMI; 1-year mortality in this group was significant.","output":"Evaluating the Impact of COVID-19 on a Regional Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Service During the First Wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Prognostic Utility of Baseline 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Levels in Hospitalised COVID-19 Patients: Hope or Hype?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, in the time SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there is increasing interest among the medical community in post-COVID-19 residual symptoms including structural and functional changes in different organs and systems The symptom characteristic and parameters of these changes in the period after illness are in the process of registration and complete clarification, and the first results were published It becomes clear that symptoms of COVID-19 (over 30 in number) even among those with a mild form of the disease remain for a long time after the acute phase in a large number of patients More data are needed on the somatic, mental and emotional characteristics of patients who have undergone COVID-19, the so-called ?prolonged COVID-19 syndrome, despite the lack of a generally accepted definition Knowledge of its clinical characteristic will help physicians to recognize its manifestations, and the healthcare system to prepare for its prevention and treatment Biomed Rev 2020;31: 117-123","output":"Ongoing covid-19 syndrome and post-covid-19 syndrome: Long-term symptoms and residual changes after sars-cov-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe forms of COVID-19 can evolve into pneumonia, featured by acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

OSWs reported less confidence in counseling parents on end-of-life issues and assisting families with non-traditional household structures. The majority of participants reported needing more time in their clinical practice to sufficiently address parents' psychosocial needs. Nearly 90% of participants were interested in receiving further training on the care of parents with advanced cancer. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: To improve the care of parents with advanced cancer, it is critical to understand how the psychosocial oncology workforce perceives its clinical practice needs. Study findings suggest an opportunity for enhanced training, particularly with respect to end-of-life needs and in response to the changing household structure of American families.","output":"Addressing the needs of parents with advanced cancer: Attitudes, practice behaviors, and training experiences of oncology social workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: As a global pandemic is inevitable, real-time monitoring of transmission is vital for containing the spread of COVID-19. The main objective of this study was to report the real-time effective reproduction numbers (R(t)) and case fatality rates (CFR) in Europe. METHODS: Data for this study were obtained mainly from the World Health Organization website, up to March 9, 2020. R(t) were estimated by exponential growth rate (EG) and time-dependent (TD) methods. 'R0' package in R was employed to estimate R(t) by fitting the existing epidemic curve. Both the na?ve CFR (nCFR) and adjusted CFR (aCFR) were estimated. RESULTS: With the EG method, R(t) was 3.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.17-3.38) for Italy, 6.32 (95% CI 5.72-6.99) for France, 6.07 (95% CI 5.51-6.69) for Germany, and 5.08 (95% CI 4.51-5.74) for Spain. With the TD method, the R value for March 9 was 3.10 (95% CI 2.21-4.11) for Italy, 6.56 (95% CI 2.04-12.26) for France, 4.43 (95% CI 1.83-7.92) for Germany, and 3.95 (95% CI 0-10.19) for Spain.

The Nobel Prizes awarded in 2008 and 2010 for research on the development of green fluorescent proteins and super-resolved fluorescence imaging are proof of this (2014). Fluorescent probes, smart polymer machines, fluorescent chemosensors, fluorescence molecular thermometers, fluorescent imaging, drug delivery carriers, and other applications make fluorescent polymers (FPs) exciting materials. Two major branches can be distinguished in the field: (1) macromolecules with fluorophores in their structure and (2) aggregation-induced emission (AIE) FPs. In the first, the polymer (which may be conjugated) contains a fluorophore, conferring photoluminescent properties to the final material, offering tunable structures, robust mechanical properties, and low detection limits in sensing applications when compared to small-molecule or inorganic luminescent materials. In the latter, AIE FPs use a novel mode of fluorescence dependent on the aggregation state. AIE FP intra- and intermolecular interactions confer synergistic effects, improving their properties and performance over small molecules aggregation-induced, emission-based fluorescent materials (AIEgens). Despite their outstanding advantages (over classic polymers) of high emission efficiency, signal amplification, good processability, and multiple functionalization, AIE polymers have received less attention. This review examines some of the most significant advances in the broad field of FPs over the last six years, concluding with a general outlook and discussion of future challenges to promote advancements in these promising materials that can serve as a springboard for future innovation in the field.","output":"Fluorescent Polymers Conspectus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and/or airflow limitation due to pulmonary emphysema. Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma may all be associated with airflow limitation; therefore, exacerbation of asthma may be associated with the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses. COPD and asthma have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus, are also frequently detected during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections, which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative stage.

Interdependence theory has been widely used to understand how relationship partners influence health behavior, including how sexual minority male (SMM) couples regulate HIV risk. Couples with better relationship functioning tend to be more successful at negotiating joint (shared) goals and subsequently accomplishing them. The study recruited 134 cis-male, SARS-CoV-2 negative adults in relationships with cis-male partners from phone-based social networking applications. Participants completed an online survey assessing relationship functioning (Perceived Relationship Components Questionnaire), COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and risk perceptions. Partners' consensus around joint COVID-19 prevention effort was assessed using an adapted version of the Preferences for Sexual Health Outcomes scale. Path analyses indicated that consensus for joint prevention effort predicted social distancing (B = 0.23; p = .001) and the number of other COVID-19 prevention behaviors engaged in (B = 0.17; p = .003) above and beyond perceived risk and relationship functioning. Relationship satisfaction predicted higher levels of consensus for joint COVID-19 prevention effort (B = 0.40; p = .029). Findings suggest that the theoretical foundations of successful HIV prevention interventions that utilize joint goal formation may generalize to the prediction of COVID-19 prevention behavior and may be leveraged to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among SMM in relationships. Interventions that overlook the potential for dyadic regulation of health behavior may miss opportunities to capitalize on shared coping resources and fail to address relational barriers to prevention.","output":"Partners' Consensus About Joint Effort and COVID-19 Prevention Among Sexual Minority Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of urban tech economies calls attention to the multidimensional spatiality of ecosystems made up of people and organizations that produce new digital technology.

During the Ars Electronica 2020 Festival for Art, Technology and Society (Linz, Austria), we invited visitors to exploratively interact with an industrial robot, exhibiting restricted interaction capabilities: extending and retracting its arm, depending on the movements of the volunteer. The movements of the arm were pre-programmed and telecontrolled for safety reasons (which was not obvious to the participants). We recorded video data of these interactions and investigated general nonverbal behaviours of the humans interacting with the robot, as well as nonverbal behaviours of people in the audience. Our results showed that people were more interested in exploring the robot's action and perception capabilities than just reproducing the interaction game as introduced by the instructors.

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from the 10(th) to 17(th) March 2020 in China. A structured e-questionnaire containing general information, the Chinese version of Brief Social Rhythm Scale, and Zungs self-rating scales of depression and anxiety (SDS and SAS) was posted and collected online through a public media (i.e. EQxiu online questionnaire platform). Scores in sleeping, getting up, and socializing (SGS) rhythm and eating, physical practice, and entertainment (EPE) rhythm were compared among and between participants with different sociodemographic backgrounds including gender, age, education, current occupation, annual income, health status, and chronic disease status. Correlations of SDS and SAS with SGS-scale and EPE-scale were also analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 5854 participants were included. There were significant differences in the scores of SGS-scale and EPE-scale among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds. The scores were significantly higher in the groups with female gender, low education level, lower or higher than average income, poor health status, ages of 26C30 years or older than 61 years, nurses and subjects with divorce or widow status. There were also significant differences in SAS and SDS scores among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds (all P< 0.05). The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety was 24.3% and 12.6%, respectively, with nurses having the highest rates of depression (32.94%) and anxiety (18.98%) among the different occupational groups.

One Health approaches should be integrated into these activities to reduce the risk posed by many zoonoses. Coronaviruses are emerging as important zoonotic agents, with the potential to easily cross species barriers, as also recently demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic derived by SARS-CoV-2. Genetic resistance to coronavirus infections can be determined by variants of the host (animal) genome segregating within species. In this study, we mined the genome of more than 500 cattle to identify variants that could be involved so as to define different levels of susceptibility and/or resistance to coronavirus diseases in this important livestock species. Using comparative analyses across species, we identified several single amino acid polymorphisms that might alter the function of key proteins involved in the basic biological mechanisms underlying the infection processes in cattle. This study provided new elements to consider genetic variability of the host (cattle) as a potential risk factor to be considered in One Health perspectives. ABSTRACT: Epidemiological and biological characteristics of coronaviruses and their ability to cross species barriers are a matter of increasing concerns for these zoonotic agents. To prevent their spread, One Health approaches should be designed to include the host (animal) genome variability as a potential risk factor that might confer genetic resistance or susceptibility to coronavirus infections. At present, there is no example that considers cattle genetic resources for this purpose. In this study, we investigated the variability of six genes (ACE2, ANPEP, CEACAM1 and DPP4 encoding for host receptors of coronaviruses; FURIN and TMPRSS2 encoding for host proteases involved in coronavirus infection) by mining whole genome sequencing datasets from more than 500 cattle of 34 Bos taurus breeds and three related species. We identified a total of 180 protein variants (44 already known from the ARS-UCD1.2 reference genome). Some of them determine altered protein functions or the virusChost interaction and the related virus entry processes. The results obtained in this study constitute a first step towards the definition of a One Health strategy that includes cattle genetic resources as reservoirs of host gene variability useful to design conservation and selection programs to increase resistance to coronavirus diseases.","output":"One Health and Cattle Genetic Resources: Mining More than 500 Cattle Genomes to Identify Variants in Candidate Genes Potentially Affecting Coronavirus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this viewpoint is to consider the impact of the current Covid-19 crisis on the educational prospects of young children attending early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings.

Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: The search included five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original English articles reporting Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention in pregnancy published from January 2010 to July 2019. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%).

The ozone-dependent ROS-mediated fatty acid oxidation leads to the formation of lipid ozonization products (LOPs), which act as signal transducers by triggering ROS signaling and therefore mitohormetic processes. These processes ultimately activate survival mechanisms at a cellular level, such as the Nrf2/Keap1/ARE system activation, the AMPK/FOXO/mTOR/Sir1 pathway and the Nrf2/NF-kB cross talk. Furthermore, indirectly, via these pathways, LOPs trigger the HIF-1 pathway, the HO-1 signaling and the NO/iNOS biochemical machinery.

Methods: In an observational manikin study paramedics and emergency physicians performed Advanced-Cardiac-Life-Support in three settings: ERC guidelines 2015 (Control), Covid-19-guidelines as suggested with minimum staff (Covid-19-minimal-personnel);Covid-19-guidelines with paramedics and an emergency physician (Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager). Main outcome measures were no-flow-time, quality metrics as defined by ERC and time intervals to first chest compression, oxygen supply, intubation and first rhythm analysis. Data were presented as mean (standard deviation). Results: 30 resuscitation scenarios were completed. No-flow-time was markly prolonged in Covid-19-minimal-personnel [11337 sec] compared to Control [559 sec;p<0.001] and Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager [7638 sec;p<0.001]. In both Covid-19-groups chest compressions started later [Control: 215 sec, Covid-19-minimal-personnel: 326 sec;Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager: 377 sec;each p<0.001 vs. control], but oxygen supply [Control: 7719 sec;Covid-19-minimal-personnel: 295 sec;Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager: 347 sec;each p<0.001 vs. control] and first intubation attempt [Control: 17844 sec;Covid-19-minimal-personnel: 11114 sec;Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager: 13120 sec;each p<0.001 vs. control] were earlier than in the control group. However, succesful intubation was similar [Control: 19848 sec;Covid-19-minimal-personnel: 18142 sec;Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager: 13025 sec] due to a longer intubation time in Covid-19-minimal-personnel [6135 sec] compared to Covid-19-advanced-airway-manager (p=0.002) and control [196 sec;p<0.001]. Time to first rhythm analysis was more than doubled in Covid-19-minimal-personnel [13896 sec] compared to control [5012 sec, p<0.001]. Conclusion: Covid-19-guidelines led to earlier attempts at intubation, delay in starting chest compressions, longer interruption in chest compression and markedly worsen the quality of resuscitation. These negative effects are attenuated by increasing the number of staff and addition of an experienced airway manager. Specific indications for Covid-19-guidelines are urgently required to carefully balance the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 for the staff vs. the potentially worse outcome for the patients.","output":"What is the Impact of the European Resuscitation Council Covid-19 Guidelines on Resuscitation Quality C A Manakin Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 19-year-old female with a history of pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) presented with two aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (C-SCC) in the right hand. The patient was diagnosed with pre-B cell ALL at four years of age. She underwent chemotherapy with initial remission. However, recurrence of the pre-B cell ALL required an unrelated allogeneic cord hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT). Post-transplant, the patient developed Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), which was treated with immunosuppressant therapy for six years until resolution. Fourteen years following the transplant, the patient developed a morbilliform drug eruption secondary to clindamycin. She consequently received prednisone treatment. During the treatment period, the patient developed a new ulcerated and tender nodule on the dorsal aspect of her right hand. Further histopathological biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of C-SCC, which required excision. Ten months following the excision, the patient developed an additional C-SCC nodule on the same right hand, separated by 2.6 cm from the prior C-SCC. She was referred for a ray resection procedure. This case illustrates a patient with multiple risk factors that may have contributed to the continued development of C-SCC. Such risk factors include: a prolonged course of immunosuppressant medications and voriconazole treatment. Additional research is needed to investigate the etiologies and risks of C-SCC development in patients who require a transplant and long-duration immunosuppressive therapy.","output":"Aggressive Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas Following Treatment for Graft-versus-Host Disease: A Case Report and Review of Risk Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 have many potentially negative interrelationships, which may influence the course of infection and clinical outcomes.

Within a short period of time the outbreak developed exponentially into a pandemic that infected millions of people, with a global death toll of more than 500,000 during its first 6 months. Eventually, the novel disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the new virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to all known pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 has been accompanied by a large degree of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and economic disaster worldwide. Despite multiple publications and increasing knowledge regarding the biological secrets of SARS-CoV-2, as of the writing of this paper, there is neither an approved vaccine nor medication to prevent infection or cure for this highly infectious disease. Past pandemics were caused by a wide range of microbes, primarily viruses, but also bacteria. Characteristically, a significant proportion of them originated in different animal species (zoonoses). Since an understanding of the microbial cause of these diseases was unveiled relatively late in human history, past pandemics were often attributed to strange causes including punishment from God, demonic activity, or volatile unspecified substances. Although a high case fatality ratio was common to all pandemic diseases, some striking clinical characteristics of each disease allowed contemporaneous people to clinically diagnose the infection despite null microbiological information. In comparison to past pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 has tricky and complex mechanisms that have facilitated its rapid and catastrophic spread worldwide.","output":"COVID-19 Compared to Other Pandemic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conjugation of antibiotics with polymers is an emerging strategy to improve the performance of these important drugs. Here, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) was conjugated with amphiphilic poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) block copolymers to investigate whether the activity of the antibiotic was enhanced due to additionally induced membrane activity. The resulting polymer-antibiotic conjugates (PACs) are an order of magnitude more active against the bacterial strain Staphylococcus aureus than CIP and show high activities against numerous pathogenic bacterial strains. Their high activity depends on an optimal hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance (HHB) of the POx tail. Mechanistic studies revealed that the derivatization of CIP required for the polymer conjugation lowers the affinity of the antibiotic to its target topoisomerase IV. However, the amphiphilic PACs are most likely concentrated within the bacterial cytoplasm, which overcompensates the loss of affinity and results in high antibacterial activity. In addition, the development of resistance in S. aureus and Escherichia coli is slowed down. More importantly, the amphiphilic PACs are active against CIP-resistant S. aureus and E. coli. The PACs with the highest activity are not cytotoxic toward human stem cells and do not lyse blood cells in saturated solution.","output":"Conjugates of Ciprofloxacin and Amphiphilic Block Copoly(2-alkyl-2-oxazolines)s Overcome Efflux Pumps and Are Active against CIP-Resistant Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions put in place to prevent or reduce the spread of the disease led to anxiety, concern and stress for many people.

Leaching of N from fertilized soils to rivers is the main source of N pollution in China, but the exposure of a growing inland water area to direct atmospheric N deposition and N leaching caused by N deposition on the terrestrial ecosystem, together with increased N deposition and decreased N flow, also tends to raise N concentrations in most inland waters. The contribution of this previously ignored source of N deposition to freshwaters is estimated in this study, as well as mitigation strategies. The results show that the annual amounts of N depositions ranged from 4.9 to 16.6 kg  ha-1  yr-1 in the 1990s to exceeding 20 kg  ha-1  yr-1 in the 2010s over most of regions in China, so the total mass of N (the net contribution of N deposition to the increase in N concentration) for lakes, rivers and reservoirs change from 122.26 Gg N  yr-1 in the 1990s to 237.75 Gg N  yr-1 in the 2010s.

Emerging reports indicate CD147/Basigin (BSG), highly expressed in endothelial cells (EC), is an alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor. To date, the mechanism by which the virus infects and disrupts the heart vascular cells was not identified yet. Moreover, cleaved Spike (S) protein molecules could be released into the bloodstream from the leaking pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier in patients with severe COVID-19, opening to the possibility of non-infective diseases in organs distant from the primary site of infection. PURPOSES: (1) to confirm that human primary cardiac PC express ACE2 and CD147; (2) to verify if PC are permissible to SARS-CoV-2 infection; (3) to investigate if the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein alone, without the other viral elements, can trigger molecular signalling and induce functional alterations in PC; (4) to explore which viral receptor is responsible for the observed events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac PC express both the ACE2 and CD147 receptors at mRNA and protein level. Incubation of PC for up to 5 days with SARS-CoV-2 expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) did not show any evidence of cell infection or viral replication. Next, we exposed the PC to the recombinant S protein (5.8 nM) and confirmed that the protein engaged with cellular receptors (western blot analysis of S protein in treated and control PC). Incubation with the S protein increased PC migration (wound closure assay, P<0.01 vs ctrl) and reduced the formation of tubular structures between PC and EC in a Matrigel assay (P<0.01 vs ctrl). Moreover, the S protein promoted the production of pro-inflammatory factors typical of the cytokine storm in PC (ELISA measurement of MCP1, IL-6, IL-1, TNF, P<0.05 vs ctrl), and induced the secretion of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death (Caspase 3/7 assay, P<0.05 vs ctrl). Signalling studies revealed that the S protein triggers the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PC. The neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented ERK1/2 activation in PC, and was reflected into a partial rescue of the cell functional behaviour (migration and pro-angiogenic capacity). In contrast, blockage of CD147 failed to prevent the pro-inflammatory response in PC. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the novel hypothesis that COVID-19 associated heart's microvascular dysfunction is prompted by circulating S protein molecules rather than by the direct coronavirus infection of PC. Besides, we propose CD147, and not ACE2, as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac PC. FUNDUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: Type of funding sources: Foundation.

The interaction between real-time social media use patterns and clinical anxiety during infectious disease outbreaks is underexplored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usage pattern of 2 types of social media apps (communication and social networking) among patients in outpatient psychiatric treatment during the COVID-19 surge and lockdown in Madrid, Spain and their short-term anxiety symptoms (7-item General Anxiety Disorder scale) at clinical follow-up. METHODS: The individual-level shifts in median social media usage behavior from February 1 through May 3, 2020 were summarized using repeated measures analysis of variance that accounted for the fixed effects of the lockdown (prelockdown versus postlockdown), group (clinical anxiety group versus nonclinical anxiety group), the interaction of lockdown and group, and random effects of users. A machine learningCbased approach that combined a hidden Markov model and logistic regression was applied to predict clinical anxiety (n=44) and nonclinical anxiety (n=51), based on longitudinal time-series data that comprised communication and social networking app usage (in seconds) as well as anxiety-associated clinical survey variables, including the presence of an essential worker in the household, worries about life instability, changes in social interaction frequency during the lockdown, cohabitation status, and health status. RESULTS: Individual-level analysis of daily social media usage showed that the increase in communication app usage from prelockdown to lockdown period was significantly smaller in the clinical anxiety group than that in the nonclinical anxiety group (F(1,72)=3.84, P=.05). The machine learning model achieved a mean accuracy of 62.30% (SD 16%) and area under the receiver operating curve 0.70 (SD 0.19) in 10-fold cross-validation in identifying the clinical anxiety group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who reported severe anxiety symptoms were less active in communication apps after the mandated lockdown and more engaged in social networking apps in the overall period, which suggested that there was a different pattern of digital social behavior for adapting to the crisis.

Animal models help to understand the complex interplay between the different cell types of the CNS and uncover general mechanisms of damage and repair of myelin sheaths. The so called cuprizone model is a toxic model of demyelination in the CNS white and gray matter, which lacks an autoimmune component. Cuprizone induces apoptosis of mature oligodendrocytes that leads to a robust demyelination and profound activation of both astrocytes and microglia with regional heterogeneity between different white and gray matter regions. Although not suitable to study autoimmune mediated demyelination, this model is extremely helpful to elucidate basic cellular and molecular mechanisms during de- and particularly remyelination independently of interactions with peripheral immune cells. Phagocytosis and removal of damaged myelin seems to be one of the major roles of microglia in this model and it is well known that removal of myelin debris is a prerequisite of successful remyelination. Furthermore, microglia provide several signals that support remyelination. The role of astrocytes during de- and remyelination is not well defined.

In this study, we used an innovative agent-based model to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the prevalence and severity of low back pain in the general population. METHODS: Epidemiological data were used to simulate the low back pain evolution in a population of 300,000 agents. Reduced access to treatment due to the containment measures was simulated with a probabilistic approach, in which 500 random scenarios (differing in: length of the lockdown, probability of having access to treatment, time before the resumption of treatment, duration of the effects of the treatment after its interruption) were simulated. RESULTS: The lockdown may increase the mean pain score higher than 1/10 points for patients suffering from acute low back pain, up to 4C5/10 points for specific individuals. The lockdown also affected the length of pain episodes, possibly impacting chronicity and disability. All the variables describing the random scenarios had a relevant impact in determining both the increase of pain intensity in the population and the length of the effects of the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal lockdown parameters which minimize the impact on low back pain while preserving the effects on infection spread and mortality could not be identified.

In this study, three novel aromatic soybean cultivars with a fragrant volatile compound were isolated. We confirmed that the aroma of these cultivars is due to the potent volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) that was previously identified in soybean. A sequence comparison of GmBADH1/2 (encoding an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase) between aromatic and non-aromatic soybean varieties revealed a mutation with 10 SNPs and an 11-nucleotide deletion in exon 1 of GmBADH2 in Quxian No. 1 and Xiangdou. Additionally, a 2-bp deletion was detected in exon 10 of GmBADH2 in ZK1754. The mutations resulted in a frame shift and the introduction of premature stop codons. Moreover, genetic analyses indicated that the aromatic trait in these three varieties was inherited according to a single recessive gene model. These results suggested that a mutated GmBADH2 may be responsible for the aroma of these three aromatic soybean cultivars. The expression and function of GmBADH2 in aromatic soybean seeds were confirmed by qRT-PCR and CRISPR/Cas9. A functional marker developed on the basis of the mutated GmBADH2 sequence in Quxian No. 1 and Xiangdou was validated in an F2 population.

The systematic identification of substrates is thus crucial to characterise the functions of kinases and determine the pathways they regulate, and even more so when studying the impact of pathogens-excreted kinases on the host cell signal transduction. Several strategies and approaches have been used to identify substrates, but all show important limitations thus calling for the development of new efficient and more convenient approaches for kinase substrate identification.

We developed SILAkin using the Leishmania casein kinase 1 (L-CK1.2) as experimental model. Leishmania, an intracellular parasite causing Leishmaniasis, releases L-CK1.2 in its host cell. Applying this novel assay allowed us to gain unprecedented insight into host-pathogen interactions through the identification of host substrates phosphorylated by pathogen-excreted kinases. We identified 225 substrates, including 85% previously unknown that represent novel mammalian CK1 targets, and defined a novel CK1 phosphorylation motif. The substratome was validated experimentally by L-CK1.2 and human CK1, demonstrating the efficiency of SILAkin to identify new substrates and revealing novel regulatory pathways. Finally, SILAkin was instrumental in highlighting host pathways potentially regulated by L-CK1.2 in Leishmania-infected host cells, described by the GO terms viral & symbiotic interaction, apoptosis, actin cytoskeleton organisation, and RNA processing and splicing. SILAkin thus can generate important mechanistic insights into the signalling of host subversion by these parasites and other microbial pathogen adapted for intracellular survival.","output":"SILAKin: A novel high throughput SILAC and mass spectrometry-based assay to identify the substratome of kinases secreted by pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in hospitalization and death in older patients and those with underlying comorbidities. Sotrovimab is a pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody designed to treat such high-risk patients early in the course of disease, thereby preventing Covid-19 progression. Methods: In this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for disease progression were randomized (1:1) to an intravenous infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with Covid-19 progression, defined as hospitalization longer than 24 hours or death, through day 29. Results: In this preplanned interim analysis, which included an intent-to-treat population of 583 patients (sotrovimab, 291; placebo, 292), the primary efficacy endpoint was met. The risk of Covid-19 progression was significantly reduced by 85% (97.24% confidence interval, 44% to 96%; P = 0.002) with a total of three (1%) patients progressing to the primary endpoint in the sotrovimab group versus 21 (7%) patients in the placebo group. All five patients admitted to intensive care, including one who died by day 29, received placebo. Safety was assessed in 868 patients (sotrovimab, 430; placebo, 438). Adverse events were reported by 17% and 19% of patients receiving sotrovimab and placebo, respectively; serious adverse events were less common with sotrovimab (2%) versus placebo (6%). Conclusion: Sotrovimab reduced progression of Covid-19 in patients with mild/moderate disease, was well tolerated, and no safety signals were identified.

The social isolation after the lock-down has not only led to economic difficulties, but also adverse psychological reactions. As in most countries, also in Poland the situation was very challenging for T1DM patients. In this case a crisis intervention team for T1 DM patients was established. The goal of the team was to provide psychological support for the patients if needed and to present information concerning how the patients may obtain medical consultations/prescriptions. OBJECTIVE: Analysis of psychological parameters and main emotional reactions of T1DM patients during Covid-19 lock-down. METHODS: An email with information concerning the possibility of online consultation with psychologists/psychiatrist, with an attached set of psychological tests was sent to all patients with T1DM who were under the care of outpatient diabetes clinic. The consultations were done by licensed clinical psychologist and psychologist. The study was approved by the bioethics committee. RESULTS: The patients who decided to use psychological support had statistically higher level of anxiety and stress that patients from the group who did not seek for support. CONCLUSIONS: The presented intervention team may be perceived as an example of an important and successful cooperation and communication between specialists of different fields of medicine (diabetology, psychiatry and psychology) in a moment of crisis situation.","output":"Covid-19 lock down stress and type 1 diabetes mellitus - analysis of crisis psychological intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Delivery of psychological therapies via telehealth has increased with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: It is important to consider perceived and real safety; practical and technological issues; therapeutic alliance; depth of emotional processing; and dissociation. SUMMARY: There was support for the delivery of imagery rescripting via telehealth being no less effective than face-to-face delivery; however, telehealth delivery was not a viable option for many clients during COVID-19 lockdowns who were living in high density housing, old houses with thin walls, or with some complex disorders.","output":"Delivering Imagery Rescripting via Telehealth: Clinical Concerns, Benefits, and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Little is known about how early (e.g., commencing antenatally or in the first 12 months after birth) obesity prevention interventions seek to change behaviour and which components are or are not effective. This study aims to 1) characterise early obesity prevention interventions in terms of target behaviours, delivery features, and behaviour change techniques (BCTs), 2) explore similarities and differences in BCTs used to target behaviours, and 3) explore effectiveness of intervention components in preventing childhood obesity. Methods and analysis: Annual comprehensive systematic searches will be performed in Epub Ahead of Print/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane (CENTRAL), CINAHL, PsycINFO, as well as clinical trial registries. Eligible randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventions to prevent childhood obesity commencing antenatally or in the first year after birth will be invited to join the TOPCHILD Collaboration. Standard ontologies will be used to code target behaviours, delivery features and BCTs in both published and unpublished intervention materials provided by trialists. Narrative syntheses will be performed to summarise intervention components and compare applied BCTs by types of target behaviours. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to assess effectiveness of intervention components. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (project no. 2020/273) and Flinders University Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee (project no. HREC CIA2133-1). The studys findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and targeted communication with key stakeholders. Discussion: Our study will provide an in depth understanding of behavioural components and delivery features used in obesity prevention interventions starting antenatally or in the first 12 months after birth. Understanding common intervention approaches in a systematic way will provide much needed insight to advance the design of early obesity prevention interventions and provide the opportunity to undertake future quantitative predictive modelling.

Briefly, recreancy is loss of societal trust that results when institutional actors can no longer be counted on to perform their responsibilities. Our study of mental well-being and recreancy focuses on the role of universities and government regulators within the education sector. We surveyed 600 UK students attending 161 different public higher education providers in October 2020 during a time when many UK students were isolated in their residences and engaged in online learning. We assessed student well-being using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (scored 7-35) and found the mean score to be 19.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.6, 20.2]. This level of well-being indicates that a significant proportion of UK students face low levels of mental well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicates that high recreancy-measured as a low trust in universities and the government-is associated with low levels of mental well-being across the student sample. While these findings are suggestive, they are also important and we suggest that government and university leaders should not only work to increase food and housing security during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also consider how to combat various sector trends that might intensify recreancy.","output":"Mental Well-Being in UK Higher Education During Covid-19: Do Students Trust Universities and the Government?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has become the most relevant medical issue globally Despite several studies that have investigated clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, no data have been reported on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) Since VFs may influence cardiorespiratory function and disease outcomes, the aim of this study was to assess VFs prevalence and clinical impact in COVID-19 DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at San Raffaele Hospital, a tertiary health care hospital in Italy We included COVID-19 patients for whom lateral chest x-rays at emergency department were available VFs were detected using a semiquantitative evaluation of vertebral shape on chest x-rays RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in this study and thoracic VFs were detected in 41 patients (36%) Patients with VFs were older and more frequently affected by hypertension and coronary artery disease (P &lt; 0 001, P = 0 007, P = 0 034;respectively) Thirty-six (88%) patients in VFs+ group compared to 54 (74%) in VFs- group were hospitalized (P = 0 08) Patients with VFs more frequently required noninvasive mechanical ventilation compared with those without VFs (P = 0 02) Mortality was 22% in VFs+ group and 10% in VFs- group (P = 0 07) In particular, mortality was higher in patients with severe VFs compared with those with moderate and mild VFs (P = 0 04) CONCLUSIONS: VFs may integrate the cardiorespiratory risk of COVID-19 patients, being a useful and easy to measure clinical marker of fragility and poor prognosis We suggest that morphometric thoracic vertebral evaluation should be performed in all suspected COVID-19 patients undergoing chest x-rays","output":"Radiological Thoracic Vertebral Fractures are Highly Prevalent in COVID-19 and Predict Disease Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Communaut d'Agglomration Centre Littoral (CACL) in French Guiana is characterized by a high concentration of health and social services, especially in the Cayenne Island.

METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2020. The present study compared internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. RevMan5.3 software provided by the International Cochrane Group was used for the meta-analysis. To compare the differences in the operation time, intraoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay, superficial infection, Harris hip score, mortality within 1 year, mortality within 2 years, reoperation, incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), partial weight-bearing time, non-union, and implant-related complications between an internal fixation group and an hemiarthroplasty group. RESULTS: A total of 1300 patients were included in nine studies. The results showed that the operation time (MD = -18.09, 95% CI: -27.85--8.34, P = 0.0003), intraoperative bleeding (MD = -195.31, 95% CI: -244.8--147.74, P < 0.0001), implant-related complications (MD = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.74-8.45, P = 0.0008), and partial weight-bearing time (MD = 17.21, 95% CI: 1.63-32.79, P = 0.03) have statistical significance. However, there is not statistical significance for the Harris hip joint function scale (HHS) (MD = 5.60, 95% CI: -1.13-12.33, P = 0.10), DVT (MD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.45-2.27, P = 0.97), length of hospital stay (MD = -1.08, 95% CI: -2.82-0.66, P = 0.22), superficial Infection (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.43-1.98, P = 0.89), mortality within 1 year (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.48, P = 0.81), mortality within 2 years (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.61-1.43, P = 0.75), reoperation (MD = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.64-5.04, P = 0.26), and non-union (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.48-3.03, P = 0.70). The result of the subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between the less than 2 years follow-up and the 2 years or more follow-up group. The only difference was for the Harris hip score: the internal fixation group was superior to the hemiarthroplasty group in the less than 2 years subgroup analysis, while there was no difference between the internal fixation group hemiarthroplasty group in the 2 years or more subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: Compared with the internal fixation group, those in the hemiarthroplasty group could carry out weight-bearing training early and implant-related complications were reduced, but it requires longer operation time and there is greater intraoperative blood loss. There is no difference in mortality, the incidence of DVT, non-union, HHS, reoperation, length of hospital stay, and superficial infection.

We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28, 2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly, the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising: during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of public health and medical research to factor in.","output":"Towards Understanding the COVID-19 Case Fatality Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There is no artificial intelligence (AI) without people. People design and develop AI; they modify and use it and they have to reorganize the ways they have carried out tasks in their work and everyday life. National strategies are documents made to describe how different nations foster AI and as human dimensions are such an important aspect of AI, this study sought to investigate major national strategy documents to determine how they view the human role in emerging AI societies. APPROACH: Our method for analyzing the strategies was conceptual analysis since the development of technology is embedded with conceptual ideas of humanity, explicit or implicit, and in addition to deepening analysis of explicit argumentation the method enables the deconstruction and reconstruction of meanings and conceptual relations within the strategies, exposing presumptions and tacit commitments of the writers. FINDINGS: The analysis of the documents illustrates that the general tendency in national strategies is globally dominantly technology-driven as the state of affairs appears to be creating new technologies. However, various human research points such as usability, user experience, sociotechnical and life-based themes are less well represented. Because national strategies are used to develop innovation processes, we argue that future development of national strategies could be improved by taking human research issues more energetically in the agenda.

We manipulated dyads awareness of death [MT vs neutral control (NC)] and simultaneously measured their neurophysiological activity using electroencephalography during the task. Several fundamental observations were made. First, the MT group showed significantly attenuated competition and slightly promoted cooperation. Second, compared to NC, MT significantly decreased gamma-band inter-brain synchronization (IBS) in the competitive context, which was associated with increased subjective fear of death within dyads. Notably, those effects were context-specific: we did not observe comparable results in the cooperative context. Finally, a machine-learning approach was successfully used to discriminate between the MT and NC groups based on accumulated IBS.

Predictors of influenza virus infection during the influenza season have previously been evaluated in adult studies of the antiviral agent zanamivir; cough and temperature > or =37.8 degrees C predicted influenza virus positivity in 79% of those evaluated. METHODS Fever and other respiratory symptoms were examined to determine their value in predicting influenza virus-positive status in children. Data analyzed were from a clinical trial of zanamivir in children 5-12 years of age and from a trial of oseltamivir in children 1-12 years of age. RESULTS In the pediatric study of zanamivir, as in the adult zanamivir study, cough and fever were the best predictors of influenza virus infection; a temperature > or =38.2 degrees C plus cough predicted 83% (95% CI, 79%-88%) of illnesses that were determined to be influenza virus positive. Cough (positive predictive value, 70%; 95% CI, 64%-75%), but not fever, was the best predictor of influenza virus-positive status in children aged 5-12 years in the oseltamivir trials, but neither cough nor fever were successful predictors in young children 1-4 years of age. The latter findings appeared to be the result of less symptomatic diversity among patients recruited for this trial, such that subjects who were determined to be influenza virus positive and subjects who were influenza virus negative had similar symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The results of these studies suggest that, during the influenza season, symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection are applicable to identification of cases in children, although confirmation of predictive values in subjects 1-4 years of age may require further study of additional signs/symptoms.","output":"Symptomatic predictors of influenza virus positivity in children during the influenza season."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to healthcare services in the world It has negatively impacted surgical practice, and health workers We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical practice in the Kurdistan Region, Iraq Methods An online cross-sectional study using an online survey was performed between 13 April to 29 April, 2020 in the Kurdistan Region, Iraq An online cross-sectional study using an online survey was performed between 13 April to 29 April, 2020 in the Kurdistan Region, Iraq A total of 241 surgeons, aged 28C70 years (mean range 22 2  7 9 SD), were recruited to this study The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons practices Participants completed a self-developed online questionnaire Results The majority of participants (44 39%) were general surgeons, followed by urologists (17 01%) Approximately 82 57% of surgeons performed surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic and 60 31% undertook emergency surgeries only There was no significant difference between men and women (P=0 41) and different age groups (P=0 08) Only 28 22% of surgeons had access to full personal protective equipment (PPE), and 41 18% believed that wearing PPEs severely affected their skills Results also found that surgeons aged between 28C34 years were more pledged to the use of PPEs, than other age groups (P=0 001) The use of PPEs during surgeries was significantly higher in the Sulaymaniyah province (P=0 001) The surgical services were also severely impacted in the Sulaymaniyah province than in the other provinces (p=0 001) Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected surgical practice in the Kurdistan Region, particularly in the Sulaymaniyah province Males, and young surgeons showed a higher commitment level for using PPE Additional training and precautions are needed to increase awareness about COVID-19 among surgeons, and the importance of using PPE during surgery","output":"Impact Of Covid-19 Pandemic On Surgical Practice In Kurdistan, Iraq: An Online Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has been associated with a variety of prothrombotic sequelae The pathogenesis of this hypercoagulability has not yet been fully elucidated, but it is thought to be multifactorial with overactivation of the complement pathways playing a central role There is emerging evidence that the resulting complications are not confined to the venous circulation, and even in patients without typical respiratory symptoms or traditional risk factors, there is a significant rate of arterial thromboembolic disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection CASE REPORT: We describe a patient presenting with bilateral leg pain without any respiratory symptoms or fever who ultimately was found to be COVID-19 positive and had thromboembolism of the aorta and bilateral iliac occlusion This report reviews available evidence on the prevalence of arterial thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients and some proposed mechanisms of the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy CONCLUSION: It is important that the emergency physician maintain a high degree of suspicion for arterial thromboembolic disease in patients who are infected with COVID-19 even in the absence of typical respiratory symptoms Additionally, COVID-19 should be considered in patients with unexplained thromboembolic disease, as this may increase the detection of COVID-19","output":"Case Report of Thrombosis of the Distal Aorta with Occlusion of Iliac Arteries in COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alternatives to conventional hospitalization are needed to increase health systems resilience in the face of COVID-19 pandemic.

Here I discuss endothelial-epithelial co-operative in vivo responses producing first-line, humoral innate defence opportunities in human airways. The pseudostratified epithelium of human nasal and tracheobronchial airways are prime sites of exposure and infection by SARS-CoV-2. Just beneath the epithelium runs a profuse systemic microcirculation. Its post-capillary venules respond conspicuously to mucosal challenges with autacoids, allergens and microbes, and to mere loss of epithelium. By active venular endothelial gap formation, followed by transient yielding of epithelial junctions, non-sieved plasma macromolecules move from the microcirculation to the mucosal surface. Hence, plasma-derived protein cascade systems and antimicrobial peptides would have opportunity to operate jointly on an unperturbed mucosal lining. Similarly, a plasma-derived, dynamic gel protects sites of epithelial sloughing-regeneration. Precision for this indiscriminate humoral molecular response lies in restricted location and well-regulated duration of plasma exudation. Importantly, the endothelial responsiveness of the airway microcirculation differs distinctly from the relatively non-responsive, low-pressure pulmonary microcirculation that non-specifically, almost irreversibly, leaks plasma in life-threatening COVID-19. Observations in humans of infections with rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, and influenza A and B support a general but individually variable early occurrence of plasma exudation in human infected nasal and tracheobronchial airways. Investigations are warranted to elucidate roles of host- and drug-induced airway plasma exudation in restriction of viral infection and, specifically, whether it contributes to variable disease responses following exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Early humoral defence: Contributing to confining COVID-19 to conducting airways?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stretched our healthcare system to the brink, highlighting the importance of efficient resource utilization without compromising healthcare provider safety. While advanced imaging is a great resource for diagnostic purposes, the risk of contamination and infection transmission is high and requires extensive logistical planning for intrahospital patient transport, healthcare provider safety, and post-imaging decontamination. This dilemma has necessitated the transition to more bedside imaging. More so than ever, during the current pandemic, the clinical utility and importance of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) cannot be overstressed. It allows for safe and efficient beside procedural guidance and provides front line providers with valuable diagnostic information that can be acted upon in real-time for immediate clinical decision-making.

Effective prevention is available through HPV vaccination and emerging evidence demonstrates the potential to significantly impact HPV-associated disease through reductions in the incidence of genital warts, precancerous cervical lesions, and cervical cancer. Indications have also recently expanded to include the prevention of oropharyngeal cancer, an outcome that has been increasing in incidence for men and women. Yet despite demonstrated effectiveness, the potential for broader impact and well-established routine recommendations for administration to adolescents, barriers to vaccine uptake persist. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on HPV prevention in the US, including trends in disease burden, HPV vaccine effectiveness, evolving vaccine recommendations and opportunities and barriers to their implementation. RECENT FINDINGS Several studies have demonstrated that HPV vaccination has the potential to prevent most HPV-attributable cancers. Ongoing research addresses questions related to duration of protection, effectiveness in vulnerable populations, vaccine schedules and strategies to improve access and optimize uptake. SUMMARY To ensure continued impact on the prevention of HPV-associated disease and subsequent cancer, it is crucial to address gaps in vaccine uptake. A strong recommendation for all persons for whom HPV vaccines are indicated, alongside initiatives to increase awareness of HPV vaccination and address specific concerns, can improve uptake among hesitant populations. Globally, efforts to bolster immunization programs are needed to broaden access to HPV vaccination.","output":"Human papillomavirus: optimizing opportunities for prevention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have repeatedly restricted public life to control the contagion However, the health impact of confinement measures is hitherto unclear We performed a multinational survey investigating changes in mental and physical well-being (MWB/PWB) during the first wave of the pandemic A total of 14,975 individuals from 14 countries provided valid responses Compared to pre-restrictions, MWB, as measured by the WHO-5 questionnaire, decreased considerably during restrictions (68 1 +/- 16 9 to 51 9 +/- 21 0 points) Whereas 14 2% of the participants met the cutoff for depression screening pre-restrictions, this share tripled to 45 2% during restrictions Factors associated with clinically relevant decreases in MWB were female sex (odds ratio/OR = 1 20, 95% CI: 1 11-1 29), high physical activity levels pre-restrictions (OR = 1 29, 95% CI 1 16-1 42), decreased vigorous physical activity during restrictions (OR = 1 14, 95% CI: 1 05-1 23), and working (partially) outside the home vs working remotely (OR = 1 29, 95% CI: 1 16-1 44/OR = 1 35, 95% CI: 1 23-1 47) Reductions, although smaller, were also seen for PWB Scores in the SF-36 bodily pain subscale decreased from 85 8 +/- 18 7% pre-restrictions to 81 3 +/- 21 9% during restrictions Clinically relevant decrements of PWB were associated with female sex (OR = 1 62, 95% CI: 1 50-1 75), high levels of public life restrictions (OR = 1 26, 95% CI: 1 18-1 36), and young age (OR = 1 10, 95% CI: 1 03-1 19) Study findings suggest lockdowns instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had substantial adverse public health effects The development of interventions mitigating losses in MWB and PWB is, thus, paramount when preparing for forthcoming waves of COVID-19 or future public life restrictions","output":"Drastic Reductions in Mental Well-Being Observed Globally During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results From the ASAP Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel series of peptidomimetic aldehydes was designed and synthesized to target 3C protease (3Cpro) of enterovirus 71 (EV71).

Amidst a pandemic, the process of implementing new treatment approaches can be particularly challenging in larger institutions with multiple treatment centers. We describe the implementation of single-fraction (SF) lung stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in a multicenter provincial cancer program. Materials and Methods British Columbia, Canada has a provincial cancer program with six geographically distributed radiotherapy centers serving a population of 5.1 million, over 944,735 square kilometers. In March 2020, provincial mitigation strategies were developed in case of reduced access to radiotherapy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF lung SABR was identified by the provincial lung radiation oncology group as a mitigation measure supported by high-quality randomized evidence that could provide comparable outcomes and toxicity to existing fractionated SABR protocols. A working group consisting of radiation oncologists and medical physicists reviewed the medical literature and drafted consensus guidelines that were reviewed by a group of center representatives as a component of provincial lung radiotherapy mitigation strategic planning. Individual centers were encouraged to implement SF lung SABR as their resources and staffing would allow. Centers were then surveyed about barriers to implementation. Results On March 24, 2020, a working group was created and consensus guidelines for SF lung SABR were drafted. The final version was approved and distributed by the working group on March 26, 2020. The provincial lung radiotherapy mitigation strategy group adopted the guidelines for implementation on April 1, 2020. Implementation was completed at the first center on April 27, 2020. Barriers to implementation were identified at five of six centers. Two centers in regions with disproportionately high COVID-19 cases described inadequate staffing as a barrier to implementation. One center encountered delays due to pre-scheduled commissioning of new treatment techniques. Three centers cited competing priorities as reasons for delay. As of May 2021, two centers had active SF lung SABR programs in place, three centers were in the process of implementation, and one center had no immediate plans for implementation due to ongoing resource issues. Conclusion SF lung SABR was adopted by a provincial cancer program within weeks of conception through rapid communication during the development of COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies for radiotherapy. Although consensus guidelines were written and approved in an expedited timeframe, the completion of implementation by individual centers was variable due to differences in resource allocation and staffing among the centers. Strong organizational structures and early identification of potential barriers may improve the efficiency of implementing new treatment initiatives in large multicenter radiotherapy programs.","output":"Implementation of Single-Fraction Lung Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in a Multicenter Provincial Cancer Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of the 2020 Sars-CoV-2 Italian outbreak, healthcare workers have been among the most exposed categories. There is little information about community pharmacists' on occupational exposure, symptoms development, and testing practices in the community pharmacist cohort. METHODS: Between April 30th and May 10th, a questionnaire was administered through social media to Italian community pharmacists. From 67000 pharmacists currently working in community pharmacies, 1632 answered the survey. RESULTS: The survey population reflected the general Italian community pharmacists population in terms of age, gender, and number of co-workers. Protective measures were adopted in up to 99.9% of pharmacies. 624 pharmacists (38.2%) developed at least one COVID-19 related symptom in the period between February 28th and May 10th. Also, 102 pharmacists (6.2%) were tested for COVID-19 and 15, the 15% of the tested population and 0.92% of the whole survey population, resulted positive on nasopharyngeal swab. However, while the number of symptomatic pharmacists decreased, a higher number of tests were performed, thus COVID-19 prevalence among community pharmacists could have been underestimated and is probably intermediate between other healthcare workers and the general population (0.31%). CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists have probably been one of the first categories to experience increased contact risk to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 prevalence among pharmacists could have been underestimated.

These findings are relevant because of the high prevalence of CU in this EPP, and the potential for prevention during this phase of illness. However, there is still a lack of clear explanations, supported by empirical evidence, about what underlies the link between CU and VB against other. Method: This viewpoint reviews the scientific literature on the link between CU and VB, and the involvement of impulsivity in this relationship. This last point will be addressed at clinical and neurobiological levels. Results: Recent studies confirmed that CU is particularly high in the EPP, and is a risk factor for VB in the EPP and schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that impulsivity is a risk factor for VB in psychosis, is associated with CU, and may mediate the link between CU and VB. Research suggests a neurobiological mechanism, as CU affects the structures and function of frontal areas, known to play a role in impulsive behavior. Conclusion: Scientific evidence support the hypothesis of an involvement of impulsivity as a variable that could mediate the link between CU and aggression, particularly, when CU has an early onset. However, this hypothesis should be confirmed with longitudinal studies and by taking into account confounding factors. The studies highlight the relevance of early prevention in the EPP, in addition to interventions focusing on psychotic disorders.","output":"The Link Between Cannabis Use and Violent Behavior in the Early Phase of Psychosis: The Potential Role of Impulsivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the emergence of various highly contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2, vaccine boosters were adopted as a complementary strategy in different countries.

We evaluated a candidate A/Anhui/2013(H7N9) pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccine (pLAIV) in healthy adults, and assessed the ability of 1 or 2 doses to induce immune memory. Methods. Healthy subjects in 2 age groups (18C49 years and 50C70 years) with undetectable hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody to H7N9 were enrolled. Younger subjects received either 1 or 2 intranasal doses of 10(7.0) fluorescent focus units of A/Anhui/1/2013 pLAIV, while older subjects received a single dose. All subjects received a single 30-g dose of unadjuvanted, antigenically matched A/Shanghai2/2013(H7N9) pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine (pIIV) 12 weeks after their first dose of pLAIV. Results. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Serum HAI antibody responses were detected in 0 of 32 younger subjects and 1 of 17 older subjects after 1 dose of pLAIV and in 2 of 16 younger subjects after a second dose. Strong serum antibody responses were detected after a single subsequent dose of pIIV that was broadly reactive against H7 influenza viruses. Conclusions. An A(H7N9) pLAIV candidate was safe in both age groups. Priming with pLAIV resulted in responses to subsequent pIIV that exceeded those seen in naive subjects in previous reports. The A(H7N9) pLAIV induces strong immune memory that can be demonstrated by exposure to subsequent antigenic challenge. Clinical Trials Registration.

We aimed to examine the incidence of limb amputation among sepsis survivors, and to investigate factors independently associated with limb amputation. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, data obtained from the South Korean national health insurance service database between 2015 and 2016 were analyzed. A sepsis survivor was defined as someone having survived > 90 days after initiation of treatment for sepsis. RESULTS: Of 19,906 sepsis survivors, 163 (0.8%) had undergone surgical limb amputation. In a multivariable model, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26C2.40; P = 0.001), dopamine infusion (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.22C2.60; P = 0.003), epinephrine infusion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.30C3.20; P = 0.002), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.01C3.20; P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (DM) without chronic complication (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19C2.51; P = 0.004), DM with chronic complication (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.32C5.26; P < 0.001), and peripheral arterial disease (OR 6.79, 95% CO 3.70C12.46; P < 0.001) were associated with a higher incidence of limb amputation among sepsis survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In South Korea, 0.8% of sepsis survivors underwent limb amputation for the treatment of PG.

While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono- and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host.

Despite the importance of coronavirus infections in these animals, there are no effective commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these infections. We have previously reported the efficacy of a protease inhibitor in cats with FIP, demonstrating that a virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a valid target for antiviral drug development for coronavirus infections. In this study, we extended our previous work on coronavirus inhibitors and investigated the structure-activity relationships of a focused library of protease inhibitors for ferret and mink 3CLpro. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we identified potent inhibitors broadly effective against feline, ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpro. Multiple amino acid sequence analysis and modelling of 3CLpro of ferret and mink coronaviruses were conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings.

Because both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher in the ASV group, an EF  45% in combination with AHI 15/h, central apnoea-hyponoea index [CAHI/AHI] > 50% and central apnoea index [CAI] > 10/h were subsequently listed as contraindications for ASV. The intention of our study was to analyse the clinical relevance of this limitation. METHODS: Data were analysed retrospectively for patients treated with ASV who received follow-up echocardiography to identify contraindications for ASV. RESULTS: Echocardiography was conducted in 23 patients. The echocardiogram was normal in 10 cases, a left ventricular hypertrophy with normal EF was found in 8 patients, there was an EF 45C50% in 2 cases and a valvular aortic stenosis (grade II) with normal EF was found in 1 case. EF <45% was present in just 2 cases, and only 1 of these patients also had more than 50% central events in the diagnostic night. CONCLUSION: The population typically treated with ASV is entirely different from the study population in SERVE-HF, as nearly half of the patients treated with ASV showed a normal echocardiogram. Thus, the modified indication for ASV has little impact on the majority of treated patients.

The objective of the study is to conduct the first RCT in Germany that addresses a broad group of long-term unemployed individuals with severe mental illnesses that receive means-tested benefits, and to test the effectiveness of the IPS intervention. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, about 120 eligible participants aged between 18 years and local retirement age will be randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) or to an active control group (CG) using a parallel arm design. The IG will receive IPS + high quality treatment as usual (TAU), the active CG will receive TAU + a booklet on integration measures. A block-randomization algorithm with a targeted assignment ratio of 1:1 for participants in IG and active CG will be used, stratified by sex and three age groups. Assessments will take place before the intervention at baseline (t0), and 6 (t1), 12 (t2), and 18 (t3) months later.

This retrospective study aimed to present the pattern of time-to-surgery (TTS) and analyze the features of breast cancer patients under the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Patients who received surgeries for breast cancers at West China Hospital between February 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020 (the outbreak and post-peak stages), and between March 10, 2021 and May 25, 2021 (the normalization stage) were included. TTS was calculated as the time interval between the pathological diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer patients. And the pandemic was divided into three stages based on the time when the patients were pathologically diagnosed and the severity of pandemic at that time point. TTS, demographic and clinicopathological features were collected from medical records. Results A total of 367 patients were included. As for demographic features, it demonstrated statistically significant differences in insurance type (p<0.001) and regular screening (p<0.001), as well as age (p=0.013) and menstrual status (p=0.004). As for clinicopathological features, axillary involvement (p=0.019) was a factor that differed among three stages. The overall TTS was 23.56  21.39 days. TTS for patients who were diagnosed during the outbreak of COVID-19 were longer than those diagnosed during pandemic post-peak and normalization stage (p<0.001). Pandemic stage (p<0.001) and excision biopsy before surgery (OR, 6.459;95% CI, 2.225-18.755;p=0.001) were markedly correlated with the TTS of patients. Conclusions TTS of breast cancer patients significantly varied in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. And breast cancer patients daily lives and disease treatments were affected by the pandemic in many aspects, such as health insurance access, physical screening and change of therapeutic schedules. As the time-delay may cause negative influences on patients disease, we should minimize the occurrence of such time-delay.

Study Eligibility Criteria: Studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values and clinical outcomes in adult and pediatric populations were included. Animal studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and non-English language studies were excluded. Participants: Humans infected with gastrointestinal pathogens, detected with qPCR. Interventions: Diagnostics assessing Ct values. Extracted data were reported narratively. Results: Thirty-three eligible studies were identified; the most commonly studied pathogens were Clostridioides difficile (n = 15), norovirus (n = 10), and rotavirus (n = 9). Statistically significant associations between low C. difficile Ct values and increased symptom severity or poor outcome were reported in 4/8 (50%) studies, and increased risk of death in 1/2 (50%) studies; no significant associations were found between Ct value and duration of symptoms or length of hospital stay.

The impact of lockdown measures on particle number size distributions were also quite limited. During the lockdown period, the number concentrations of 10C25 and 25C50 nm primary particles were reduced by 66% and 34%, respectively, at the regional background site (Ispra) but surprisingly there was no difference during and after lockdown at the urban background site (Modena).

This study records the label-free electrical detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the gate-all-around junctionless field effect transistor (GAA-JLFET) that detects the virus because of the electrical properties (dielectric constant and charge) of spike protein, envelope protein, and virus DNA, for a highly sensitive and real-time bio-sensor. GAA-JLFETs are suitable for this application because of their highest gate controllability, potential vertical stacking, current industry trend compatibility, inherent ease of fabrication, and higher sensitivity. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is first immobilized in the etched nano-cavity embedded beneath the gate electrode, which is then used to detect it. The SARS-CoV-2 virus detection has been calibrated based on the change in system electrical properties after virus immobilization. For effective virus detection, the work takes into account both the dielectric property of S protein and the charge of DNA at the same time. The sensitivity has been calculated using VTH, ION, gm, and SS. The simulation analysis also shows a simpler recovery mechanism in this case. The present work investigates the label-free electrical detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using GAA-JLFET that detects the spike protein, envelope protein, and virus DNA, for a highly sensitive and real-time bio-sensor.","output":"Gate-all-around junctionless FET based label-free dielectric/charge modulation detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus? ?

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan, Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19.

METHODS: This study was conducted in 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease. Information of 21 nonsurvivor and 358 survivor patients with COVID-19 was obtained from the hospital information management system and analyzed retrospectively. Relationship between cardiac parameters in patients categorized into the mortal and immortal groups was investigated. RESULTS: Of the total 379 patients involved in this study, 155 (40.9%) were females and 224 (59.1%) were males. No statistically significant difference in mortality was found between females and males (p=0.249). The total median age was 70, the median age in the nonsurvivor group was 74 (35-89), and it was 69.5 (18-96) in the survivor group (p=0.249). The median values of high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn), creatine kinase MB form, and especially myoglobin in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups were 25/64.9 (p=0.028), 18/23 (p=0.02), and 105.5/322.4 (p<0.001), and the difference was statistically significant. Comparing mortality, while there was 1 (0.7%) nonsurvivor out of 134 patients in the service unit, there were 20 (8.2%) nonsurvivors out of 245 patients in the intensive care unit. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.003). The cutoff value of myoglobin, which may pose a risk of mortality, was found to be 191.4 g/L, while it was 45.7 ng/l for hs-Tn and 60.1 U/L for creatine kinase MB.

Increased deSUMOylation in murine hearts by SENP2 upregulation resulted in cardiac dysfunction and congenital heart defects. Natural compounds via regulating cell proliferation and survival, induce cell cycle cessation, cell death, apoptosis, and producing reactive oxygen species and various enzyme systems cause disease prevention. Then, natural compounds can be suitable inhibitors and since SENP2 is a protein involved in heart disease, so our aim was inhibition of SENP2 by natural products for heart disease treatment. Material and methods: Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation of natural products i.e. Gallic acid (GA), Caffeic acid (CA), Thymoquinone (TQ), Betanin, Betanidin, Fisetin, and Ebselen were done to evaluate the SENP2 inhibitory effect of these natural products. The toxicity of compounds was also predicted. Results: The results showed that Betanin constituted a stable complex with SENP2 active site as it revealed low RMSD, high binding energy, and hydrogen bonds. Further, as compared to Ebselen, Betanin demonstrated low toxicity, formed a stable complex with SENP2 via four to seven hydrogen bonds, and constituted more stable MD plots. Therefore, depending upon the outcomes presented herein, Betanin significantly inhibited SENP2 and hence may be considered as a suitable natural compound for the treatment of heart failure.

However, preparations for large-scale manufacturing, such as building production facilities, are typically delayed until a vaccine is proven safe and effective. This makes sense from a commercial perspective, but incurs great costs in terms of lives lost and damage to the economy. Several policy options are available to reduce this delay, all of which involve incentives or subsidies to invest in production facilities. We review existing approaches, then propose a novel alternative using \\"option-based guarantees\\" in which the government commits to paying a proportion of the manufacturer's preparation costs should the product turn out not to be viable. Counterintuitively, this \\"payment for failure\\" is appropriate because in the case of success, a company makes a profit from the product itself, and does not need additional money from the government. While other approaches have critical roles, we argue that option-based guarantees are the most promising approach to ensuring a rapid vaccine for COVID-19.

DESIGN: A mixed-method design comprising an online survey and semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Allied health, nursing and medical students with a planned University Departments of Rural Health-facilitated rural or remote placement between February and October 2020. INTERVENTION: A planned rural or remote placement in 2020 facilitated by a University Departments of Rural Health, regardless of placement outcome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaire included placement outcome (completed or not), discipline of study (nursing, allied health, medicine), and Likert measures of impact to placement (including supervision, placement tasks, location, accommodation, client contact and student learning) and placement experience (overall, support, supervision, university support). Semi-structured interviews asked about placement planning, outcome, decisions, experience and student perceptions. RESULTS: While coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 reportedly impacted on the majority of planned placements, most students (80%) were able to complete their University Departments of Rural Health-facilitated placement in some form and were satisfied with their placement experience. Common placement changes included changes to tasks, setting, supervisors and location. Allied health students were significantly more likely to indicate that their placement had been impacted and also felt more supported by supervisors and universities than nursing students. Interview participants expressed concerns regarding the potential impact of cancelled and adapted placements on graduation and future employment. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was reported to impact the majority of University Departments of Rural Health-facilitated rural and remote placements in 2020.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a key component of protecting frontline clinicians against infection. The benefits of PPE far outweigh the risks, nonetheless, many clinicians are exhibiting skin injury caused by PPE worn incorrectly. These skin injuries, ranging from lesions to open wounds are concerning because they increase the susceptibility of viral infection and transmission to other individuals. Early into the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020), the U.S. National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) developed a series of position statements to improve wear-ability of PPE and protect healthcare professionals and their patients as safe from harm as possible under the circumstances. The NPIAP positions, which were formed by conducting a systematic review of what was known at the time, include: (1) Prepare skin before and after wearing PPE with skin sealants, barrier creams and moisturizers; (2) Frequent PPE offloading to relieve pressure and shear applied to skin; (3) treat visible skin injuries immediately caused by PPE to minimize future infection; (4) non-porous dressings may provide additional skin protection, but lack evidence; (5) health systems should take care to educate clinicians about placement and personal hygiene related to handling PPE. Throughout all of these practices, handwashing remains a top priority to handle PPE. These NPIAP positions provided early guidance to reduce the risk of skin injury caused by PPE based on available research regarding PPE injuries, a cautious application of evidence-based recommendations on prevention of device related pressure injuries in patients and the expert opinion of the NPIAP Board of Directors. Clinicians who adhere to these recommendations reduce the prospects of skin damage and long-term effects (e.g. scarring).

Methods A validated World Health Organization (WHO) questionnaire was used to collect data from 138 testing sites located in 138 health facilities in Ekiti State. The assessment was based on the activities carried out in the last three months before the study. Results A total of 138 testing sites participated in the study out of which 121 (87.7%) were primary health facility testing sites. The mean number of samples tested in these sites was 26 samples, and 97 (70.3%) testing sites were tested below this. The average quality performance of the secondary/tertiary health facility testing sites (64.46  10.47) was significantly higher than that of the primary health facility testing sites (53.13  13.54) (p = 0.002).

Usually, this condition results in higher risk of torsade de point and other life-threatening arrhythmias, related to unrecognized unpaired cardiac ventricular repolarization reserve (VRR).

However, the intradermal route of administration has been viewed as prohibitive to outbreak response campaigns. We aimed to establish the immunogenicity and safety of administering intradermal fIPV with a disposable syringe jet injector (DSJI) or an intradermal adaptor (IDA) compared with standard administration with a BCG needle and syringe (N&S). METHODS: This pragmatic, non-inferiority trial was undertaken in a campaign setting in communities in The Gambia. Children aged 4C59 months without contraindication to vaccination were eligible. Children were not individually randomly assigned; instead, the vaccination teams were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three administration methods. Parents and the field team were not masked, but laboratory personnel were masked. Baseline demographic and anthropometric data were collected from the participants. Public health officers experienced at intradermal immunisation, and nurses without experience, had 2 h of training on each of the administration methods before the campaign. Participants were vaccinated using the administration method in use by the vaccination team in their community. Poliovirus serum neutralising antibodies (SNA) were measured in children aged 24C59 months before and 4 weeks after vaccination. Adverse events and data on injection quality were collected from all participants. The primary outcome was the type 2 immune response rate (seroconversion in seronegative [SNA titre <8] children plus a 4-fold titre rise in seropositive children). Adjusted differences in the immune response between the DSJI or IDA group versus the N&S group were calculated with 975% CIs. A margin of ?10% was used to define the non-inferiority of DSJI or IDA compared to N&S. Immunogenicity analysis was done per protocol. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.govNCT02967783 and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Oct 28 and Dec 29, 2016, 3189 children aged 4C59 months were recruited, of whom 3170 were eligible. Over 3 days, 2720 children were vaccinated (N&S, 917; IDA, 874; and DSJI, 929). Among 992 children aged 25C59 months with a baseline SNA available, 901% (95% CI 861C929; 281/312) of those vaccinated using the DSJI had an immune response to type 2 compared with 938% (906C958; 331/353) of those vaccinated with N&S and 966% (940C980; 316/327) of those vaccinated with IDA. All (53/53) type 2 seronegative children seroconverted. For polio type 2, non-inferiority was shown for both the IDA (adjusted difference 07% [975% CI ?33 to 47], unadjusted difference 29% [C09 to 68]) and DSJI (adjusted difference ?33% [C83 to 15], unadjusted difference ?37% [C87 to 11]) compared with N&S. Non-inferiority was shown for type 1 and 3 for the IDA and DSJI. Neither injection quality nor the training and experience of the vaccinators had an effect on immune response. No safety concerns were reported. INTERPRETATION: In a campaign, intradermal fIPV is safe and generates consistent immune responses that are not dependent on vaccinator experience or injection quality when administered using an N&S, DSJI, or IDA. Countries facing vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 outbreaks should consider fIPV campaigns to boost population immunity and prevent cases of acute flaccid paralysis.

Ageing is known to be one of the significant determinants for COVID-19 severity. Two main reasons underlie this: immunosenescence and age correlation with main COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia. This study has two aims. The first is to obtain cut-off points for laboratory parameters that can help us in clinical decision-making. The second one is to analyse the effect of pandemic lockdown on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters concerning the severity of the COVID-19. For these purposes, 257 of SARSCoV2 inpatients during pandemic confinement were included in this study. Moreover, 584 case records from a previously analysed series, were compared with the present study data. RESULTS: Concerning the characteristics of lockdown series, mild cases accounted for 14.4, 54.1% were moderate and 31.5%, severe. There were 32.5% of home contagions, 26.3% community transmissions, 22.5% nursing home contagions, and 8.8% corresponding to frontline worker contagions regarding epidemiological features. Age > 60 and male sex are hereby confirmed as severity determinants. Equally, higher severity was significantly associated with higher IL6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and leukocyte counts, and a lower percentage of lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 count. Comparing this cohort with a previous 584-cases series, mild cases were less than those analysed in the first moment of the pandemic and dyslipidaemia became more frequent than before. IL-6, CRP and LDH values above 69 pg/mL, 97 mg/L and 328 U/L respectively, as well as a CD4 T-cell count below 535 cells/L, were the best cut-offs predicting severity since these parameters offered reliable areas under the curve.

However, there are gaps in understanding about why UK owners decide to get dogs. Using a mixed-methods convergent design, this study identified the reasoning behind dog acquisition in a sample of UK current and prospective owners. An online survey of current (n = 8,050) and potential (n = 2,884) dog owners collected quantitative and qualitative data. Current owners were asked about the acquisition of their most recently acquired dog, whilst potential owners were asked about their dog ownership aspirations. Additional qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with current (n = 166) and potential (n = 10) dog owners. Interviews focused on the factors that affected why and how people acquire dogs. Of survey responses, companionship for the respondent was the most common reason for wanting to get a dog, reported by 79.4 and 87.8% of current and potential owners, respectively. Facilitating exercise was reported as a reason for wanting to get a dog by 48.2 and 69.7% of current and potential owners, respectively. There were significant differences between current and potential owners in their likelihood of reporting pre-defined reasons, factors and influences involved in their decision to get a dog. Compared to current owners, potential owners were significantly more likely to report being motivated by most of the survey response options offered (including companionship for themselves or other adults in the household, helping a dog in need, lifestyle changes and previous experiences of meeting dogs), suggesting that current ownership status may affect experience and/or reporting expectations around dog ownership. Reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative data confirmed the importance of these motivations and identified additional reasons and factors that drive dog acquisition. These were organized into three overarching themes: Self-Related Motivation, Social-Based Motivation, and Dog-Related Positive Affect-Based Motivation. These findings provide insights into owners' expectations of ownership which may inform the development of interventions to support potential owners' decision-making around acquisition to maximize both dog and human welfare.","output":"Why Do People Want Dogs?

The task of identifying and recognizing an object in surveillance data is intriguing yet difficult due to the low resolution of captured images or video. The super-resolution approach aims to enhance the resolution of an image to generate a desirable high-resolution one. This paper develops a robust real-time face recognition approach that uses super-resolution to improve images and detect faces in the video. Many previously developed face detection systems are constrained by the severe distortion in the captured images. Further, many systems failed to handle the effect of motion, blur, and noise on the images registered on a camera. The presented approach improves descriptor count of the image based on the super-resolved faces and mitigates the effect of noise. Furthermore, it uses a parallel architecture to implement a super-resolution algorithm and overcomes the efficiency drawback increasing face recognition performance. Experimental analysis on the ORL, Caltech, and Chokepoint datasets has been carried out to evaluate the performance of the presented approach. The PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise-Ratio) and face recognition rate are used as the performance measures. The results showed significant improvement in the recognition rates for images where the face didnt contain pose expressions and scale variations. Further, for the complicated cases involving scale, pose, and lighting variations, the presented approach resulted in an improvement of 5%-6% in each case.","output":"Towards a super-resolution based approach for improved face recognition in low resolution environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virology laboratories historically have used direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and culture to detect six or seven respiratory viruses. Following the discovery of five new human respiratory viruses since 2000, there is an increasing need for diagnostic tests to detect these emerging viruses. We have developed a new test that can detect 20 different respiratory virus types/subtypes in a single 5-h test. The assay employs multiplex PCR using 14 virus-specific primer pairs, followed by a multiplexed target-specific primer extension (TSPE) reaction using 21 primers for specific respiratory virus types and subtypes. TSPE products were sorted and identified by using a fluid microsphere-based array (Universal Array; TmBioscience Corporation, Toronto, Canada) and the Luminex x-MAP system. The assay detected influenza A and B viruses; influenza A virus subtypes H1, H3, and H5 (including subtype H5N1 of the Asian lineage); parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus types A and B; adenovirus; metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; enterovirus; and coronaviruses OC43, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, NL63, and HKU1. In a prospective evaluation using 294 nasopharyngeal swab specimens, DFA/culture detected 119 positives and the respiratory virus panel (RVP) test detected 112 positives, for a sensitivity of 97%. The RVP test detected an additional 61 positive specimens that either were not detected by DFA/culture or were positive for viruses not tested for by DFA/culture. After resolution of discordant results by using a second unique PCR assay and by using a combined reference standard of positivity, the RVP test detected 180 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 98.5%, whereas DFA and culture detected only 126 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 68.8%. The RVP test should improve the capabilities of hospital and public health laboratories for diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections and should assist public health agencies in identifying etiologic agents in respiratory tract infection outbreaks.","output":"Development of a respiratory virus panel test for detection of twenty human respiratory viruses by use of multiplex PCR and a fluid microbead-based assay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic is expanding worldwide.

In general, ACE causes inflammation and vasoconstriction, while ACE2 leads to anti-inflammation activity and vasodilation. The disturbed balance between these counter-regulatory pathways could influence susceptibility to COVID-19. Notably, dysregulation of the RAS-equilibrium contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Differences in the incidence and symptoms of COVID-19 in diverse populations could be attributed to variability in the human genome. For example, ACE and ACE2 variations could modify the outcome of COVID-19 in different populations.

METHODS: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort were collected from 2002 to 2015. A 1:4 stratified cohort matched for age, sex, income, and residence region composing the COM group (n=23,436) and a control group (n=93,744) was selected. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of pneumonia occurring before the index date for COM were analyzed using a conditional logistic regression model. In addition, ORs of the number of diagnoses of pneumonia (5 times vs. <5 times) for COM were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia (9.3%) was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the COM group than in the control group (7.2%). The ORs of pneumonia were significantly higher in the COM group than in the control group. Pneumonia (adjusted OR=1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.25-1.38, p<0.001) increased the ORs for COM in all ages and gender.

The proposed framework considers the clustering as the forecasting pre-processing, which can improve the quality of the training models. To achieve the effective clustering, we propose a new similarity measure, called Logistic Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (LWDTW), by extending a Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (WDTW) method to capture the relative importance of return observations when calculating distance matrices. Especially, based on the empirical distributions of stock returns, the cost weight function of WDTW is modified with logistic probability density distribution function. In addition, we further implement the clustering-based forecasting framework with the above three deep learning models.

They may also drift toward tobacco smoking as a method to regulate their weight or to cope with their weight-related dysphoria. The occurrence of these conditions in EDs may prolong disease course and impede recovery. This study used structural equation modeling to investigate nutritional status (noted by body mass index, BMI), depression psychopathology, internet addiction (depicted by the Internet Addiction Test), Facebook addiction (depicted by the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale), and smoking among 123 Spanish women diagnosed with EDs (mean age = 27.3  10.6 years).

BMI did not predict depression, but it predicted internet addiction, Facebook addiction, and smoking in certain ED groups. Depression did not predict BMI, internet/Facebook addition, or smoking in any ED group. Some sociodemographic and clinical variables had indirect effects on depression, internet addiction, and Facebook addiction while age was the only variable expressing a direct effect on all outcome measures. Age, education, and history of prolonged treatment predicted smoking in certain ED patients. The findings signify that a considerable target for interventional strategies addressing nutritional and addictive problems in EDs would be women with high BMI, history of hospitalization, history of prolonged treatment, who are particularly young, single, and less educated.

Enteroviruses are genetically highly variable, and recombination between serotypes is known to be a major contribution to their diversity.

This study analyzed parts of the viral genes spanning the 5 non- coding region (NCR) through to the viral protein (VP) encoding sequences of 105 HRV field isolates from 51 outpatient cases of Acute Respiratory Infectious Network (ARINET) and 54 inpatient cases of severe lower respiratory infection (SLRI) surveillance, in order to identify recombination in field samples. When analyzing parts of the 5NCR and VP4/VP2 encoding sequences, we found intra- and interspecies recombinants in field strains of HRV-A and -C. Nineteen cases of recombination events (18.1%) were found among 105 field strains. For HRV-A, there were five cases (4.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination events. For HRV-C, there were four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and seven cases (6.7%) of interspecies recombination events. Recombination events were significantly more frequently observed in the ARINET samples (18 cases) than in the SLRI samples (1 case; P< 0.0001).

Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell, it leads to an exaggerated inflammatory state of the lungs mediated by overexpressed TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. We assessed azithromycin's effect on the aforementioned genes and their associated pathways to evaluate its potential use as a possible treatment. OBJECTIVE Confirm the role azithromycin may play in the regulation of pathways and genes involved in inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 activation and cell-to-cell transmission. METHODS Primary airway nasal epithelial cells collected from nasal biopsies of three patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were primary cultured and treated or not with 10g of azithromycin. RNA was extracted from these samples and analyzed using a microarray chip. Differential gene expression profiles and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were obtained between both groups. RESULTS Cell cultures treated with 10g of azithromycin significantly downregulated receptor-mediated endocytosis canonical pathways involving TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D genes. Downregulated inflammation-associated genes included IL-1 and NDST1. Interestingly, numerous genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were significantly upregulated as part of a potential process named drug-induced phospholipidosis (DLP). CONCLUSIONS This proof of concept demonstrates azithromycin downregulates pathways involving serine proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D required for SARS-CoV-2 activation and its cell-to-cell transmission while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1, NDST-1 and their associated pathways. This may help reduce the characteristic excessive respiratory epithelial inflammation, key feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.","output":"Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests: Common Questions and Answers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Philippine government has not announced a strategy for a safe return to in-person instruction.

A preliminary study aimed at obtaining the Italian translation of the first 16 item of HTQ IV part [1] which was administered, 20 months after the disaster, at 281 survivors. In backward stepwise logistic regressions models, we estimated among the respondent's characteristics and event-related variables the best predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) revealed a HTQ five-factors solution as best model, with satisfactory indexes of fit. HTQ held a positive correlation with both the SQD-P (r = .65, p < .05) and SQD-D subscales (r = .47, p < .05). ROC analysis suggested an area of .951 (95% CI = .917-.985) for the PTSD prediction. Basing on sensibility (.963) and specificity (.189), the best cut-off of 2.0 allowed discriminating for PTSD positive cases. After 20 months of the earthquake, the estimate prevalence of PTSD among the survivors is of 21.71% with a consistent and graded association between exposure variables and vulnerability factors (gender, age, exposure to death and home damage) and PTSD symptoms.","output":"Post-Traumatic Outcomes among Survivors of the Earthquake in Central Italy of August 24, 2016.

It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.","output":"Sustainable soil use and management: An interdisciplinary and systematic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges to nations. The Korean government aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through stay-at-home strategies and maintaining social distance, which are likely to result in major changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of citizens. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors in Koreans over 20 years old. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 104 adults in South Korea aged over 20 years. An online survey was conducted between August and October 2020, in which participants were asked to complete the Yonsei Lifestyle Profile to assess lifestyle changes, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale abbreviated version. To investigate the changes in peoples lifestyles, depression, and quality of life post COVID-19, descriptive statistics were calculated for these indicators before and after the onset of the pandemic. The p-value was two-sided, and values <0.05, were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities, including activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. However, there were no significant changes in nutrition, except in the consumption of carbohydrates and minerals. Participants reported that their quality of life and mental health had decreased after the pandemic struck. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained novel data on the changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of South Korean adults before and after the onset of the pandemic. The results of our study may assist health policymakers and practitioners in the development of health education or relevant interventions to deal with the pandemic situation as well as future crises.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of adults in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serious Games are video-games designed to support learning and start playing a role in education Serious games are used as an eLearning tool to complement traditional education or for distance learning Researchers have tested serious games in preschools and primary schools recently, and results started proving efficiency During the Covid19 study-from-home period in Morocco, we have developed a serious game for preschool to help practice logical reasoning and remembering We have used a process to design and develop the serious game by a collaborative team This process is based on a methodology called GLUPS (Serious Game Development Processes) During the development process, we had to adapt GLUPS to better fit with serious games for school children and with development carried by developers, not always familiar with game vocabulary and game development GLUPS helped us produce a playable well featured serious game quickly ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Methodology to Develop Serious Games for Primary Schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research views staff behavior as a complex mechanism of motivators through the lens of rationality, which obeys the principles of the transitivity axiom and the law of declining marginal utility in times of crisis, including the quarantine COVID-19 pandemic, budget constraints The factors which affect the behavior of hotel and restaurant staff form a field for understanding behavioral responses The interests and motives that regulate the behavior of the staff, in this case, reflect the map of utility, which allows modeling the usefulness of employment in an enterprise It is substantiated that the behavior of the staff should be correlated with the influence of leadership and agile management methods (Scrum, Kanban) The Agile determinants in the pandemic client-oriented management of the hotel and restaurant business provide an algorithmic explanation for the application of the approaches in practice Flexible management methods allow you to create organizational values for staff, which allows you to build value dependencies within cross-functional team management The result is the consideration of motivational types of staff and methods for choosing the right Agile approach It also suggested ways to reformat the hotel and restaurant business in the pandemic and change the professional roles of workers to survive and create conditions for rapid rehabilitation and recovery in the post-quarantine period","output":"Simulation of Behavior of Hotel and Restaurant Business Staff in the Conditions of COVID-19 Viral Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coastal flood risk is expected to increase as a result of climate change effects, such as sea level rise, and socioeconomic growth. To support policymakers in making adaptation decisions, accurate flood risk assessments that account for the influence of complex adaptation processes on the developments of risks are essential. In this study, we integrate the dynamic adaptive behavior of homeowners within a flood risk modeling framework. Focusing on building-level adaptation and flood insurance, the agent-based model (DYNAMO) is benchmarked with empirical data for New York City, USA. The model simulates the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and frequently proposed reforms to evaluate their effectiveness. The model is applied to a case study of Jamaica Bay, NY. Our results indicate that risk-based premiums can improve insurance penetration rates and the affordability of insurance compared to the baseline NFIP market structure. While a premium discount for disaster risk reduction incentivizes more homeowners to invest in dry-floodproofing measures, it does not significantly improve affordability. A low interest rate loan for financing risk-mitigation investments improves the uptake and affordability of dry-floodproofing measures. The benchmark and sensitivity analyses demonstrate how the behavioral component of our model matches empirical data and provides insights into the underlying theories and choices that autonomous agents make.","output":"An agent-based model for evaluating reforms of the National Flood Insurance Program: A benchmarked model applied to Jamaica Bay, NYC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The appropriate management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is particularly important during a pandemic;however, the intensive focus on COVID-19 prevention, and the lockdown and physical distancing restrictions affected NCD-related healthcare services adversely. We aimed to evaluate medication management practices for NCDs during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic across Europe and assess association with COVID-19 burden and country income. Methods: In December 2020, COST Action ENABLE (CA19132) conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey in 38 European countries and Israel on available face-to-face and e-health medication management services in place for NCDs. COVID-19 burden was defined as the number of positive cases and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants;country income was assessed as gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita) at purchasing power parity. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests and generalized linear models were applied in this analysis. Results: 53 experts (i.e., healthcare providers and academics with medical or pharmaceutical backgrounds) from 39 countries completed the survey. In 35 (90%) of countries face-to-face consultations were limited and this showed a positive association with the number of COVID-19 cases (p=0.03) and deaths (p=0.05). The mean (SD) number of available e-health services (including e-mail, online chat, phone, videoconference, electronic health record portal or other) was 3 (1.3) and this was positively associated with GDP/capita of countries (p=0.05). There was no further association between the evaluated variables. Conclusions: Although COVID-19 limited the number of face-to-face appointments in NCD care, it accelerated e-health solutions. Reduction in face-to-face consultations was associated with greater burden of COVID-19;however, the uptake of e-health services was associated with higher country income. This suggests significant disparities in maintaining services for NCDs across Europe during the second wave of the pandemic.","output":"POSB248 Medication Management Practices for Non-Communicable Diseases during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Snapshot of the European Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine use among otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons and facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons has accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, it is unclear what impact the increased adoption of telehealth will have on the doctor-patient relationship, patients' perceptions of individual practices, and the likelihood of patients proceeding with the next steps toward surgery. While an understanding of these complex questions is imperative for all otolaryngologists, it is extremely important for facial plastic surgeons who focus on elective procedures, particularly cosmetic/aesthetic operations. The use of telemedicine has the potential to reduce bias among patients seeking facial plastic surgery, especially cosmetic procedures.
