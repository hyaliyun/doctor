METHODS This chart review study analyzes patients who were treated with ECT using both the traditional and modified anesthesia protocols. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were analyzed, of whom 51 (48.1%) required BMV using the new protocol. Of clinical factors, only patient BMI was significantly associated with the requirement for BMV. Mean seizure duration reduced from 52.0  22.4 to 46.6  17.1 s, but seizure duration was adequate in all cases. No acute physical, respiratory, or psychiatric complications occurred during treatment.

Because demand can exceed capacity at different areas and across different times of the day, drivers have to refuse passenger boardings at specific stops. Towards this goal, many public transport operators have modified their service routes by avoiding to serve stops with high passenger demand at specific times of the day. Given the urgent need to develop decision support tools that can prevent the overcrowding of vehicles, this study introduces a dynamic integer nonlinear program that proposes service patterns to individual vehicles that are ready to be dispatched. In addition to the objective of satisfying the imposed vehicle capacity due to COVID-19, the proposed service pattern model caters for the waiting time of passengers. The model is tested in a bus line connecting the university of Twente with its surrounding cities demonstrating the improvement in terms of vehicle overcrowding, and analyzing the potential negative effects related to unserved passenger demand and excessive waiting times.","output":"Modifying the service patterns of public transport vehicles to account for the COVID-19 capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article outlines a secondary analysis of two European studies on innovative teacher professional development, through the lens of the Personal, Social and Learning to Learn European key competence. The 2018 European Recommendation describes it as being resilient, reflecting upon oneself, working with others, and managing time, information, learning and career. Adaptive, socio-emotional and metacognitive competences can be essential to harness other competences and navigate an unpredictable world, as argued in the LifeComp European framework. To nurture this key competence, teachers have to develop it themselves throughout the career. Innovative professional development can be a catalyst, addressing the complex and situated nature of teacher learning. It entails re-thinking time, space and mode of delivery, embedding active learning, relevance to practice, collaboration, coaching, feedback, and reflection. Innovative examples are presented as reciprocally related to Personal, Social and Learning to Learn, for resilient education systems in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Transmission by contact or at close range due to large respiratory droplets is widely accepted, however, the role of airborne transmission due to small respiratory droplets emitted by infected individuals (also asymptomatic) is controversial. It was suggested that outdoor airborne transmission could play a role in determining the differences observed in the spread rate. Concentrations of virus-laden aerosol are still poorly known and contrasting results are reported, especially for outdoor environments. Here we investigated outdoor concentrations and size distributions of virus-laden aerosol simultaneously collected during the pandemic, in May 2020, in northern (Veneto) and southern (Apulia) regions of Italy. The two regions exhibited significantly different prevalence of COVID-19. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 (RNA) was determined, using both real time RT-PCR and ddPCR, in air samples collected using PM10 samplers and cascade impactors able to separate 12 size ranges from nanoparticles (diameter D<0.056 m) up to coarse particles (D>18 m). Air samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 at both sites, viral particles concentrations were <0.8 copies m-3 in PM10 and <0.4 copies m-3 in each size range investigated. Outdoor air in residential and urban areas was generally not infectious and safe for the public in both northern and southern Italy, with the possible exclusion of very crowded sites. Therefore, it is likely that outdoor airborne transmission does not explain the difference in the spread of COVID-19 observed in the two Italian regions.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and virus-laden aerosol size distributions in outdoor air in north and south of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of breastfeeding for maternal and infant health is well-established, yet complex and intertwined sociocultural barriers contribute to suboptimal breastfeeding rates in most countries. Large-scale campaigns for evidence dissemination and promotion through targeted interventions on social media may help overcome some of these barriers. To date, most breastfeeding research on social media only focuses on content analysis, and there remains limited knowledge about the social networks of online communities (who interacts with whom), influencers in the breastfeeding space and the diffusion of evidence-based knowledge. This study, grounded in social network theory, aims to better understand the breastfeeding communication landscape on Twitter including determining the presence of a breastfeeding network, communities and key influencers. Further, we characterize influencer interactions, roles and the content being shared. The study revealed an overall breastfeeding social network of 3,798 unique individuals (users) and 3,972 tweets with commonly used hashtags (e.g., #breastfeeding and #normalizebreastfeeding). Around one third of users (n = 1,324, 34%) exchanged pornographic content (PC) that sexualized breastfeeding. The non-PC network (n = 2,474 users) formed 144 unique communities, and content flowing within the network was disproportionately influenced by 59 key influencers. However, these influencers had mostly inward-oriented interaction (% composition, E-I index: 47% professionals, -0.18; 41% interested citizens, -0.67; 12% companies, -0.18), limiting opportunities for evidence-based dissemination to the lay public. Although more tweets about peer-reviewed research findings were sent compared with tweets about nonevidence-based lay recommendations, our findings suggest that it is the lay public who often communicated findings, which may be overcome through a targeted social network-based intervention.","output":"Breastfeeding promotion on Twitter: A social network and content analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From a healthcare perspective, infection due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the ensuing syndrome called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents the biggest challenge the world has faced in several decades. Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals' capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising.

Despite its popularity, limited studies have examined relationships between brain concentrations of methylone, its metabolites, and pharmacodynamic effects. The goal of the present study was two-fold: 1) to determine pharmacokinetics of methylone and its major metabolites, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylcathinone (HMMC), 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylcathinone (HHMC), and 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone (MDC) in rat brain and plasma; 2) to relate brain pharmacokinetic parameters to pharmacodynamic effects including locomotor behavior and post-mortem neurochemistry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received s.c. methylone (6, 12, or 24 mg/kg) or saline vehicle (n=16/dose), and subgroups were decapitated after 40 or 120 min. Plasma and prefrontal cortex were analyzed for concentrations of methylone and its metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Frontal cortex and dorsal striatum were analyzed for dopamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Brain and plasma concentrations of methylone and its metabolites rose with increasing methylone dose, but brain methylone and MDC concentrations were greater than dose-proportional. Brain-to-plasma ratios for methylone and MDC were >3 (range 3-12), whereas those for HHMC and HMMC were <0.2 (range 0.01-0.2). Locomotor activity score was positively correlated with brain methylone and MDC, whereas cortical 5-HT was negatively correlated with these analytes at 120 min. Our findings show that brain concentrations of methylone and MDC display non-linear accumulation. Behavioral and neurochemical effects of systemically administered methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and MDC, but not its hydroxylated metabolites, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain. Significance Statement Behavioral and neurochemical effects of methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and its metabolite MDC, but not its hydroxylated metabolites, HMMC and HHMC, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain.

It has been reported that text clustering algorithms are hard to achieve better performance than supervised methods and their clustering performance is highly dependent on the picked text features. Currently, there are many different types of text feature generation algorithms, each of which extracts text features from some specific aspects, such as VSM and distributed word embedding, thus seeking a new way of obtaining features as complete as possible from the corpus is the key to enhance the clustering effects. In this paper, we present a hybrid multisource feature fusion (HMFF) framework comprising three components, feature representation of multimodel, mutual similarity matrices and feature fusion, in which we construct mutual similarity matrices for each feature source and fuse discriminative features from mutual similarity matrices by reducing dimensionality to generate HMFF features, then k-means clustering algorithm could be configured to partition input samples into groups.

We aim to define the anticoagulation pattern and its impact on outcomes (28-day survival, LOSICU, DVT, and PE and bleeding complications. We also observe if levels of D-Dimers affect the anticoagulation prescription. Methods: We analyzed data of all consecutive patients with Covid-19 ARDS admitted to ICU retrospectively. The primary variable of interest was anticoagulation. The daily dose of anticoagulant medication for each patient was recorded. Survival (28-day survival), Length of stay in ICU (LOSICU), the occurrence of DVT, PE, or bleeding were primary outcome variables. We also recorded confounding factors with potential impact on clinical outcomes. We assign Patients to one of the four groups based on anticoagulant dosing during the ICU (increasing dose, decreasing dose, increase followed by a decrease, multiple changes). We analyze the effect of different anticoagulation dosing strategies on 28-day survival, LOSICU, the occurrence of DVT, PE, and bleeding. We also observe if levels of D-Dimers affect the anticoagulation prescription. Results: The sample includes 149 patients. The most frequently used medication was subcutaneous Enoxaparin (85.2%). The Enoxaparin mean dose per day for the whole sample was 49.5mg + 15.7 (mean + SD). There was no significant difference in doses of anticoagulants between survivors and nonsurvivors (62.8 mg + 21.7 mg vs. 61.2 mg + 25.7mg, p 0.3). Multinomial regression showed no difference in 28-day survival among four-dose modification (increasing dose, decreasing dose, increase followed by a decrease, multiple changes). Logistic regression showed that BMI, D-Dimers, platelets, and the use of mechanical ventilation predict 28-day survival. Kaplan-Meier Survival plots for 4 anticoagulant groups showed no survival advantage for any anticoagulant strategy. Secondary outcome analysis showed that d-dimer levels significantly affect anticoagulants doses.

METHOD: Five-hundred and fourteen Hong Kong citizens (18 years or above) completed an online survey to measure illness perceptions toward COVID-19, coping, psychological flexibility, prosociality, and mental health, together with their socio-demographic variables. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the explanatory model that was the best-fit to illustrate the relationships between these constructs. RESULTS: Serial mediation structural equation model showed that only psychological flexibility (unstandardised beta coefficient,  = ? 0.12, 95% CI [? 0.20, ? 0.02], p = 0.031) and prosociality (unstandardised  = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08], p = 0.001) fully mediated the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health.

Examining through network perspectives, here we quantify the impact of spatial vaccination heterogeneity on COVID outbreaks and offer policy recommendations on location-based vaccination campaigns. Leveraging fine-grained mobility data and computational models, we investigate two network effectsthe hub effect (hubs in the mobility network usually have higher vaccination rates) and the homophily effect (neighboring places tend to have similar vaccination rates). Applying Bayesian deep learning and fine-grained epidemic simulations, we show a negative effect of homophily and a positive effect of highly vaccinated hubs on reducing COVID-19 case counts;these two effects are estimated to jointly increase the total cases by approximately 10% in the U.S. Moreover, inspired by these results, we propose a vaccination campaign strategy that targets a small number of regions with the largest gain in protective power. Our simulation shows that we can reduce the number of cases by 20% by only vaccinating an additional 1% of the population. Our study suggests that we must examine the interplay between vaccination patterns and mobility networks beyond the overall vaccination rate, and that accurate location-based targeting can be equally if not more important than improving the overall vaccination rate.","output":"Mobility network reveals the impact of spatial vaccination heterogeneity on COVID\\\\19 (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent introduction of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) into the North American swine herd has highlighted again the need for effective vaccines for swine coronaviruses.

METHODS The Yankauer and ETT-meconium aspirator device underwent a head-to-head timed comparison, suctioning 250 mL of three different fluids, varying in viscosity. The first comparison test used tap water to represent simple oral secretions. The second comparison test used porcine whole blood as a proxy for human blood. The third comparison test used a coarsely blended mixture of a hamburger, French fries, and a soda to simulate emesis from a recently ingested meal. Five separate time trials were conducted for each liquid and for each suction device. RESULTS The ETT-meconium aspirator device compared to the Yankauer suctioned faster in both the water comparison test (mean = 2.6 s vs. 3.4 s; p < 0.001) and the porcine whole blood comparison test (mean = 2.9 s vs. 4.3 s; p = 0.0015).

Energy efficiency is assessed by energy productivity (gross domestic product per unit of total primary energy supply) and energy intensity (total primary energy supply per capita). The world sample is divided into four income groups and an income-heterogeneous control group of non-renewable-resource-dependent economies. The study utilizes cross-sectionally dependent and stationary panel data from 2000 to 2018. The analysis of variance shows that higher income groups monotonically have higher levels in socio-economic productive capacities and energy intensity. The regression results from appropriate fixed-effects and random-effects modeling reveal varied driver and barrier influences of the socio-economic factors on energy efficiency improvements (higher energy productivity and lower energy intensity). In some cases, predictors scale up both energy productivity and energy intensity indicating the issue of the rebound effect. Higher human capital capacity stimulates energy efficiency except for middle-income groups. Higher transport capacity reduces energy productivity, except for upper-middle-income economies, and increases energy intensity for low-income and middle-income groups. The deployment of information-communication technologies is positively associated with energy productivity, except for low-income economies. Energy productivity performance of resource-dependent economies is improved by higher productive capacities in institutions and private sectors but impaired by structural change, whereas structural change drives energy efficiency in low-income economies. Additionally, the growth of gross national income per capita worsens energy efficiency for resource-dependent economies.

These measures included the closure of schools and universities, the closure of borders and airports, cancellation of public and religious gatherings, and mandatory quarantine for persons returning from traveling abroad. Such measures have played a major role in the control of COVID-19 spread. However, due to social and economic pressures, the government relaxed the lockdown. After relaxing the measures, a sharp increase in the number of patients was noticed. Besides, there was a significant increase in the number of symptomatic patients and the case fatality rate was doubled. In addition, the outbreak and outbreak response led to the loss of trust and a breakdown in relations between the society and local authority. To minimize the consequences for population health, local authority should have a plan that balances between health imperatives and socioeconomic imperatives. Finally, to be successful in controlling the infection, the government must rebuild public trust in the handling of COVID-19 outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings.","output":"A sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and case fatality rates after lifting the lockdown in Kurdistan region of Iraq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The traumatic abdominal wall hernia is a rare injury typically due to a high-energy blunt trauma mechanism. There is a lack of consensus on the appropriate management of these patients. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE A 43-year-old male was evaluated for a left flank bulge eight months after a motorcycle collision. He was diagnosed with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia at time of injury that was managed non-operatively. He noticed a left flank bulge two months after his collision that progressively worsened in size and in discomfort. The patient underwent laparoscopic repair of the traumatic flank hernia. His postoperative course was uneventful and there was no recurrence at 3 years. DISCUSSION Historically, exploratory laparotomy was considered necessary in patients diagnosed with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia at time of injury due to the high-percentage of concomitant intra-abdominal injuries. More recent studies suggest that some patients with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia may be safely managed non-operatively. A minority of these patients will require surgery for symptoms or complications related to the hernia and laparoscopic repair performed in a delayed fashion appears to have improved outcomes when compared to those that undergo repair at time of injury. CONCLUSION There is growing evidence supporting a non-operative management strategy in patients with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia who do not have a clear indication for abdominal surgery. These patients may be safely observed with delayed laparoscopic repair using synthetic mesh reserved for traumatic abdominal wall hernias that become symptomatic.","output":"Delayed laparoscopic repair of a traumatic flank hernia: A case report and review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The synthesis of vitamin D is related to sun exposure, thus the restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected the levels of vitamin D in all age groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vitamin D levels of healthy children and adolescents during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: The study group included healthy children and adolescents who were admitted for general check-ups and evaluated with 25 (OH) D levels. Then, it was divided into two groups: Group 1 'pre-pandemic', and Group 2 'pandemic'. Vitamin D levels were recorded from the hospital database and were compared according to age groups, gender, and the season, retrospectively. Results: The study group included 3033 children and adolescents;[(Group 1/Group 2: 1864/1169;mean age=90.29+/-59.45 median age =79 (IQR:102) months, M/F:1409/1624]. Although the mean 25 (OH) D levels among preschool children did not differ between groups, the vitamin D levels of school-aged children and adolescents were significantly lower in the pandemic period than in the pre-pandemic period [Group 1: median=16.50 (IQR:10.5) vs Group 2: median=15.9 (IQR:11.3) in 6-12 age group (p:0.026);Group 1: median=13.30 (IQR:10.2) Group 2: median=11.20 (IQR:9.7) in 12-18 age group (p:0.003)]. Moreover, the 25 (OH) D levels of adolescents showed seasonal variance with lower levels in winter, and in summer, unexpectedly. Conclusion: Pandemic-related restrictions have caused significant decreases in vitamin D levels of school-aged children and adolescents. We suggest that children and adolescents should be given vitamin D supplementation in order to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D during the pandemic.","output":"How did Vitamin D Levels of Children Change During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison of Pre-pandemic/Pandemic Periods due to Seasonal Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether peer-led group education + booklet is superior to booklet only to increase ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients knowledge about their disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 56 patients (46 males, 10 females; mean age 41.99.2 years; range, 22 to 58 years) with a definite diagnosis of AS who were under follow-up in our outpatient clinic between August 2010 and January 2012 were included in this study. The patients were randomly allocated to the peer-led education + booklet (education group, n=27) and booklet only (control group, n=29). To assess the level of patients knowledge, a patient knowledge questionnaire containing four domains was used. Evaluations were made at baseline, four weeks, and six months. The variables were number of correct choices (NoCC), number of correct items (NoCI) and percent of correct choices for each domain; the later one was resembled by the name of that domain (area A, area B, etc.). RESULTS: The variables that improved in both groups were NoCC, NoCI, and pharmacotherapy and physical therapy area (area C). These improvements were similar between the groups (respectively, p=0.915, p=0.830, p=0.791). CONCLUSION: Reading a booklet alone is as successful as peer-led education + booklet for knowledge transfer about their disease in patients with AS.

However, changes in pollutant concentrations are also affected by chemical transformation and meteorology. Decreases in concentrations were also not as obvious in Beijing when compared with Hubei Province, where lockdown was especially strict. Declines in concentrations between 2019 and 2020 are evident for both NO2 (37.0 to 26.2 g m-3) and SO2 (5.86 to 4.15 g m-3), but there was little evidence of change for PM2.5 (50.0 to 53.8 g m-3) and CO (0.71 to 0.74 mg m-3). Despite this, Fourier analysis revealed that the weekly cycle of PM2.5 evident in 2019 was not apparent in 2020.

The SARS COV2 pandemic highlighted weaknesses in the American healthcare system. This article explores the ability of American healthcare to adapt to this challenge. RECENT FINDINGS: With the COVID-19 pandemic, intensivists, and ventilators have been identified as the most critical components leading to shortages in ICU capacity. Anesthesiologists play a unique role in being able to provide 'flex capacity' with critical care staffing, space, and equipment (post-anesthesia care units, operating rooms, and ventilators). With the advent of APPs, intensive care physician staffing ratios may potentially be increased to cover patients safely in a physician-led team model. Tele-medicine expands this further and can allow hospital coordination for optimizing ICU bed use. SUMMARY: Although intensivists have been able to take care of the increased ICU caseload during the COVID-19 pandemic through recruiting other specialties, the question of what is the appropriate staffing model for the future is yet to be elucidated. Creating stronger multidisciplinary care teams that have the capacity to flex up critical care capacity may be the most prudent longer-term solution.","output":"Adequacy of workforce - are there enough critical care doctors in the US-post COVID?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the rapid production of vaccines aimed at the production of neutralizing antibodies against the COVID-19 spike protein required for the corona virus binding to target cells. The best well-known vaccines have utilized either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to direct human cells to produce the spike protein against which the body produces mostly neutralizing antibodies. However, recent reports have raised some skepticism as to the biologic actions of the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a response to oxidative stress is required by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes. In this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural anti-oxidants with multiple health effects. Hence, there are even more reasons to intervene with the use of anti-oxidant compounds, such as luteolin, in addition to available vaccines and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the harmful actions of the spike protein.","output":"Be aware of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: There is more than meets the eye"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The word pandemic is scary to whole world.

Silver nanoparticles are suggested as potent antitumor agents, but the side effects of silver overdoses may limit the application. The natural anti-oxidant -lipoic acid might prevent these side effects. We synthesized nanosilver and used it to treat several pancreatic cancer cells and normal cells in the presence or absence of -lipoic acid. Silver selectively eliminated pancreatic cancer cells and -lipoic acid supported the cytotoxicity, whereas benign cells largely resisted. -Lipoic acid formed complexes with silver particles and reduced silver-induced formation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial damage and liver toxicity. Our data suggest that nanosilver application in the presence of -lipoic acid is safe and effective in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. ABSTRACT: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted attention in cancer therapy and might support the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Silver is in clinical use in wound dressings, catheters, stents and implants. However, the side effects of systemic AgNP treatment due to silver accumulation limit its therapeutic application. We evaluated whether the antioxidant and natural agent -lipoic acid might prevent these side effects. We synthesized AgNPs using an Ionic-Pulser(?) Pro silver generator and determined the concentration by inductively coupled plasmaCoptical emission spectrometry. The effect of -lipoic acid was examined in four PDAC and two nonmalignant cell lines by MTT, FACS analysis, TEM, xenotransplantation and immunohistochemistry. The viability of PDAC cells was nearly totally abolished by AgNP treatment, whereas nonmalignant cells largely resisted. -Lipoic acid prevented AgNP-induced cytotoxicity in nonmalignant cells but not in PDAC cells, which might be due to the higher sensitivity of malignant cells to silver-induced cytotoxicity. -Lipoic acid protected mitochondria from AgNP-induced damage and led to precipitation of AgNPs. AgNPs reduced the growth of tumor xenografts, and cotreatment with -lipoic acid protected chick embryos from AgNP-induced liver damage. Together, -lipoic acid strongly reduced AgNP-induced side effects without weakening the therapeutic efficacy.","output":"Alpha-Lipoic Acid Prevents Side Effects of Therapeutic Nanosilver without Compromising Cytotoxicity in Experimental Pancreatic Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic calls for rapid actions, now principally oriented to a world-wide vaccination campaign.

Health care workers (184) with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were sampled soon before the second dose of vaccine and between 7 and 10 days after the second dose, the last sampling time was applied to SARS-CoV-2 na?ve individuals, too. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay. The study was powered for non-inferiority. We used non parametric tests and Pearson correlation test to perform inferential analysis. After a single vaccine injection, the median titer of specific antibodies in individuals with previous coronavirus disease 2019 was 30.527 U/ml (interquartile range [IQR]: 19.992-39.288) and in subjects with previous SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection was 19.367.5 U/ml (IQR: 14.688-31.353) (p = .032). Both results were far above the median titer in na?ve individuals after a full vaccination schedule: 1974.5 U/ml (IQR: 895-3455) (p < .0001).

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused marked disruptions in the delivery of surgical care worldwide. A thoughtful, structured approach to resuming surgical services is necessary as the impact of COVID-19 becomes better controlled. The Coronavirus Global Surgical Collaborative sought to formulate, through rigorous scientific methodology, consensus-based recommendations in collaboration with a multidisciplinary group of international experts and policymakers. METHODS: Recommendations were developed following a Delphi process. Domain topics were formulated and subsequently subdivided into questions pertinent to different aspects of surgical care in the COVID-19 crisis. Forty-four experts from 15 countries across 4 continents drafted statements based on the specific questions. Anonymous Delphi voting on the statements was performed in 2 rounds, as well as in a telepresence meeting. RESULTS: One hundred statements were formulated across 10 domains. The statements addressed terminology, impact on procedural services, patient/staff safety, managing a backlog of surgeries, methods to restart and sustain surgical services, education, and research. Eighty-three of the statements were approved during the first round of Delphi voting, and 11 during the second round.

High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020.-The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations.

Telemedicine has surged dramatically since the pandemic in efforts to maintain patient care and reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients, healthcare workers, and the public. Herein we present reports of three kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 that were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical records system, from home to inpatient settings. We demonstrate how telemedicine helped assess, diagnose, triage, and treat patients with COVID-19 while avoiding an emergency room or outpatient clinic visit. While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive NAT tests. Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. Yet in order to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care kidney transplant recipients are needed.","output":"Telemedicine in the Care of Kidney Transplant Recipients with COVID-19: Case Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to determine how Limb Deformity Modified Scoliosis Research Society (LD-SRS) scores differ between patients with different types and degrees of limb deformity compared with control subjects. METHODS: Patients who were >17 years and scheduled for reconstructive surgery for limb lengthening or angular deformity with internal and/or external fixation and healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Patients completed the LD-SRS preoperatively. Mechanical axis deviation (MAD) and leg length discrepancy (LLD) were recorded preoperatively. Participants were stratified into five groups based on their diagnosis. ANOVA was used to test for associations between LD-SRS scores and diagnosis as well as mechanical axis deviation. RESULTS: Patients with LLD, angular deformity, or combined LLD and angular deformity reported significantly worse scores than control subjects in LD-SRS Function/Activity, Pain, Self-Image/Appearance, and total score (P < 0.001 for all). Patients with short stature reported significantly worse LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance (P < 0.001) and total score compared with control subjects (P = 0.015). There was a significant correlation between LLD and LD-SRS Self-Image/Appearance in the LLD and angular deformity group (r = ?0.359, P = 0.043).

Many novel approaches have been proposed to attain better organ perfusion compared to traditional CPR techniques. The purpose of this review is to investigate the safety and efficacy of heads-up CPR versus supine CPR. Methods We searched PubMed Central, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from 1990 to February 2021. After the full-text screening of 40 eligible studies, only seven studies were eligible for our meta-analysis. We used the RevMan software (5.4) to perform the meta-analysis. Results In survival outcome, the pooled analysis between heads-up and supine CPR was (risk ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.17-5.68, p = 0.98). The pooled analyses between heads-up CPR and supine CPR in cerebral flow, cerebral perfusion pressure and coronary perfusion pressure outcomes, were (mean difference [MD] = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.03-0.17, p = 0.003), (MD = 12.28, 95% CI = 5.92-18.64], p = 0.0002), and (MD = 8.43, 95% CI = 2.71-14.14, p = 0.004), respectively. After doing a subgroup analysis, cerebral perfusion was found to increase during heads-up CPR compared with supine CPR at 6 min CPR duration and 18 to 20 min CPR duration as well. Conclusion Our study suggests that heads-up CPR is associated with better cerebral and coronary perfusion compared to the conventional supine technique in pigs' models. However, more research is warranted to investigate the safety and efficacy of the heads-up technique on human beings and to determine the best angle for optimization of the technique results.","output":"Efficacy of heads-up CPR compared to supine CPR positions: Systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the article was to reveal the international imbalances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic through the coordinates of chaos theory Methodologically it is a critical essay based on documentary observation To understand the current state of world politics and the balance of power in international relations, it is appropriate to use chaos theory At the beginning of the article, the origins of chaos theory are an interdisciplinary study, and its basic concepts are introduced The value of using chaos theory and its great potential for analysis and applications in the study of international relations is shown in the example of the 2019-2020 events in Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China (PRC) associated with the onset of a COVID-19 viral infection that has spread around the world At the end of the article, conclusions are drawn and the strengths and weaknesses of the use of chaos theory in dialectical relation to international relations are revealed, both as a field of study and at the same time as geopolitical reality","output":"Chaos Theory: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Wuhan, China from the perspective of international relations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of online follow-up on the quality of life of patients who undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molars.

METHODS We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on 27 migraine patients, using a well-established trigeminal nociceptive paradigm, examining patients before and two weeks after administration of the CGRP-receptor-antibody erenumab 70 mg. RESULTS Comparing both visit days in all patients (n=27) revealed that erenumab leads to a decrease in activation in the right thalamus (i.e. contralateral to the stimulated side), right middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left operculum, and several clusters on both sides of the cerebellum. Furthermore, when contrasting responders (n=9) and non-responders (n=8) of the respective same headache state, we found a significant reduction of hypothalamic activation after the administration of erenumab in responders only (T-value: 4.78; contrast estimate [90% CI]: 29.79 [19.53; 40.05]). This finding of reduced hypothalamic activation was confirmed when using the absolute headache days as a regressor.

DESIGN: Observational study conducted from 21 April to 6 May 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. SETTING: Research conducted in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy). PARTICIPANTS: Out of 2195 eligible participants, 1961 healthcare workers with the full range of professional profiles (89.3%) completed the survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Levels of burn-out, assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burn-out in each MBI-GS dimension (emotional exhaustion, EX; professional efficacy, EF; cynicism, CY). RESULTS: Overall, 38.3% displayed high EX, 46.5% low EF and 26.5% high CY. Burn-out was frequent among staff working in intensive care units (EX 57.0%; EF 47.8%; CY 40.1%), and among residents (EX 34.9%; EF 63.9%; CY 33.4%) and nurses (EX 49.2%; EF 46.9%; CY 29.7%). Being a resident increased the risk of burn-out (by nearly 2.5 times) in all the three MBI subscales and being a nurse increased the risk of burn-out in the EX dimension in comparison to physicians. Healthcare staff directly engaged with patients with COVID-19 showed more EX and CY than those working in non-COVID wards. Finally, the risk of burn-out was higher in staff showing pre-existing psychological problems, in those having experienced a COVID-related traumatic event and in those having experienced interpersonal avoidance in the workplace and personal life. CONCLUSIONS: Burn-out represents a great concern for healthcare staff working in a large tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact is more burdensome for front-line junior physicians. This study underlines the need to carefully address psychological well-being of healthcare workers to prevent the increase of burn-out in the event of a new COVID-19 healthcare emergency.","output":"Levels of burn-out among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associated factors: a cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital of a highly burdened area of north-east Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, there has been increasing momentum in telehealth development and delivery. To assess the anticipated exponential growth in telehealth, it is important to accurately capture how telehealth has been used in specific mental health fields prior to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to highlight how telehealth has been used with clinical samples in the neurodevelopmental field, including patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), their families, and health care professionals. To identify which technologies show the greatest potential for implementation into health services, we evaluated technologies for effectiveness, economic impact, and readiness for clinical adoption. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was undertaken in April 2018 and updated until December 2019, by using the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, and PsycInfo databases. Extracted data included the type of technology, how the technology was used (ie, assessment, treatment, and monitoring), participant characteristics, reported outcomes and authors views on clinical effectiveness, user impact (ie, feasibility and acceptability), economic impact, and readiness for clinic adoption. A quality review of the research was performed in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included participants and family members with autism spectrum disorders (21/42, 50%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (8/42, 19%), attention deficit hyperactivity or autism spectrum disorders (3/42, 7%), communication disorders (7/42, 17%), and tic disorders (2/42, 5%). The focus of most studies (33/42, 79%) was on treatment, rather than assessment (4/42, 10%) or monitoring (5/42, 12%). Telehealth services demonstrated promise for being clinically effective, predominantly in relation to diagnosing and monitoring NDDs. In terms of NDD treatment, telehealth services were usually equivalent to control groups. There was some evidence of positive user and economic impacts, including increased service delivery efficiency (eg, increased treatment availability and decreased waiting times). However, these factors were not widely recorded across the studies. Telehealth was demonstrated to be cost-effective in the few studies that considered cost-effectiveness. Study quality varied, as many studies had small sample sizes and inadequate control groups. Of the 42 studies, only 11 (26%) were randomized controlled trials, 12 (29%) were case studies or case series, 6 (14%) were qualitative studies, and 5 (12%) were noncomparative trials. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has the potential to increase treatment availability, decrease diagnosis waiting times, and aid in NDD monitoring. Further research with more robust and adequately powered study designs that consider cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency is needed. This systematic review highlights the extent of telehealth technology use prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement for investing in remote access to treatments.

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs. Method: We use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the MosMedData, which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs. Results: PointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. Conclusion: The PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources. Key Points: Our approach to GGO analysis has four distinguishing features: 1. We combine an unsupervised computer vision approach with convex hull and convex points algorithms to segment and preserve the actual structure of the lung. 2. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to use PointNet++ architecture for 3D visualization, segmentation, classification, and pattern analysis of GGOs. 3. We make abnormality predictions using a deep network and Cox proportional hazards model using lung CT images of COVID-19 patients. 4. We quantify the shapes and sizes of GGOs using Minkowski tensors to understand the morphological variations of GGOs within the COVID-19 cohort.","output":"AI-DRIVEN QUANTIFICATION OF GROUND GLASS OPACITIES IN LUNGS OF COVID-19 PATIENTS USING 3D COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is a synthesis of the historical account of the ongoing suppression of Mori indigeneity (language and cultural knowledge) in mathematics education for over 100 years. During that time, Mori, the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, have been ravaged by the effects of globalisation as an outcome of colonisation, resulting in loss of property, linguistic, and cultural rights, that have been compounded by the damaging effects of diseases that have cumulatively sustained negative socioeconomic and education outcomes to this day. The COVID-19 pandemic, which arrived on Aotearoa New Zealand shores in February 2020, exposed and further exacerbated the deep inequities that already existed due to the legacy of assimilation policies. This article draws on Bourdieus notions of capital, habitus, and field to frame our analysis of the capacity and potential for Mori to act as agents within, and against, multiple cultural and structural pressures that have impacted the historical development of Mori-medium mathematics education, and the capacity of the Mori-medium mathematics community to cope while schools were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Health professionals have been experiencing physical and mental fatigue, affective disorders, and sleep problems due to the stress experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. As in most outbreaks and pandemics, nurses are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus and have experienced high anxiety levels. People can resort to many methods of coping with stressful situations, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Introduction Objective ? The study intended to assess nurses' anxiety levels about COVID-19 during the peak period of its second wave in Turkey and to examine the methods that they used to cope with that anxiety as well as their attitudes toward CAM. Introduction Design ? The research team designed a descriptive and cross-sectional study. Introduction Setting ? The study was conducted in a training and research hospital in the Aegean region of Turkey between February 2021 and May 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Introduction Participants ? Participants were 168 nurses working in the hospital. Introduction Outcome Measures ? Data were collected with the Sociodemographic Information Form, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and Holistic Complementary and Alternative Health Questionnaire (HCAMQ), which has two subdimensions, CAM and Holistic Health (HH). Introduction Results ? A significant relationship was found between the unit where the nurses worked and their scores on the CAM subdimension (P < .037). A significant relationship was also found between the nurses' anxiety about the COVID-19 epidemic and the scores on the holistic health (HH) subdimension (P < .001) and the HCAMQ (P < .016). To cope with anxiety, the nurses who experienced anxiety used the following complementary methods: (1) saying prayers and worshipping (56.6%), (2) taking hot and cold showers (54.6%), and (3) drinking herbal teas and infusions (49.3%). A weak correlation was found between the CAS, CAM, and HCAMQ scores (P < .05). Introduction Conclusions ? The current study found that it could be beneficial for nurses to apply complementary methods to reduce their anxiety, because it's not known how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue. In line with these results, it's extremely important to determine the psychological symptoms and to determine the priorities for solving these problems in nurses. Therefore, it's recommended that nurses should identify their anxieties about COVID-19 and that they should use complementary methods to manage their anxieties.","output":"Nurses' Use of Holistic, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Methods Against COVID-19 Anxiety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Several studies have revealed the potential use of tocilizumab in treating COVID-19 since no therapy has yet been approved for COVID-19 pneumonia Tocilizumab may provide clinical benefits for cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients Methods: We searched for relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane published from March to October 2020 to evaluate optimal use and baseline criteria for administration of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients Research involving patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated with tocilizumab and compared with the standard of care (SOC) was included in this study We conducted a systematic review to find data about the risks and benefits of tocilizumab and outcomes from different baseline criteria for administration of tocilizumab as a treatment for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients Results: A total of 26 studies, consisting of 23 retrospective studies, one prospective study, and two randomised controlled trials with 2112 patients enrolled in the tocilizumab group and 6160 patients in the SOC group, were included in this meta-analysis Compared to the SOC, tocilizumab showed benefits for all-cause mortality events and a shorter time until death after first intervention but showed no difference in hospital length of stay Upon subgroup analysis, tocilizumab showed fewer all-cause mortality events when CRP level 100 mg/L, P/F ratio 200-300 mmHg, and P/F ratio &lt;200 mmHg However, tocilizumab showed a longer length of stay when CRP &lt;100 mg/L than the SOC Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that tocilizumab has a positive effect on all-cause mortality It should be cautiously administrated for optimal results and tailored to the patient's eligibility criteria ? 2021 Nugroho CW et al","output":"Optimal use of tocilizumab for severe and critical COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal mesh repair (TEP) of inguinal hernia has become well accepted with low recurrence and high patient satisfaction rates. However, inguinal pain has also been reported. Source of this pain has been suggested to be the fixation method, especially the use of tacks. Introduction of fibrin glue and absorbable tacks were suggested to lower chronic pain and inguinal discomfort rates. This study analyses the different methods of fixation. PATIENTS AND METHODS 201 patients were analysed. Primary end-points were patients' satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and specific inguinal conditions (e.g. pulling, swelling, troubles at coughing). Secondary endpoints were duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and material costs. RESULTS Fibrin glue was used in 101 patients and tacks in 100 patients, in 21 of those absorbable tacks. Patients were fully satisfied with the results in more than 90%, irrespective of the fixation method. Health-related quality of life along the SF-12(?) questionnaire attested no differences. Inguinal pulling occurred significantly more often after fibrin glue (25.7 %) than after tack fixation (11 %; p = 0.026), whereas no differences in the other specific inguinal sensations occurred. CONCLUSION Mesh fixation in TEP can be performed either by tacks or by fibrin glue with similar long-term results concerning satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and pain. No advantage of fibrin glue could be found, in fact, a higher percentage of patients had inguinal pulling and burning sensations after the use of fibrin glue.

The analysis focuses on Brazil as an emblematic example, as the country has been facing the pandemic without being able to rely on a comprehensive and properly supervised data protection law, while also failing to adopt data-driven responses which could have helped to raise awareness and prevent the spread of the virus. Although the relationship between the adopted policies and the unwavering rise of contagions and deaths is one of correlation, and not necessarily causation, it is argued that an examination of the facts through the lenses of the Convention and its case-law could give sufficient grounding to a claim of responsibility for failure to ensure sufficient protection to the right to privacy, life and integrity. To substantiate such claim, the article begins by describing the Brazilian governments approach towards the health risks raised by the pandemic (Section 2), and highlighting the privacy and data protection questions raised by technological solutions that are dependent on the collection and use of personal data (Section 3). It follows with an overview of the troubled process of entry into force of a general data protection law in the country, and of a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated the governments attempt to make use of personal data in order to gather evidence for the adoption of economic measures (Section 4).

NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower.

Using data from a national, multicentre, prospective cohort, we aimed to characterise people with COVID-19 admitted to hospital with underlying respiratory disease, assess the level of care received, measure in-hospital mortality, and examine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: We analysed data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study. All patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 across England, Scotland, and Wales between Jan 17 and Aug 3, 2020, were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Patients with asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or both, were identified and stratified by age (<16 years, 16-49 years, and &#8805;50 years). In-hospital mortality was measured by use of multilevel Cox proportional hazards, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medications (inhaled corticosteroids, short-acting ?-agonists [SABAs], and long-acting ?-agonists [LABAs]). Patients with asthma who were taking an inhaled corticosteroid plus LABA plus another maintenance asthma medication were considered to have severe asthma. FINDINGS: 75 463 patients from 258 participating health-care facilities were included in this analysis: 860 patients younger than 16 years (74 [86%] with asthma), 8950 patients aged 16-49 years (1867 [209%] with asthma), and 65 653 patients aged 50 years and older (5918 [90%] with asthma, 10 266 [156%] with chronic pulmonary disease, and 2071 [32%] with both asthma and chronic pulmonary disease).

In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of hospital admission was associated with decreased mortality in those with asthma, compared to those without an underlying respiratory condition (adjusted HR 086 [95% CI 080-092]). INTERPRETATION: Underlying respiratory conditions are common in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Regardless of the severity of symptoms at admission and comorbidities, patients with asthma were more likely, and those with chronic pulmonary disease less likely, to receive critical care than patients without an underlying respiratory condition. In patients aged 16 years and older, severe asthma was associated with increased mortality compared to non-severe asthma. In patients aged 50 years and older, inhaled corticosteroid use in those with asthma was associated with lower mortality than in patients without an underlying respiratory condition; patients with chronic pulmonary disease had significantly increased mortality compared to those with no underlying respiratory condition, regardless of inhaled corticosteroid use. Our results suggest that the use of inhaled corticosteroids, within 2 weeks of admission, improves survival for patients aged 50 years and older with asthma, but not for those with chronic pulmonary disease.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020. Participants were recruited by an Internet-based survey company. A total of 659 patients (54% male, average age 60  14 years) who had regularly scheduled outpatient visits prior to the onset of COVID-19 were enrolled. Participants answered four questions (\\"decrease in medical visit frequency,\\" \\"inability to take regular medication,\\" \\"deterioration of a chronic disease,\\" and \\"utilization of telephone/online medical care\\") and stated whether they had a fear of acquiring infection at a medical facility. The associations between answers, fear of infection, and socio-demographic factors were examined. Results: Among the participants, 37.8% had decreased their medical visits, 6.8% were unable to take regular medications, 5.6% experienced a deterioration of chronic disease, and 9.1% utilized telephone/online medical care. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 at medical facilities was strongly associated with a reduced frequency of medical visits and lack of regular medications even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors and current medical histories. Conclusions: During the first wave of COVID-19, approximately 40% of participants reduced their frequency of medical visits. It is important to continue implementing thorough infection control measures at facilities and educating the public the importance of keeping chronic diseases in good condition, as well as promoting telephone/online medical care.","output":"Changes in the medical treatment status of Japanese outpatients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus worldwide has led the World Health Organization to declare a COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The OE-MRI was based on a respiratory-gated three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE sequence. For each patient, the percent signal enhancement (PSE) map was calculated using the expression PSE = (S100% - S21%)/S21%, where S21% and S100% are signals acquired during room air and 100% oxygen inhalation, respectively. Agreement of lesion detectability between UTE-MRI and computed tomography (CT) was performed using the kappa test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean PSE between mild-type COVID-19 and common-type COVID-19. Spearman's test was used to assess the relationship between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in region of interest (ROI) mean PSE between normal pulmonary parenchyma and lesions. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to test the difference in the mean PSE between different lesion types. RESULTS: CT and UTE-MRI reached good agreement in lesion detectability. Ventilation measures in mild-type patients (5.3  5.5%) were significantly different from those in common-type patients (3  3.9%). Besides, there was no significant correlation between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. The mean PSE of COVID-19 lesions (3.2  4.9%) was significantly lower than that of the pulmonary parenchyma (5.4  3.9%). No significant difference was found among different lesion types.

METHODS: The study included a total of 359 patients (245 males, median age: 40, min-max: 18-95) with blunt multi-trauma. De-mographics data, laboratory parameters (hemoglobin [Hb], hematocrit [Htc], lactate, BD, pH), physiologic parameters (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR]), shock index (SI), and revised trauma score (RTS) were recorded. Logistic regression method was used to create the CS formula using lactate and BD values. According to this formula, the probability value of 0.092447509 was calculated for the need for blood transfusion within 24 h. If CS was higher than the probability value, the need for blood transfusion within 24 h was considered. Furthermore, univariate analysis was used to determine major risk for blood transfusion need in 24 h, and the receiver operating characteristic curves were performed to compare CS, lactate, BD, SI and RTS. RESULTS: The comparison between transfusion and non-transfusion group there was significance between SBP, DBP, HR, RR, SpO2, Glasgow coma scale, Hb, Htc, lactate, BD, pH, SI and RTS (for each p<0.05). Lactate value has a positive correlation with SI, HR and has a negative correlation with BD, RTS, SBP, and DBP. BD values has a positive correlation with RTS, SBP, DBP, Hb, and Htc and has a negative correlation with SI, HR, and RR. The main risks for blood transfusion need were SI, lactate, BD, SBP, and SpO2%. CS was 0.09 in 100 (27.85%) patients and 41 with high CS had blood transfusion within 24 h (p<0.001; OR21.803, sensitivity 83.7%, specificity 81%,positive predictive value 41%, and negative predictive value 96.9%).

Objectives: To investigate the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and their outcomes in patients with IMID compared with matched non-IMID patents from the general population. Methods: A population-based, matched cohort study was conducted in adults living in Ontario, Canada using health administrative data. Ten cohorts of the following IMID were assembled: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs, including systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's, myositis), multiple sclerosis (MS), iritis, inflammatory bowel disease, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and vasculitis (including giant cell arteritis and other types of vasculitidies). Each patient was matched with 5 non-IMID comparators based on age, sex, area of residence and living in long-term care (LTC). Patients who were admitted to hospital from January 1st to July 31th, 2020 and had ICD-10 COVID-19 diagnosis codes (U07.2 or U07.1) were identified. Among those with COVID-19 hospitalizations, we determined those with admissions to intensive care unit or required mechanical ventilation or died in hospital ('complicated hospitalization'). Age-sex-standardized rates were compared between IMID and non-IMID patients and risk factors for hospitalizations were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: In total, 493,499 IMID (417 hospitalized) and 2,466,946 non-IMID patients (1,519 hospitalized) were assessed. The age-sex-standardized rate of COVID-19 hospitalization was higher in IMID (6.4 per 10,000, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8, 7.2) versus non-IMID patients (4.8 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.5, 5). The highest rates of hospitalizations were found in vasculitis (18/10,000), MS (16.7/10,000) and PMR (10.1/10,000). IMID diagnosis was associated with 37% higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% CI 1.23, 1.53) (Figure 1). This risk was slightly attenuated after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities but remained elevated by 23% compared to non-IMID (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10, 1.37). The risk for hospitalizations was increased in RA, vasculitis, SARDs, PsA, MS and iritis (Figure 1). Risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalizations included older age, male sex, lower income, multimorbidity and living in long-term care (Table 1). The risk for complicated COVID-19 hospitalizations was higher by 21% in IMID patients (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02, 1.43), however, this association was attenuated after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities (OR 1.08). Conclusion: Patients with IMID were at higher risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and for having complicated hospitalizations.

The role of thiamine in critically ill septic patient has been addressed in multiple studies; however, its role in COVID-19 patients is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of thiamine as an adjunctive therapy on mortality in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: This is a two-center, non-interventional, retrospective cohort study for critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID19. All patients aged 18 years or older admitted to ICUs between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, with positive PCR COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. We investigated thiamine use as an adjunctive therapy on the clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients after propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 738 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who had been admitted to ICUs were included in the study. Among 166 patients matched using the propensity score method, 83 had received thiamine as adjunctive therapy. There was significant association between thiamine use with in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.39; 95% CI 0.19C0.78; P value = 0.008) as well as the 30-day mortality (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.18C0.78; P value = 0.009).

Nutrient-dense meat and animal products are often the lynchpin of these diets, even when consumed only occasionally and in moderate amounts. Red meat provides forms and concentrations of essential proteins, lipids, and micronutrients that are scarce in exclusively vegetarian regimens. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to consider the effects of moderate consumption of lean red meat as part of an otherwise vegetarian balanced diet and its impact on biomarkers of sustained health and well-being. METHODS: A cohort of healthy, young (20-34 years old, n=80) male and female participants will take part in a 2-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a duration of 12 weeks, with a 3-month posttrial follow-up. The trial will commence with a 2-week assessment period followed by allocation to the intervention arms. The intervention will include the consumption of red meat or meat alternatives 3 times per week for 10 weeks. Blood samples of the participants will be collected to measure changes in erythrocyte fatty acid distribution, circulating amino acids, neurotransmitters, markers of mineral status, and inflammatory markers. Questionnaires to assess well-being and mental health will be undertaken every 2 weeks. Body composition, physical function, and blood parameters will be assessed at allocation (t(0)), week 5 into the intervention (t(5)), and post intervention (t(10)). RESULTS: The protocol has been developed using the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) checklist and the outcomes will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines.

METHODS: This study was based on the most recent nationally representative Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. Height-for-age z scores (HAZ) were used as an indicator for assessing the nutritional status of under-five children. Quantile regression was used to examine the heterogeneous association of covariates with conditional HAZ distribution across the different quantiles (0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.85). As a comparison, the effects of covariates at conditional mean of HAZ using OLS regression was also analysed. The graphs were plotted to visualize the changes in the coefficients for each regressor across the entire conditional HAZ distribution. RESULTS: Age of children, sex of children, province and wealth had a consistent and statistically significant association with HAZ in both OLS and quantile regression. Improved toilet facility was positively correlated with HAZ at the lower tails (tenth and thirtieth percentiles). Ethnicity (Janajati and Newer) was positively correlated with HAZ at the lower tail (thirtieth percentile) and mean (OLS regression). Maternal education was a significant predictor of improved height-for-age across conditional quantiles, except at the tenth percentile. Maternal age, number of under-five children in household, number of household members, and improved source of drinking water showed heterogeneous effects across different quantiles of conditional HAZ distribution. CONCLUSION: Use of quantile regression approach showed that the effect of different factors differed across the conditional distribution of HAZ. Policymakers should consider the heterogeneous effect of different factors on HAZ so that the targeted intervention could be implemented to maximize the nutritional benefits to children.

Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid\`s Xpert? Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%).

The recent development of the virus has witnessed at least 17 mutations that may affect its external shape, especially on the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which helps it attach to human cells' receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) to make RBD-ACE2 interaction and entry to host cell. This interaction becomes stronger in the new strains of the coronavirus due to a mutation that occurs in the S-proteins that attach to human cells. For researchers and scientists to be able to confront this pandemic that has spread in the world like wildfire, they must be armed with accurate understanding and clear knowledge about coronavirus. This study focuses on polysaccharides, specifically negatively polysaccharides, that can interfere with the positive charge of the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thus inhibiting the virus's infectivity and destroying it. In addition, polysaccharides will boost the immune function of the vaccine, thereby fostering nonspecific immunity of the body and specific immunity of the body, cellular immunity, mucosal immunity, humoral immunity, and decreased pro-inflammatory expression. This research aims to reduce the attachment power and modify the pulling apart of the RBD and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by polysaccharide molecules such as Arabic gum (AG) and carrageenan. The adapted fluorometric assay is used to investigate the probability of Arabic gum and ACE2 interactions. The obtained results confirmed that the interaction could take place between Arabic gum and ACE2. Several literature studies promote the use of the urchin egg as antiviral, especially for SARS-CoV-2, because it has sulfated fucan polysaccharide molecules that prevent interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with a host cell. But, to the best of our knowledge, we found that the effect of urchin egg as antiviral, especially for SARS-CoV-2 is very difficult due to the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the human cells containing sugars that terminate with N-glycolylneuraminic (Neu5Ac) as found in the sperm of sea urchin.

Since conventional methods are fairly limited, there is a need for an alternative method such as THz spectroscopy with the utilization of THz metamaterials. This paper proposes a method for sensitivity characterization, which is demonstrated on two chosen multi-band THz metamaterial sensors and samples of three different subtypes of the influenza A virus. Sensor models have been simulated in WIPL-D software in order to analyze their sensitivity both graphically and numerically around all resonant peaks in the presence of virus samples. The sensor with a sandwiched structure is shown to be more suitable for detecting extremely thin virus layers. The distribution of the electric field for this sensor suggests a possibility of controlling the two resonant modes independently. The sensor with cross-shaped patches achieves significantly better Q-factors and refractive sensitivities for both resonant peaks. The reasoning can be found in the waveCsample interaction enhancement due to the better electromagnetic field confinement. A high Q-factor of around 400 at the second resonant frequency makes the sensor with cross-shaped patches a promising candidate for potential applications in THz sensing. ? 2022 by the authors.

METHODS: After high-level meetings at the Ministry of Health in Rwanda (MOH), in 2016, a capacity building plan focusing on improved clinical services, quality improvement/research and leadership capacity across prehospital and emergency settings. The main themes for the collaborative model included for empowerment of staff, improving clinical service delivery, and investing in systems and infrastructure. Funding was sought and incorporated into the Sector Wide Approaches to Planning process at the Ministry of Health of Rwanda. FINDINGS: A shared mental model was created through a fully funded immersion program for Rwandese leaders from emergency medicine, nursing, prehospital care, and injury policy. Prehospital care delivery was standardized within Kigali through a train-the-trainers program with four new context-appropriate short courses in trauma, medical, obstetric/neonatal, and pediatric emergencies and expanded across the country to reach >600 staff at district and provincial hospitals. Forty-two protocols and checklists were implemented to standardize prehospital care across specialties. The WHO Trauma Registry was instituted across four major referral centers in the country capturing over 5,000 injured patients. Long-term research capacity development included Masters Degree support for 11 staff.

However, psychosocial treatments for cocaine use disorders are limited, and no pharmacotherapy is approved by regulatory bodies in the U.S. or Europe. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to assess treatments impacts on cocaine use. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials that included the word \\"cocaine\\" in the title and were published between 31/12/1995 and 31/12/2017. All studies of outpatient adults with active cocaine use and reporting urinalysis results were included. Treatment approaches were clustered into 11 categories. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. We calculated intention-to-treat log-odds ratios (OR) for the change in proportion of patients testing negative for cocaine at the end of each study and performed multivariate mixed-effects meta-regression. This study was prospectively registered on covidence.org on 31/12/2015, study 8731. Findings: One hundred fifty-seven studies with 15,842 participants were included. Only contingency management was significantly associated with increased odds of testing negative for cocaine (OR of 2.13, 95% CI 1.62-2.80) and remained significant after all sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: This meta-analysis is unique in its broad inclusivity of treatment types and trial designs over a two-decade period of investigation. Our results converge with focused meta-analyses on treatments for cocaine use disorders; thus, research efforts and policy changes that expanded implementation of contingency management programs are expected to reduce cocaine use in active users and the associated individual, community, and societal burdens associated.","output":"A meta-analysis of cocaine use disorder treatment effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several restriction policies implemented in many states in the United States have demonstrated their effectiveness in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but less is known about the differences in views on the restriction policies among different population segments. This study aimed to understand which different population groups of adults in the United States consider several key restriction policies as necessary to combat COVID-19. Survey data from Wave 64 (March 19-24, 2020) of the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (n=10,609) and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, employment status, political party affiliation, news exposure, census region, and opinions about COVID-19 restriction policies. The policies included restricting international travel, imposing business closures, banning large group gatherings, cancelling entertainment events, closing schools, limiting restaurants to carry-out only, and postponing state primary elections. Most survey respondents viewed COVID-19 restriction policies as necessary. Views on each restriction policy varied substantially across some population segments such as age, race, and ethnicity. Regardless of population segments, those who followed news closely or considered themselves Democrat/lean Democrat were more likely to consider all the policies as necessary than those not following the news closely or those who considered themselves Republican/lean Republican. The effectiveness of key COVID-19 restriction policies is likely to vary substantially across population groups given that views on the need to implement these policies vary widely.

Approximately 4 years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19, family adversity related to COVID-19, and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or HRV augmentation, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Conversely, lower resting HRV indicated vulnerability to the effect of COVID-19 family adversity on emotional problems.

Methods: Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1st January 2017 to 7th August 2020. Care home level data linked with CQC care home register to identify homes characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent), and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. Findings: Up to 7th August 2020 there were 29,542 (95%CI: 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95%CI: 5.5% to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95%CI: 56.4% to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.6 to 2.0); to older people and/or with dementia (OR: 5.5, 95%CI: 4.4 to 6.8); among larger (vs. small) homes (OR: 13.3, 95%CI: 11.5 to 15.4); belonging to a large provider/brand (OR: 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers. Interpretation: To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission.

DESIGN: A correlational and cross-section research design was used to collect over 82,000 useable data points of historical workload data from the three unique systems on a medical-surgical unit in a midsized hospital in the southeast United States over a 60-day period. Data were collected prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: Combined data were analyzed using JMP Pro version 12. Mean responses from two groups were compared using a t-test and those from more than two groups using analysis of variance. Logistic regression was used to determine the significance of impact each workload variable had on individual nurses' ability to administer medications successfully as measured by occurrence of NMs. FINDINGS: The mean outcome of each of the six workload factors measured differed significantly (p < .0001) among nurses. The mean outcome for all workload factors except the hours worked was found to be significantly higher (p < .0001) for those who committed an NM compared to those who did not. At least one workload variable was observed to be significantly associated (p < .05) with the occurrence or nonoccurrence of NMs in 82.6% of the nurses in the study. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of the nurses in our study, the occurrence of an NM was significantly impacted by at least one workload variable. Because the specific variables that impact performance are different for each individual nurse, decreasing only one variable, such as patient load, will not adequately address the risk for NMs. Other variables not studied here, such as education and experience, might be associated with the occurrence of NMs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the majority of nurses, different workload variables increase their risk for an NM, suggesting that interventions addressing medication errors should be implemented based on the individual's risk profile.","output":"Nurse's Achilles Heel: Using Big Data to Determine Workload Factors That Impact Near Misses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Less than 1% of the US population lives in long-term care facilities, yet this subset of the population accounts for 22% of total COVID-19 related deaths.1 Because of a lack of experimental evidence to treat COVID-19, analysis of real-world data to identify causal relationships between treatments/policies to mortality and morbidity among high-risk individuals is critical.

It is important to determine how relationships between key outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. METHOD: Data was gathered over 4 months (March - June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson's product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. RESULTS: The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both.

Secondly, national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups.

In particular, the EU should help Member States procure and validate tests for infection and immunity. The EU should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work, thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods. We see a great advantage in such EU guidance: it could improve mutual learning between Member States, which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons.

Antibacterial and anti-eukaryotic functions of the T6SS depend on its secreted effectors that target multiple cellular processes. However, the mechanisms that account for effector diversity and different effectiveness during interspecies competition remain elusive. Here we report that environmental cations and temperature play a key role in dictating cellular response and effector effectiveness during interspecies competition mediated by the T6SS of V. cholerae. We found that V. cholerae could employ its cell-wall-targeting effector TseH to outcompete the otherwise resistant Escherichia coli and the V. cholerae immunity deletion mutant ?tsiH when Mg2+ or Ca2+ was supplemented. Transcriptome and genetic analyses demonstrate that the metal-sensing PhoPQ two-component system is important for Mg2+-dependent sensitivity. Competition analysis in infant mice shows that TseH was active under in vivo conditions. Using a panel of V. cholerae single-effector active mutants, we further show that E. coli also exhibited variable susceptibilities to other T6SS effectors depending on cations and temperatures, respectively. Lastly, V. cholerae effector VasX could sensitize Pseudomonas aeruginosa to its intrinsically resistant antibiotic irgasan in a temperature-dependent manner.

However, the adverse impact of the pandemic is more seen in the low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although there is evidence on the adverse impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the health of mothers and neonates, the evidence is mainly from high-income countries. For reducing the mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19 in LMICs, there is a need to generate evidence from the LMICs. The present study is a part of the National Registry of pregnant women with COVID-19 in India (PregCovid registry). Our study demonstrates a higher risk of adverse outcomes such as neonatal sepsis and death in the SARS-CoV-2 infected as compared to the non-infected neonates. The study also showed the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 6.3% of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: We describe the clinical characteristics, management, and short-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of 524 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 admitted from 14(th) April 2020 to 31(st) July 2020. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 6.3% of the newborns of the mothers with COVID-19. No significant differences were observed between maturity at gestation, birth weight and sex of SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected newborns. The risk of sepsis was 4.09 (95% CI,1.28-13.00) fold higher in the neonates with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the non-infected group (p = 0.031). Poor feeding was significantly more common among SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates (12.1%) as compared to the non-infected neonates (2.7%) (p = 0.017). There was a total of 13 neonatal deaths, of which 3 deaths occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates (9%) while 10 (3%) in the SAR-CoV-2 negative group. The risk of neonatal death was higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected newborns (OR 4.8; 95% CI 1.25-18.36). CONCLUSION: Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is observed in almost 6% of neonates born to mothers with perinatal COVID-19.

In each region of movement performed by any person, the method computes the infection Transmission Rate (ITR) in two time window as before and after. According to the infection rate and ITR value of different region, a subset of sources are selected as vulnerable sources. The method produces higher performance in predicting the vulnerable sources and supports the reduction of infection rate.

Among the various functions of LL-37, its antimicrobial activity is important in controlling the microorganisms of the human body. The target molecules of LL-37 in bacteria include membrane lipids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), proteins, DNA and RNA. In this mini-review, we summarize the entity of LL-37 structural data determined over the last 15 years and specifically discuss features implicated in the interactions with lipid-like molecules. For this purpose, we discuss partial and full-length structures of LL-37 determined in the presence of membrane-mimicking detergents. This constantly growing structural database is now composed of monomers, dimers, tetramers, and fiber-like structures. The diversity of these structures underlines an unexpected plasticity and highlights the conformational and oligomeric adaptability of LL-37 necessary to target different molecular scaffolds. The recent co-crystal structures of LL-37 in complex with detergents are particularly useful to understand how these molecules mimic lipids and LPS to induce oligomerization and fibrillation. Defined detergent binding sites provide deep insights into a new class of peptide scaffolds, widening our view on the fascinating world of the LL-37 structural factotum. Together, the new structures in their evolutionary context allow for the assignment of functionally conserved residues in oligomerization and target interactions. Conserved phenylalanine and arginine residues primarily mediate those interactions with lipids and LPS. The interactions with macromolecules such as proteins or DNA remain largely unexplored and open a field for future studies aimed at structures of LL-37 complexes. These complexes will then allow for the structure-based rational design of LL-37-derived peptides with improved antibiotic properties.","output":"Structural Plasticity of LL-37 Indicates Elaborate Functional Adaptation Mechanisms to Bacterial Target Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Importance: Measuring humoral immunogenicity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines and finding population-level correlates of protection against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents an immediate challenge to public health practitioners. Objective: To study the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of finger prick capillary dried blood spot (DBS) samples tested using an anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and the humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination. Design, Setting and Participants: This cross-sectional study enrolled participants (n= 644) who had paired DBS and serum samples collected by finger prick and venipuncture, respectively, in British Columbia, Canada between January 12th, 2020 and May 21st, 2021. Samples were tested by a multiplex electrochemiluminescence assay for SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike (S), -Nucleocapsid (N) and -receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG reactivity using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Additionally, unpaired DBS samples (n= 6,706) that were collected in the province during the same time period were included for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG reactivity. Exposure: Collection of a capillary DBS by finger prick alone or paired with serum by venipuncture. Outcome: Humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 measured by detection of anti-S, -N or -RBD IgG. Results: In comparison to a paired-serum reference, DBS samples possessed a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 61%-91%) and specificity of 97% (95% CI: 95%-98%). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis (ROC) found that participant DBS samples tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by MSD V-PLEX COVID-19 Coronavirus Panel 2 assay accurately classify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion at an 88% percent rate, AUC= 88% (95% CI: 81%-96%). Modelling found that a DBS-based testing approach has a high positive predictive value (PPV) (98% [95% CI: 98%-99%]) in a theoretical population with seventy-five percent COVID-19 vaccine coverage. At lower vaccine coverages of fifteen and forty-five percent, the test's PPV decreased and the negative predictive value increased. Conclusion: We demonstrate that DBS samples, when tested using an electrochemiluminescence assay, provide a valid alternative to traditional venipuncture and should be considered to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.","output":"Performance of Immunoglobulin G Serology on Finger Prick Capillary Dried Blood Spot Samples to Measure SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Immunogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of severe pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Simultaneously, there was a prevalence of jokes on different social media sites. During the crisis, most Arab countries went through a nationwide lockdown for weeks that people found themselves trapped in their homes and resorted to social media to express their frustration about the prevailing happenings. They began exchanging jokes on social media that indirectly reflected stereotypes about them. One thousand four hundred and twenty-four jokes (1424) were collected from Facebook and WhatsApp messages for three months and were categorized based on the themes they covered. Gender-related jokes ranked the highest and were predominantly targeting women. Hence, this study is an attempt to explore how Arab Women were stereotyped in jokes circulated on social media during the coronavirus crisis. The 508 gender-related jokes were analysed in light of the General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The analysis generated four main themes, namely marital relations (33%), habits and attributes (26%), beauty and makeup (23%), and violence (18%). Women were stereotyped as being ugly and less feminine without makeup, talkative, shopaholic, despising and annoying wives, and violent and harmful partners in their private sphere.

Progress will depend on future advances in prophylactic vaccine activity, including advancement of candidates capable of generating more potent induction of cross-reactive T cells and durable cross-reactive antibody responses. Here we evaluated an Amphiphile (AMP) adjuvant, AMP-CpG, admixed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) immunogen, as a lymph node-targeted protein subunit vaccine (ELI-005) in mice and non-human primates (NHPs). AMP-mediated targeting of CpG DNA to draining lymph nodes resulted in comprehensive local immune activation characterized by extensive transcriptional reprogramming, inflammatory proteomic milieu, and activation of innate immune cells as key orchestrators of antigen-directed adaptive immunity. Prime-boost immunization with AMP-CpG in mice induced potent and durable T cell responses in multiple anatomical sites critical for prophylactic efficacy and prevention of severe disease. Long-lived memory responses were rapidly expanded upon re-exposure to antigen. In parallel, RBD-specific antibodies were long-lived, and exhibited cross-reactive recognition of variant RBD. AMP-CpG-adjuvanted prime-boost immunization in NHPs was safe and well tolerated, while promoting multi-cytokine-producing circulating T cell responses cross-reactive across variants of concern (VOC). Expansion of RBD-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in lymph nodes correlated to rapid seroconversion with variant-specific neutralizing antibody responses exceeding those measured in convalescent human plasma. These results demonstrate the promise of lymph-node adjuvant-targeting to coordinate innate immunity and generate robust adaptive responses critical for vaccine efficacy.","output":"Programming the lymph node immune response with Amphiphile-CpG induces potent cellular and humoral immunity following COVID-19 subunit vaccination in mice and non-human primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence is a significant issue among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Furthermore, income is one of the most consistent predictors of dental visits. Therefore, this study examined the association between income changes and dental clinic visits during the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan. METHODS An online, self-reported cross-sectional survey about health activities including dental visits during the first COVID-19 state of emergency was conducted in Osaka, Japan (June 23 to July 12, 2020). Among participants with toothaches, the assessment for the association between \\"refrained from visiting a dentist despite wanting treatment for toothache during the state of emergency (refrained treatment)\\" and income changes before and after the state of emergency using a multivariate Poisson regression model adjusted for sex, age, self-rated health, frequency of regular dental visits, and employment status. RESULTS Among 27,575 participants, 3,895 (14.1%) had toothaches, and 1,906 (6.9%) reported refrained treatment. Among people with decreased income (n = 8,152, 29.6% of overall participants), the proportions of the refrained treatment group were 8.0% (income decreased by 1%-49%), 9.9% (50%-99% decreased), and 9.1% (100% decreased). Among participants with toothache, after adjusting for all variables, compared with participants with no income change, we observed significantly higher prevalence ratios (PRs) for refrained treatment in those who experienced a decreased income owing to COVID-19 (1%-49% decrease: PR = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.005-1.17; 50%-99% decrease: PR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.32; 100% decrease: PR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33).

It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling MPS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AMPK-PGC-1-SIRT3 axis is associated with depression of mitochondrial function in the rat MPS model. Methods A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group and experimental group. The expression level of mRNA and protein of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. The histopathological findings were investigated through electron microscopes in GM of all groups. Results Our results showed that MPS induces continuous depression of mitochondrial biogenesis and function via down-regulation of PGC-1-SIRT3 axis accompanying with ATP fuel crisis as compared to control group. However, the expression level of SIRT3 mRNA did not change. Additionally, a correlated reduction of the mRNA and protein expression level of NRF-1 and TFAM, known as the downstream target of PGC-1, suggesting further transcription of nuclear genes encoding mitochondria functional proteins for promoting mitochondria proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation and energy production is continuously depressed. Furthermore, phosphorylation extent of AMPK is also declined following MPS, and it is negatively correlated with reduction of ATP generation, suggesting that the complex network involves different inhibition in transcription, post-translational modification and a plethora of other effectors that mediate the inhibition roles. Conclusion We here suggested that the down-regulation in AMPK-PGC-1-SIRT3 axis network may be the basis for the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and MPS, where a vicious circle further aggravates the disease symptoms with ongoing ATP energy crisis.","output":"Depression of Mitochondrial Function in the Rat Skeletal Muscle Model of Myofascial Pain Syndrome Is Through Down-Regulation of the AMPK-PGC-1-SIRT3 Axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During COVID-19 lockdown the enforced social isolation and other pandemic-related changes highly increased the risk of mental health problems.

METHODS: This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (M = 68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. RESULTS: Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health.

Then, as our main model of interest, we use a fixed effect difference-in-differences model to provide more robust evidence. RESULTS: Since the beginning of the crisis, both levels of hedonic and evaluative well-being have decreased as a result of the pandemic and lockdown. However, for those living in more deprived neighbourhoods the level of hedonic well-being decreased more than for those living in better areas. We found no such difference for evaluative well-being.

The studies examined coping and post-traumatic stress in the wake of acute onset disasters such as terrorist events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Greater PTSS symptoms were related to internalizing, externalizing, rumination, and avoidant coping strategies. Coping measurement was constrained due to measurement variance, lack of developmentally and contextually vali-dated instruments, theoretical misalignment, and absence of comprehensive tools to assess coping.

Mass spectroscopic analysis of N protein identified phosphorylation sites that were proximal to RNA binding domains. Kinetic analysis, by surface plasmon resonance, indicated that nonphosphorylated N protein bound with the same affinity to viral RNA as phosphorylated N protein. However, phosphorylated N protein bound to viral RNA with a higher binding affinity than nonviral RNA, suggesting that phosphorylation of N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA. The data also indicated that a known N protein binding site (involved in transcriptional regulation) consisting of a conserved core sequence present near the 5' end of the genome (in the leader sequence) functioned by promoting high association rates of N protein binding. Further analysis of the leader sequence indicated that the core element was not the only binding site for N protein and that other regions functioned to promote high-affinity binding.","output":"Mass spectroscopic characterization of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus nucleoprotein and elucidation of the role of phosphorylation in RNA binding by using surface plasmon resonance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Une mortalit  plus de 40 % a t rapporte chez les patients intubs se compliquant de CPAVM.

Studies in mouse and baboon models have demonstrated that Th1 and Th17 responses are integral to protective immunity induced by previous infection with B. pertussis and immunization with whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccines. Mucosal Th17 cells, IL-17 and secretory IgA (sIgA) are particularly important in generating sustained sterilizing immunity in the nasal cavity. Current aP vaccines induce potent IgG and Th2-skewed T cell responses but are less effective at generating Th1 and Th17 responses and fail to prime respiratory tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells, that maintain long-term immunity at mucosal sites. In contrast, a live attenuated pertussis vaccine, pertussis outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines or aP vaccines formulated with novel adjuvants do induce cellular immune responses in the respiratory tract, especially when delivered by the intranasal route. An increased understanding of the mechanisms of sustained protective immunity, especially the role of respiratory T(RM) cells, will facilitate the development of next generation pertussis vaccines that not only protect against pertussis disease, but prevent nasal colonization and transmission of B. pertussis.","output":"Next-Generation Pertussis Vaccines Based on the Induction of Protective T Cells in the Respiratory Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending uses two-sided platforms to link borrowers with a crowd of lenders.

New policies led to major changes in the lifestyle of millions of citizens all around the world and will permanently affect their travel behaviour. This paper aims to investigate and analyse the impact of teleworking on transportation habits, focusing on walking and commuting before and during the pandemic. Data regarding the walking frequency fluctuations due to teleworking were collected through structured questionnaires in Sicily, Italy. Most respondents seem to believe that it can be a factor leading to a decrease in their walking trips and to a change in their associated walking habits and behaviour. In this study, the rebound effects of telecommuting with respect to vehicle usage are taken into consideration. Although, it can result in a smaller number of trips weekly, the net amount of distance travelled per person can be larger, as employees are more willing to commute farther considering they will not commute as often. However, for longer distances, people tend to use trains since it allows working while commuting. This can result in reduced traffic, especially at peak times and consequently have a positive social and environmental impact, less stress and less air and noise pollution from private vehicles. An increasing number of companies is announcing the decision of pivoting to teleworking even after the pandemic is over. Policy makers and urban planners can use telecommuting as a tool that contributes to relieving traffic and seek ways to introduce a more sustainable future of work and mobility in the post-pandemic world.","output":"Impact of Teleworking on Travel Behaviour During the COVID-19 Era: The Case Of Sicily, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a pathological condition that causes a variety of neurological symptoms due to narrowing of the anatomical structures; usually, conservative treatment is recommended, rather than surgical treatment. Acupotomy combines conventional acupuncture with small scalpels; the procedure can be considered minimally invasive, and has recently received considerable attention in clinical practice. Still, there is a lack of data and randomized controlled trials regarding acupotomy related to LSS. Additional studies are necessary, considering the low methodological quality and small size of the study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, pilot, randomized controlled trial. The trial comprises 8 weeks of treatment, with 16 visits and a 4-week follow-up period. Forty participants diagnosed with LSS will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups; both groups will receive acupuncture and interferential current therapy twice a week for 8 weeks, while the experimental group will receive an additional acupotomy intervention once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be assessed using the visual analog scale; the secondary outcome will be measured by self-rated walking distance, Oswestry Disability Index, and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Measurements will be obtained prior to the start of the clinical trial, 4 weeks after the interventional procedure, 8 weeks after the procedure, and 4 weeks after the end of the interventional procedure. Blood tests and adverse reactions will be performed to ensure safety of the treatments. CONCLUSION: We expect that this study will provide basic data for future large-scale acupotomy studies regarding LSS.","output":"Effectiveness and safety of acupotomy on lumbar spinal stenosis: A pragmatic randomized, controlled, pilot clinical trial: A study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Editorial Board have prepared a podcast describing their experiences over the past year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study examined Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence and risk factors among a representative sample of 18-49-year-old residents in Hong Kong. METHODS: Census boundary map of 412 constituency areas was used as primary sampling units to construct the sampling frame and, residential buildings and units were randomly selected using geospatial modelling. A questionnaire on sexual practice and health was conducted, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test the urine for genital chlamydial infection. Invitation letters were sent to the selected households and a team of interviewers were sent to recruit one subject per household. Prevalence data was weighted according to the 2011 census and risk factors identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 881 participants (response rate of 24.5%), the overall Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was low at 1.4% (95%CI 0.8C2.5%) but sexually active young (18C26 years) women had relatively high prevalence (5.8%, 95%CI 1.7C18.2%) in Hong Kong. A unique U-shape disease burden was observed with peaks in younger and older (40C49 years) women. Amongst the sexually active women, the risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were: younger age (aOR = 25.4, 95% CI 2.81C230); living alone (aOR = 8.99, 95% CI 1.46C55.40); and, among all the sexually active participants, males (including the male partners of the female participants) who had travelled out of Hong Kong in the previous 12 months had higher risks of infection (aOR = 5.35; 95% CI 1.25C22.8). A core-peripheral geographical distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis prevalence was also observed. CONCLUSION: Young and older sexually active women in Hong Kong have high prevalence of chlamydia. Routine screening for sexually active women and young men should be considered.

However, individual social contact data and population mobility data can offer near real-time proxy information. The aim of this study is to compare social contact data and population mobility data with respect to their ability to reflect transmission dynamics during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: We quantified the change in social contact patterns derived from self-reported contact survey data collected by the German COVIMOD study from 04/2020 to 06/2020 (compared to the pre-pandemic period from previous studies) and estimated the percentage mean reduction over time. We compared these results as well as the percentage mean reduction in population mobility data (corrected for pre-pandemic mobility) with and without the introduction of scaling factors and specific weights for different types of contacts and mobility to the relative reduction in transmission dynamics measured by changes in R values provided by the German Public Health Institute. RESULTS: We observed the largest reduction in social contacts (90%, compared to pre-pandemic data) in late April corresponding to the strictest contact reduction measures. Thereafter, the reduction in contacts dropped continuously to a minimum of 73% in late June. Relative reduction of infection dynamics derived from contact survey data underestimated the one based on reported R values in the time of strictest contact reduction measures but reflected it well thereafter. Relative reduction of infection dynamics derived from mobility data overestimated the one based on reported R values considerably throughout the study. After the introduction of a scaling factor, specific weights for different types of contacts and mobility reduced the mean absolute percentage error considerably; in all analyses, estimates based on contact data reflected measured R values better than those based on mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Contact survey data reflected infection dynamics better than population mobility data, indicating that both data sources cover different dimensions of infection dynamics. The use of contact type-specific weights reduced the mean absolute percentage errors to less than 1%. Measuring the changes in mobility alone is not sufficient for understanding the changes in transmission dynamics triggered by public health measures.

Upregulated activity of RR plays an active role in tumor progression. As the regulatory subunit of RR, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is regarded as one of the effective therapeutic targets for DNA replication-dependent diseases, such as cancers. Recent studies have revealed that osalmid significantly inhibits the activity of RRM2, but the metabolic profile of osalmid remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the metabolic profile including metabolites, isoenzymes and metabolic pathways of osalmid. The anti-human hepatocellular carcinoma activity and mechanism of metabolites were further investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was used for identifying metabolites and for characterizing phase I and phase II metabolic pathways with recombinant enzymes or in human liver microsomes of osalmid. The eHiTS docking system was used for potential RRM2 inhibitor screening among metabolites. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for evaluating cell proliferation inhibitory activity of metabolites. Cell cycle assays and cell apoptosis assays were assessed by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis of RRM2, cyclin D1, p21, p53, phosphorylated p53, Bcl-2 and Bax was performed to explore the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma mechanism of the active metabolites. RESULTS: Ten metabolites of osalmid were identified, and none of them have been reported previously. Hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation, acetylation and degradation were recognized as the main metabolic processes of osalmid. Isozymes of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were involved in phase I and phase II metabolism of osalmid. Metabolites M7, M8 and M10 showed higher binding affinities with the RRM2 active site than osalmid. Metabolite M7 exhibited potent inhibitory activity to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by both competitive inhibition and down-regulation of RRM2. Moreover, M7 significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic profile of osalmid was identified. M7 significantly inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma progression by inhibiting RRM2 activity. Furthermore, M7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related signaling pathways.","output":"Identification of osalmid metabolic profile and active metabolites with anti-tumor activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIGNIFICANCE: SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, affects every aspect of human life by challenging bodily, socio-economic and political systems at unprecedented levels. As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multi-systems disease that disturbs whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualise how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate and accommodate stress. CRITICAL ISSUES: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multi-organ/multi-level interdependencies. Host/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven 'oxidative storm' alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at individual and population level. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: While inflicting considerable damage to health and wellbeing, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. 'Redox phenotyping' of patients to characterise whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.","output":"COVID-19 - A Redox Disease What a Stress Pandemic Can Teach Us About Resilience and What We May Learn from the Reactive Species Interactome About its Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The newly identified human bocavirus (HBoV), a member of the Parvoviridae family, has been associated to low respiratory tract infections in young children.

This study evaluated their properties in detecting compromised nutrition and guiding perioperative management of esophageal cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective institutional database of esophageal cancer patients was reviewed and analyzed. Compromised nutritional status was defined as PNI < 50, NRI < 97.5, GNRI < 92, or CONUT score  4, respectively. The malnutrition diagnosis consensus established by the European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN 2015) was selected as reference. Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used. External validation was conducted. RESULTS: After reviewing the 212-patient database, 192 patients were finally included. Among the four nutritional indexes, the GNRI < 92 showed highest sensitivity (72.0%), specificity (78.9%), and consistency (AUC 0.754, 95% CI 0.672C0.836) with malnutrition diagnosed by ESPEN 2015. The GNRI < 92 showed comparable performance with ESPEN 2015 in recognizing decreased fat mass, fat-free mass, and skeletal muscle mass (all P < 0.01). Both the GNRI < 92 and ESPEN 2015 showed good property in predicting major complications, infectious complications, overall complications and delayed hospital discharge (all P < 0.01), better than PNI < 50, NRI < 97.5, and CONUT score  4. Regarding the external validation, a retrospective analysis of 155 esophageal cancer patients confirmed the better performance of GNRI < 92 in predicting perioperative morbidities than other 3 nutritional indexes.

(1) PEMF stimulation group (PEMF group, n = 24): intravenously injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 g/kg) on day 0 and intramuscularly injected with methylprednisolone acetate (MPSL, 20 mg/kg) on days 1, 2 and 3, then subjected to PEMF stimulation 4 h per day for 1 to 8 weeks. (2) Methylprednisolone-treated group (MPSL group, n = 24): injected the same dose of LPS and MPSL as the PEMF group but without exposure to PEMF. (3) Control group (PS group, n = 24): injected 0.9% saline in the same mode at the same time points. The incidence of osteonecrosis, serum lipid levels and the mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) in the proximal femur were measured 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the last MPSL (or saline) injection. RESULTS: The incidence of osteonecrosis in the PEMF group (29%) was significantly lower than that observed in the MPSL group (75%), while no osteonecrosis was observed in the PS group. The serum lipid levels were significantly lower in the PEMF and PS groups than in the MPSL group. Compared with the MPSL and PS groups, the mRNA expression of TGF-1 increased, reaching a peak 1 week after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 4 weeks, then declined at 8 weeks, whereas the protein expression of TGF-1 increased, reaching a peak at 2 weeks after PEMF treatment, and remained high for 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: PEMF stimulation can prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats, and the underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased expression of TGF-1.","output":"Pulsed electromagnetic fields stimulation prevents steroid-induced osteonecrosis in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical face-to-face learning sessions were switched to online learning mode. However, the effectiveness of online learning for a developing country such as Indonesia is constrained by its digital education readiness, especially financial support, infrastructure, culture, and skills. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effectiveness of online learning by progressive analysis of the gap between offline and online learning methods. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) is applied to weigh the preferences of indicators set as criteria for measuring online learning efficacy. Meanwhile, Profile Matching is used to calculate the gap between both learning conditions during pre-and post-pandemic. The performance of fifty students at Faculty Economic and Social Universitas Islam Negeri Sultan Syarif Kasim Riau (FESUIN) was used as a case study. This paper revealed that students' grade point average (GPA) was the highest weighted criterion for student learning performance. It is followed by electricity resources, signal quality, learning-supported devices, and internet quotes. Thus, the value gap distinguished the potential of the face-to-face learning mode compared to online learning. The analysis shows that offline learning is the more effective learning method for this case. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"The Identification of Student Learning Gap: Integrated Analytics Using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process and Profile Matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amphipathic peptide has been engineered and is capable of penetrating the bloodCbrain barrier as well as possessing a potent antiviral activity against Zika and other mosquito-borne viruses.","output":"Targeting vesicle size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FANCJ, a DNA helicase and interacting partner of the tumor suppressor BRCA1, is crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL), a highly toxic lesion that leads to chromosomal instability and perturbs normal transcription. In diploid cells, FANCJ is believed to operate in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB); however, its precise role and molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Moreover, compensatory mechanisms of ICL resistance when FANCJ is deficient have not been explored. In this work, we conducted a siRNA screen to identify genes of the DNA damage response/DNA repair regime that when acutely depleted sensitize FANCJ CRISPR knockout cells to a low concentration of the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). One of the top hits from the screen was RAP80, a protein that recruits repair machinery to broken DNA ends and regulates DNA end-processing. Concomitant loss of FANCJ and RAP80 not only accentuates DNA damage levels in human cells but also adversely affects the cell cycle checkpoint, resulting in profound chromosomal instability. Genetic complementation experiments demonstrated that both FANCJ's catalytic activity and interaction with BRCA1 are important for ICL resistance when RAP80 is deficient. The elevated RPA and RAD51 foci in cells co-deficient of FANCJ and RAP80 exposed to MMC are attributed to single-stranded DNA created by Mre11 and CtIP nucleases. Altogether, our cell-based findings together with biochemical studies suggest a critical function of FANCJ to suppress incompletely processed and toxic joint DNA molecules during repair of ICL-induced DNA damage.","output":"FANCJ compensates for RAP80 deficiency and suppresses genomic instability induced by interstrand cross-links."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: FGFR genetic aberrations (GAs) occur in an estimated 10% to 16% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs). The natural history of CCA with FGFR GAs, the prognostic role of coexisting GAs, and the outcome with FGFR-targeted inhibitors are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CCA with FGFR GAs were identified using next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization from four tertiary cancer centers and compared with FGFR wild-type counterparts. Data reviewed included demographic, treatment, overall survival (OS), and GA data. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier plots, and log-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Three hundred seventy-seven patients with CCA were identified, and 95 had FGFR GAs. FGFR2 GA was most common (n = 74, with 63 fusions) and seen in intrahepatic CCA. In patients with CCA, FGFR GAs occurred more frequently in younger patients ( 40 years; 20%) compared with older patients (> 40 years; 6.7%; P < .001), presented at an earlier stage (TNM stage I/II v III/IV: 35.8% v 22%, respectively; P = .001), and were associated with a longer OS compared with patients without FGFR GAs (37 v 20 months, respectively; P < .001). This difference remained significant after excluding 36 patients treated with FGFR inhibitors. There was no OS difference (P = .60) between CCA with FGFR2 fusions (n = 63) versus other FGFR GAs (n = 29). Patients with FGFR GAs had a better OS with FGFR-targeted therapy compared with standard treatment (P = .01). BAP1 mutation was the most common coexisting mutation without prognostic impact, whereas TP53 (P = .04) and CDKN2A/B (P = .04) were correlated with a shorter OS. CONCLUSION: CCA with FGFR GAs represents a unique subtype occurring in younger patients with an indolent disease course.

Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities;however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of -0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81, and -0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic.

This requires adequate nutritious food with appropriate amounts of macro- and micronutrients. Currently, a well-established system for infant food is enforced by the regulatory bodies, but no clear system exists for complementary food, which is consumed by children from the age of 6 month to 24 months. As the child grows beyond 6 months, the need for nutrients increases, and if the nutritional needs are not fulfilled, it can lead to health problems, such as stunted growth, weak immune system, and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is important to have regulatory bodies monitoring complementary food in a similar capacity as is required for infant formula. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the existing regulatory bodies, such as the Codex Alimentarius, International Standard Organization (ISO), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), etc., and their regulations specifically for infant formula that can be adopted for complementary foods.

A key question is whether it is possible to make rational predictions of new therapies based on the presently available scientific and medical information. In this regard, I have noticed an omission in the present analysis in the literature related to the exploitation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) as a therapeutic approach. This is based on two key observations, that GSK-3 inhibitors can simultaneously block SARs viral replication, while boosting CD8+ adaptive T-cell and innate natural killer (NK) responses. Firstly, it is already clear that GSK-3 phosphorylation of SARs CoV1 N protein on key serine residues is needed for viral replication such that small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of GSK-3 can inhibit viral replication. In comparing protein sequences, I show here that the key sites in the N protein of SARs CoV1 N for replication are conserved in SARs CoV2. This strongly suggests that GSK-3 SMIs will also inhibit SARs Cov2 replication. Secondly, we and others have previously documented that GSK-3 SMIs markedly enhance CD8+ cytolytic T-cell (CTL) and NK cell anti-viral effector functions leading to a reduction in both acute and chronic viral infections in mice. My hypothesis is that the repurposing of low-cost inhibitors of GSK-3 such as lithium will limit SARS-CoV2 infections by both reducing viral replication and potentiating the immune response against the virus. To date, there has been no mention of this dual connection between GSK-3 and SARs CoV2 in the literature. To my knowledge, no other drugs exist with the potential to simultaneously target both viral replication and immune response against SARs CoV2.","output":"GSK-3 Inhibition as a Therapeutic Approach Against SARs CoV2: Dual Benefit of Inhibiting Viral Replication While Potentiating the Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In zoos, primates experience markedly different interactions with familiar humans, such as the zookeepers who care for them, compared with those with unfamiliar humans, such as the large volume of zoo visitors to whom they are regularly exposed.

Using a dot-probe paradigm, we assessed whether primates (chimpanzees and gorillas) show an attentional bias toward the faces of familiar humans, with whom the apes presumably had a positive relationship. Contrary to our predictions, all subjects showed a significant attentional bias toward unfamiliar people's faces compared with familiar people's faces when the faces showed a neutral expression, both with and without a surgical face mask on, but no significant attentional bias when the faces showed a surprised expression. These results demonstrate that apes can spontaneously categorize humans based on familiarity and we argue that the attentional biases the apes showed for unfamiliar human faces reflect a novelty effect.","output":"Familiarity mediates apes' attentional biases toward human faces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is lack of clarity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB)--including the role of nocturnal hypoxia and confounding influence of obesity--on the clinical course of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We postulate that SDB portends increased risk of adverse COVID-19 clinical outcomes even after accounting for confounding factors. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 and sleep laboratory observational registries March-November 2020 within the Cleveland Clinic health system was performed. Ordinal logistic regression assessed the association of SDB indices and World Health Organization (WHO)-7 COVID-19 clinical outcome (hospitalization, use of supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation/ECMO and death) in an unadjusted model and adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index(BMI,kg/m2),diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer and smoking using SAS software. RESULTS: Of 19,449 (32%) patients positive for SARS-CoV-2,2,290 (6%) had an available sleep study. The analytic sample included 1788 of which 1,484(64%) had an apnea hypopnea index (AHI, 3C4% hypopnea oxygen desaturation)5. The median duration from sleep study to COVID test was 5.8 years (IQR:3.3C9.0). Age was 56.514.4 years,50.4% female,28% African American with BMI=35.98.9kg/m2. Nine percent of patients were hospitalized,10% with supplemental oxygen,6% used non-invasive ventilation,2% required ECMO or mechanical ventilation and 2% died. For every AHI increase of 5, the odds of a higher WHO-7 level increased 2% (OR=1.02,95%CI1.01-1.04,p=0.005),but the association was mitigated in the adjusted model (OR=1.00,95%CI:0.98,1.02,p=0.80). Per 5% increase in time spent with SaO2<90%, the odds of a higher WHO-7 level increased 10% (OR=1.10,95%CI1.06-1.13,p=<0.001) persisting in the adjusted model(OR=1.06,95%CI:1.02C1.10,p=0.002). For every decrease of 5% mean SaO2, the odds of a higher level WHO-7 increased 56% (OR=0.56,95%CI:0.46C0.67,p<0.001) persisting in the adjusted model(OR=0.72,95%CI:0.58C0.89,p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Even after adjustment for obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease and smoking, sleep-related hypoxemia was a potential key pathophysiologic mechanism associated with increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elucidation of sleep-related hypoxemia as a risk stratification measure, particularly given the silent hypoxia inherent to early COVID-19, is critical for future investigation, as is the role of sleep-related hypoxia reversal as a target to improve COVID-19 outcomes.

Using STATA V.14 for analysis, the authors pooled the overall prevalence of men and/or women using a random-effect meta-analysis model. The authors examined the heterogeneity in effect size using Q statistics and I2 statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was also checked. PARTICIPANTS: Studies on COVID-19 confirmed cases were included. INTERVENTION: Sex (male/female) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was considered. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 among men and women. RESULTS: A total of 57 studies with 221 195 participants were used in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among men was found to be 55.00 (51.43-56.58, I2=99.5%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed the findings were not dependent on a single study.

METHOD: An electronic survey, endorsed by the Paediatric Critical Care Society (PCCS), was designed and reported in accordance with CHERRIES guidelines. The survey was distributed by email to all UK/Ireland Nurse Managers and Medical/ Nursing Research leads, aiming for one response per site during the period of April-June 2021. Only one response per site was included in analysis. RESULTS: 44 responses were received, representing 24/30 UK/Ireland sites (80% response rate). Responses from n = 21/30 units are included (three excluded for insufficient data). 90% (n = 19/21) units were research active, although only 52% (n = 11) had permanent research roles funded within their staffing establishment.

The absence of cross-reactivity and any mutations in target regions of the assay used would provide a higher degree of confidence in the CRISPR-based diagnostic tests being developed while the presence could help guide the assay development efforts.

The lack of such common standards combined with unfriendly interfaces make it difficult for biologists to learn how to use these tools and to translate the data formats from one to another. Consequently, the construction of an integrative bioinformatics platform to facilitate biologists research is an urgent and challenging task. KDE Bioscience is a java-based software platform that collects a variety of bioinformatics tools and provides a workflow mechanism to integrate them. Nucleotide and protein sequences from local flat files, web sites, and relational databases can be entered, annotated, and aligned. Several home-made or 3rd-party viewers are built-in to provide visualization of annotations or alignments. KDE Bioscience can also be deployed in client-server mode where simultaneous execution of the same workflow is supported for multiple users. Moreover, workflows can be published as web pages that can be executed from a web browser. The power of KDE Bioscience comes from the integrated algorithms and data sources. With its generic workflow mechanism other novel calculations and simulations can be integrated to augment the current sequence analysis functions. Because of this flexible and extensible architecture, KDE Bioscience makes an ideal integrated informatics environment for future bioinformatics or systems biology research.","output":"KDE Bioscience: Platform for bioinformatics analysis workflows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic status, authors from the most severely affected countries have reported reduced rates of hospital admissions for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on hospital admissions and outcomes in ACS patients in a single high-volume centre in southeastern Europe. METHODS: This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the number of hospital admissions for ACS, clinical findings at admission, length of hospitalisation, major complications and in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak and to compare the data with the same parameters during an equivalent time frame in 2019. For the ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) subgroup of patients, changes in ischaemic times were analysed as well. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of 44.3% in the number of patients admitted for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak when compared with the same period in 2019 (151 vs 271; 95% confidence interval 38.4C50.2, p < 0.01) with a higher mortality rate (13.2% vs 7.2%, p = 0.03). In 2020, patients with non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction presented more often with acute heart failure (3.3% vs 0.7%, p = 0.04). During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed increases in the total ischaemic time (303  163.4 vs 200.8  156.8 min, p < 0.05) and door-to-balloon time (69.2  58.4 vs 50.5  31.3 min, p < 0.01) in STEMI patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should increase the awareness of morbidity and mortality related to missed or delayed treatment of ACS among the public and the healthcare services.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on hospital admissions and outcome of acute coronary syndromes in a single high-volume centre in southeastern Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperventilation (HV) is one of the main and basic activation methods during ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), unless medical reasons contraindicate it. During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, with the high risk of human\\\\to\\\\human infection, local guidelines and recommendations have been developed that suggest not to perform the HV maneuver routinely. Our objective was to characterize patients who present positive HV in an epilepsy center. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all the ambulatory EEGs performed during one year in our specialized ambulatory child and adolescent epilepsy center, and describe patients with positive maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 305 EEGs were performed. Patients under 3 years and 11 months were excluded as well as all patients that did not fill up the criteria for epilepsy diagnosis. From the 252 EEGs that were included in the study, 194 EEGs (77%) were classified as abnormal and 58 (23%) as normal. From these same 252 EEGs, 150 EEG finished correctly the HV maneuver. Physiological slowing response was found in 54 EEGs (36%), no changes (negative) in 83 (55%), and abnormal response (positive) in 13 EEGs (9%). The 13 HV\\\\positive EEGs showed 4 patients with an increase of epileptiform activity, 3 patients experienced an increase of basal preregistered abnormal slowing, and 6 EEGs showed trigger of bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2\\\\4 Hz spike\\\\and\\\\slow wave discharges and absences. None of these last 6 patients needed more than 3 minutes to elicit the paroxysmal discharge. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings and according with other studies, the low positivity and high specificity of the HV maneuver support the idea that HV could be excluded during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic situation, and also reevaluate whether it could be changed to a complementary maneuver, restricted only for cases where absence epilepsy is suspected. Larger studies will be needed to reaffirm this proposal.","output":"Hyperventilation maneuver during EEG in children with epilepsy after the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Further, we assessed the CXR-US correlation to explore the role of ultrasound in monitoring the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical features and CXR scores were obtained at admission and correlated with the level of intensity of care required [high- (HIMC) versus low-intensity medical care (LIMC)]. In a subgroup of patients, US findings were correlated with clinical and radiographic parameters. On hospital admission, CXR global score was higher in HIMCs compared to LIMC. Smoking history, pO(2) on admission, cardiovascular and oncologic diseases were independent predictors of HIMC. The US score was positively correlated with FiO(2) while the correlation with CXR global score only trended towards significance. Our study identifies clinical and radiographic features that strongly correlate with higher levels of medical care.

In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could enhance the epidemiological investigation of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Methods and findingsFrom 17-November-2020 to 5-January-2021, 803 inpatients and 329 staff were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection across four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK. We classified cases according to epidemiological definitions, sought epidemiological evidence of a potential source for each nosocomial infection, and evaluated if epidemiologically-linked cases had genomic evidence supporting transmission. We compared epidemiological and genomic outbreak identification. Using national epidemiological definitions, 109/803 (14%) inpatient infections were classified as definite/probable nosocomial, 615 (77%) as community-acquired and 79 (10%) as indeterminate. There was strong epidemiological evidence to support definite/probable cases as nosocomial: 107/109 (98%) had a prior-negative PCR in the same hospital stay before testing positive, and 101(93%) shared time and space with known infected patients/staff. Many indeterminate cases were likely infected in hospital: 53/79 (67%) had a prior-negative PCR and 75 (95%) contact with a potential source. 89/615 (11% of all 803 patients) with apparent community-onset had a recent hospital exposure. WGS highlighted SARS-CoV-2 is mainly imported into hospitals: within 764 samples sequenced 607 genomic clusters were identified (>1 SNP distinct). Only 43/607 (7%) clusters contained evidence of onward transmission (subsequent cases within []1 SNP). 20/21 epidemiologically-identified outbreaks contained multiple genomic introductions. Most (80%) nosocomial acquisition occurred in rapid super-spreading events in settings with a mix of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Hospitals not routinely admitting COVID-19 patients had low rates of transmission. Undiagnosed/unsequenced individuals prevent genomic data from excluding nosocomial acquisition. ConclusionsOur findings suggest current surveillance definitions underestimate nosocomial acquisition and reveal most nosocomial transmission occurs from a relatively limited number of highly infectious individuals.","output":"Enhancing epidemiological investigation of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection with whole genome sequencing: A retrospective cohort study across four hospitals in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer death and disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Black patients.

Still, limited research exists on the partial effects of each component of such interventions, and whether participants choose to use all of the features of a program. The objective of this study was to test the individual components of a fully-featured digital health lifestyle intervention as predictors of weight loss in a single statistical model. Methods: Participants in the study (N=25,273) were enrolled in the Livongo for Weight Loss program as part of their employee wellness benefit across 57 states/territories of the US from April, 2019 to January, 2021. Participants received a cellular-connected scale to use daily in the program; they were asked to track their eating via the app and physical activity via smartphones or wearables. Additionally, participants could engage with coaches voluntarily or by receiving feedback from coaches on their recorded food logs. A mixed-effects generalized linear model was used to test the effects of scale usage, physical activity, human telephonic coaching, and food logs without and without coaching feedback on the percent weight loss the following month. Predictors were disaggregated into between- and within-subject components to understand the impact of each component relative to ones own mean. The month in the program and whether or not that month occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic were entered as time-varying covariates. Baseline age, gender, and BMI were entered as time-invariant covariates. Results: Participants were 45% male and had average age of 54.3 years old (SD =11.4), with an average BMI of 33.10 kg/m(2) (SD: 6.2). On average, participants were enrolled in the program for 10.4 months (SD: 5.1). Each additional use of the scale above ones own average was associated with an overall 7.4% weight loss (z=21.06,p<0.001). Similarly, each additional minute of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) above ones own average was associated with an overall 2.4% weight loss (z=3.14, p<0.01). Lastly, coaching and food logging with coaching feedback at a frequency above ones own average were associated with approximately a 6% weight loss throughout the program (z=3.08 and 2.35, respectively; p<0.05 for both). Conclusion: We found that frequency of use of a scale in a weight loss intervention was most predictive of weight loss, followed by human coaching interaction and physical activity. However, food logging without feedback did not significantly impact weight loss among participants. Additional work is needed to understand drivers associated with increased utilization of beneficial program features, including optimizing the use of coaching, which offers great benefit, but may be costly to scale.","output":"Engagement in a Multi-Feature Digital Health Lifestyle Change Program as a Predictor of Weight Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Authorized vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 remain less available in low- and middle-income countries due to insufficient supply, high costs, and storage requirements.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were higher in critical care cases than in mild cases(all P<0.05). Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P<0.05).

METHODS A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). RESULTS The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia.

The fusion domain (FD) of viral glycoproteins is well established as facilitating the initiation of membrane fusion. An improved understanding of the structural plasticity associated with these highly conserved regions aids in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that drive viral fusion. Within the spike protein, the FD of SARS-CoV-2 exists immediately following S2 cleavage at the N-terminus of the S2 domain. Here we have shown that following the introduction of a membrane at pH 7.4, the FD undergoes a transition from a random coil to a more structurally well-defined postfusion state. Furthermore, we have classified the domain into two distinct regions, a fusion peptide (FP, S(816)CG(838)) and a fusion loop (FL, D(839)CF(855)). The FP forms a helixCturnChelix motif upon association with a membrane, and the favorable entropy gained during this transition from a random coil is likely the driving force behind membrane insertion. Membrane depth experiments then revealed the FP is found inserted within the membrane below the lipid headgroups, while the interaction of the FL with the membrane is shallower in nature. Thus, we propose a structural model relevant to fusion at the plasma membrane in which the FP inserts itself just below the phospholipid headgroups and the FL lays upon the lipid membrane surface.","output":"Identifying Distinct Structural Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Fusion Domain Essential for Membrane Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Overview of bladder cancer (BC) management in Italy during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) with head to head comparison of the data from March 2019, considered \\"usual activity\\" period.

Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection nor any approved drug for the treatment. The development of a new drug is time-consuming and cannot be relied on as a solution in combatting the immediate global challenge. In such a situation, the drug repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of COVID-19 treatment by existing drugs, which are approved for other indications. Here, we review the potential use of rapamycin, an mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) inhibitor that can be repurposed at low dosages for the treatment of COVID-19. Rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis, delays aging, reduces obesity in animal models, and inhibits activities or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6 and, IL-10. Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication. Therefore, by drug repurposing, low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential treatment of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Rapamycin as a potential repurpose drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Introduction Le 16 mars 2020, devant ltat durgence sanitaire dcrt en France, le gouvernement a impos des mesures de confinement dont limpact sur lactivit de chirurgie orthopdique et traumatologique reste  dmontrer.

Therefore, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) may complicate the course of the disease. The aim of the current article was to investigate possible predictive factors for bacterial VAP on a retrospective manner, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated CoViD-19 patients. Additionally, determinant factors of lethality were analyzed. METHODS: Medical records of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU) at the university hospital UZ Brussel during the epidemic were reviewed. VAP was defined following the National Healthcare Safety Network 2017 criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among the 39 patients included in the study, 54% were diagnosed with bacterial VAP. Case fatality rate was 44%, but 59% of the deceased patients had a do-not-resuscitate status. Multivariate logistic regression for prediction of VAP showed significant differences in duration of ICU hospitalization and in minimal lung compliance. Additional analyses were performed on CoViD-19 patients who were affected by bacterial respiratory superinfection. The responsible pathogens correspond to the commonly found bacteria in VAP. However, 71% of the isolated germs were multi-drug resistant and bacteraemia was reported in 38%. Multivariate analyses for prediction of lethality found significant difference in SOFA score. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanically ventilated CoViD-19 patients might frequently develop VAP. Longer ICU hospitalization was associated with pulmonary superinfection in the current cohort. Moreover, decreased minimal lung compliance was correlated to VAP and higher SOFA score at VAP diagnosis was associated with lethality.","output":"Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in coronavirus 2019 disease, a retrospective monocentric cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: To cope with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, state and local health officials need information on the effectiveness of policies aimed at curbing contagion, as well as area-specific socio-demographic characteristics that can portend vulnerability to the disease. Objective: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders, African American population in the state, state poverty and other state socio-demographic characteristics, were associated with the state-level incidence of COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, Participants: State-level, aggregated, publicly available data on positive COVID-19 cases and tests were used. The period considered was March 1st -May 4th. All U.S. states except Washington were included. Outcomes of interest were daily cumulative and daily incremental COVID-19 infection rates. Outcomes were log-transformed. Log-linear regression models with a quadratic time-trend and random intercepts for states were estimated. Covariates included log-transformed test-rates, a binary indicator for stay-at-home, percentage of African American, poverty, percentage elderly, state population and prevalence of selected comorbidities. Binary fixed effects for date each state first started reporting test data were included. Results: Stay-at-home orders were associated with decreases in cumulative ({beta}:-1.23; T-stat: -6.84) and daily ({beta}:-0.46; T-stat: -2.56) infection-rates. Predictive analyses indicated that expected cumulative infection rates would be 3 times higher and expected daily incremental rates about 60% higher in absence of stay-at-home orders. Higher African American population was associated with higher cumulative ({beta}: 0.08; T-stat: 4.01) and daily ({beta}: 0.06; T-stat: 3.50) rates. State poverty rates had mixed results and were not robust to model specifications. There was strong evidence of a quadratic daily trend for cumulative and daily rates. Results were largely robust to alternate specifications. Conclusions: We find evidence that stay-at-home orders, which were widely supported by public-health experts, helped to substantially curb COVID-19 infection-rates. As we move to a phased re-opening, continued precautions advised by public-health experts should be adhered to. Also, a larger African American population is strongly associated with incidence of COVID-19 infection. Policies and resources to help mitigate African American vulnerability to COVID-19 is an urgent public health and social justice issue, especially since the ongoing mass protests against police brutality may further exacerbate COVID-19 contagion in this community.","output":"Stay-at-Home Orders, African American Population, Poverty and State-level Covid-19 Infections: Are there associations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the benefit of population-level public facial masking to protect others during the COVID-19 pandemic has received a great deal of attention, we discuss for one of the first times the hypothesis that universal masking reduces the \\"inoculum\\" or dose of the virus for the mask-wearer, leading to more mild and asymptomatic infection manifestations. Masks, depending on type, filter out the majority of viral particles, but not all. We first discuss the near-century-old literature around the viral inoculum and severity of disease (conceptualized as the LD50 or lethal dose of the virus). We include examples of rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking, including in closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) with and without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may be harmful for spread but could actually be beneficial if they lead to higher rates of exposure. Exposing society to SARS-CoV-2 without the unacceptable consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine. This theory of viral inoculum and mild or asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 in light of population-level masking has received little attention so this is one of the first perspectives to discuss the evidence supporting this theory.","output":"Masks Do More Than Protect Others During COVID-19: Reducing the Inoculum of SARS-CoV-2 to Protect the Wearer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown and self-isolation are to date the only solution to limit the spread of recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (CoViD-19), highlighting the great advantage of home dialysis in a patient otherwise forced to travel from / to the dialysis center to receive this \\"life-saving\\" treatment.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents a type of home dialysis therapy not yet adequately implemented to date, in spite of safe and simple practice, as well as similar dialytic efficiency vs in-center hemodialysis.

The use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits.

Defects in T-cell function and trafficking have been described among those with severe illness, and immunodeficiency is a risk factor for persistent viral shedding and prolonged symptoms. Because of our prior clinical data demonstrating that allogeneic, off-the-shelf virus-specific T cells (VSTs) can safely and effectively treat viral infections, we investigated the feasibility of targeting COVID-19 using banked, SARS-CoV-2-specific VSTs. METHODS: We first screened PBMCs from convalescent individuals against 18 structural and non-structural/accessory (NSPs/APs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins and identified 5 [Spike (S), Membrane (M), Nucleoprotein (N), NSP4, and AP7a] as immunodominant which were then advanced to our VST production process. RESULTS: Using overlapping peptide libraries spanning these antigens as a stimulus, we achieved a mean 7.60.9 fold expansion (n=13) of VSTs (960.5%), with a mixture of cytotoxic (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) T cells that expressed activation and central/effector memory markers. These VSTs were potent, Th1-polarized and polyfunctional, producing IFN, TNF, GM-CSF and Granzyme B. Moreover, the VSTs were able to kill pepmix-loaded autologous targets with no evidence of auto- or alloreactivity, attesting to their virus selectivity and safety for clinical use (Figure 1). Finally, though initially generated against the reference strain NC_045512.2 (Wuhan), these VSTs were able to recognize other clinically important variants including B1.1.7 (UK), B1.351 (South Africa) and P1 (Brazil). This demonstrates the cross-reactive potential of these polyclonal and diverse VSTs, which were developed to provide potent antiviral effects and minimize the risk of immune escape due to sequence variation. Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 Specific T cells Have Demonstrated Selective Cytolytic Activity against SARS-CoV-2 While Leaving Non-Virus Infected Targets Intact.

We have advanced this product to the bedside for administration in a Phase I, randomized clinical trial [VSTs+ standard of care (SOC) vs SOC] in high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (NCT04401410).

The present article analyses if applicants' performances in the interviews were the determining criterion of student selection, despite a higher weighting of school grades in the admission process. Furthermore, this article checks whether the grading of the interviews was independent of the applicants' gender, age, origin and educational background. METHODS: For a sample of more than 3,000 successful and unsuccessful participants in the MHH student admission process in the years 2010-2017, we employ variance analysis and logistic regression analysis to determine those factors that have contributed to the chances of being offered a place at the MHH after a successful interview. RESULTS: The scores received in the selection interview were the sole determinant of being offered a place at the MHH; neither the applicants'age nor their gender or origin biased the decisions of the selection committees. The grading of the interview was also not affected by school GPAs. DISCUSSION: The selection interviews at the MHH have been costly in terms of both financial and human resources. However, this selection method has been popular among students and lecturers alike, not least because its elements fit the MHH's focus on early bedside teaching and social skills of prospective physicians. However, there is no evidence that selection interviews are effective in predicting academic success. CONCLUSIONS: The present article has shown that the selection interviews acted up to the principles defined by the MHH: very homogenous high school GPAs were complemented by differentiated interview assessments that did not discriminate by sociodemographic characteristics. It is, however, unclear if the MHH will resume the interviews after the end of a federally mandated halt to stand-alone selection methods at medical schools in Germany.","output":"[Selection interviews at Hanover Medical School (MHH): determinants of student selection in medical studies]./ Auswahlgespr?che an der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover: Determinanten der Studierendenauswahl im Studiengang Medizin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Surgical implantation of a prosthetic aortic valve is typically done with multiple interrupted sutures. We adapted a running suture line technique for prostheses implantation to decrease the rate of complete heart block necessitating permanent pacemaker. METHODS 374 patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacements were identified between 2015 and 2017. Patients with preoperative heart block, patients undergoing concomitant MAZE procedure and those undergoing multivalve procedures were excluded. Interrupted technique was performed with multiple non-pledgeted sutures. Running technique was performed with three 2-0 polypropylene sutures. Propensity-score matching (caliper distance = 0.10) was used to match based on patient age, gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, heart failure, arrythmias, use of anti-arrhythmics, and STS PROM. RESULTS Propensity score matching yielded 103 pairs of running technique and interrupted technique patients for analysis. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, there were no differences in sustained complete heart block and need for pacemaker, 4 (3.8%) for running technique vs 3 (2.9%) for interrupted technique (p = 0.307). At 4 weeks, there was no difference in mean prosthetic aortic valve gradients calculated on transthoracic echocardiogram (6.39  2.47 mmHg vs 6.46  2.86, p = 0.850). There was no difference in paravalvular leak (0 (0%) vs 2 (1.9%), p = 0.070).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A library of 120 phytochemical ligands was prepared, from which 5 were selected considering their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADMET) and quantitative structureCactivity relationship (QSAR) profiles. The protein active sites and belonging quantum tunnels were defined to conduct supramolecular docking of the aforementioned ligands. The hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic interactions between the ligandCreceptor complexes were studied following the molecular docking steps. A comprehensive molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) was conducted for each of the ligandCreceptor complexes to figure out the values C root mean square deviation (RMSD) (?), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) (?), H-bonds, C, solvent accessible surface area (SASA) (?(2)), molecular surface area (MolSA) (?(2)), Rg (nm), and polar surface area (PSA) (?). Finally, computational programming and algorithms were used to interpret the dynamic simulation outputs into their graphical quantitative forms. RESULTS: ADMET and QSAR profiles revealed that the most active candidates from the library to be used were apigenin, isovitexin, piperolactam A, and quercetin as test ligands, whereas serpentine as the control. Based on the binding affinities of supramolecular docking and the parameters of molecular dynamic simulation, the strength of the test ligands can be classified as isovitexin > quercetin > piperolactam A > apigenin when complexed with the hACE2 receptor. Surprisingly, serpentine showed lower affinity (?8.6 kcal/mol) than that of isovitexin (?9.9 kcal/mol) and quercetin (?8.9 kcal/mol). The MDS analysis revealed all ligands except isovitexin having a value lower than 2.5 ?. All the test ligands exhibited acceptable fluctuation ranges of RMSD (?), RMSF (?), H-bonds, C, SASA (?(2)), MolSA (?(2)), Rg (nm), and PSA (?) values. CONCLUSION: Considering each of the parameters of molecular optimization, docking, and dynamic simulation interventions, all of the test ligands can be suggested as potential targeted drugs in blocking the hACE2 receptor.","output":"Active site-specific quantum tunneling of hACE2 receptor to assess its complexing poses with selective bioactive compounds in co-suppressing SARS-CoV-2 influx and subsequent cardiac injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Northern Territory (NT) Centre for Disease Control (CDC) undertook contact tracing of all notified cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the Territory.

Many real-world networks like Road Network, Email Networks are weighted networks. Influence maximization on weighted networks is more challenging than an unweighted network. Many methods, such as weighted-degree rank, weighted-voteRank, weighted-eigenvalue rank, and weighted-betweenness rank methods, have been used to rank the nodes in weighted networks with certain limitations. In this manuscript, we propose a Hookes law-based approach named HookeRank method to identify spreaders in a weighted network. We model edge weights as spring constants. The edges present in the network are modeled as springs, which are connected in series and parallel. They elongate by a distance under the effect of a given constant force following Hookes law of elasticity, and this is the equivalent propagation distance between nodes in the network. The proposed the model finds relevant influential nodes, that can propagate the information to other nodes. A higher HookeRank score implies the greater influential capability of the node in the network.

The drastic lockdown responses to COVID-19 and the limitations on local and international travel highlighted the importance of the visual and the potential of the virtual. However, visual media can also be understood as systems that go far beyond a strict representation of an object. In this climate where publicity, politics, and perception play ever more crucial roles, representations of iconic architecture and landscapes increasingly blur the boundaries between the imaginary and the tangible. This paper examines the experience of iconic architecture and landscape in four iconic European cities (Paris, Barcelona, Seville, and Lisbon) as seen through the eyes of fifty postgraduate architecture, interior architecture, and landscape architecture students from New Zealand. It compares their understanding of a building or landscape from its photographic image before engaging with the physical reality. Students were asked to first identify iconic architecture and landscape, then closely analyze and document the essential qualities which established its pre-eminence. A subsequent visit to each of the places provided the opportunity for comparison and the testing of the realities and fictions of the icons themselves.

In other types of hernia repair, use of mesh is associated with reduced recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to compare the use of mesh versus sutures alone for the repair of hiatal hernia in laparoscopic antireflux surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GORD between January 2006 and December 2010 were allocated randomly to closure of the diaphragmatic hiatus with crural sutures or non-absorbable polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (CruraSoft?). The primary outcome was recurrence of hiatal hernia, as determined by barium swallow study 12 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were: intraoperative and postoperative complications, use of antireflux medication, postoperative oesophageal acid exposure, quality of life, dysphagia and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS Some 77 patients were randomized to the suture technique and 82 patients underwent mesh repair. At 1 year, the hiatal hernia had recurred in six of 64 patients (9 per cent) in the mesh group and two of 64 (3 per cent) in the suture group (P = 0144). Reflux symptoms, use of proton pump inhibitors and oesophageal acid exposure did not differ between the groups. At 3 years, recurrence rates were 13 and 10 per cent in the mesh and suture groups respectively (P = 0692). Dysphagia scores decreased in both groups, but more patients had dysphagia for solid food after mesh closure (P = 0013). Quality-of-life scores were comparable between the groups.

This makes ground-based experiments examining the effect of each space flight associated factor along of particular value. Determining mechanisms causing alterations in cosmonauts immunity can lead to potential targets for different countermeasures. In the current article we present the study of the early period of adaptation of human innate immunity of 6 healthy test-subjects, 4 males and 2 females aged 25 through 40, to isolation factors (hypodynamia, psychological stress, artificial environment). We measured multiple parameters characterizing innate immunity status in blood samples at chosen time points before, during and after the mission. In the experiment, highly enhanced cytokine responses were observed upon ex vivo antigen stimulations in comparison to baseline values. For cellular parameters we found multidirectional dynamics with a persistent prevalence of increasing TLRs(+) monocytes as well as TLRs expression. Our study provides evidence that even a short-term confinement leads to immune changes in healthy humans that may trigger aberrant immune response.","output":"The impact of short-term confinement on human innate immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable and older people with chronic and complex conditions have self-isolated in their homes, potentially limiting opportunities for consultations to have medications prescribed and dispensed.

DISCUSSION Cooperation between wholesalers and purchase limits in pharmacies have helped to ensure supply of essential medications. Therapeutic substitution by pharmacists is permitted for specific products authorised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Prescribers are permitted to issue digital image prescriptions, and implementation of electronic prescribing has been fast-tracked. Expanded continued dispensing arrangements introduced during the bushfire crises have been temporarily extended. Pharmacists are permitted to provide medication management reviews via telehealth. A Home Medicines Service has been introduced to facilitate delivery of medications to people who are vulnerable or elderly.

METHODS Feasibility study of twenty patients admitted to the intensive care unit following a cardiac arrest. All patients underwent continuous rSO2 monitoring using the INVOS(?) cerebral oximeter. ICM+(?) brain monitoring software calculates the cerebral oximetry index (COx) in real-time which is a moving Pearson correlation coefficient between 30 consecutive, 10-s averaged values of MAP and correspond rSO2 signals. When rSO2 increases with increasing MAP (COx 0.3), cerebral autoregulation is dysfunctional. Conversely, when rSO2 remains constant or decreases with increasing MAP (COx <0.3), autoregulation is preserved. ICM+(?) fits a U-shaped curve through the COx values plotted vs. MAP. The MAPOPT is nadir of this curve. RESULTS The median age was 59 years (IQR 54-67) and 7 of 20 were female. The cardiac arrest was caused by myocardial infarction in 12 (60%) patients. Nineteen arrests were witnessed and return of spontaneous circulation occurred in a median of 15.5min (IQR 8-33). Patients underwent a median of 30h (IQR 23-46) of monitoring. COx curves and MAPOPT were generated in all patients. The mean overall MAP and MAPOPT were 76mmHg (SD 10) and 76mmHg (SD 7), respectively. MAP was outside of 5mmHg from MAPOPT in 50% (SD 15) of the time. Out of the 7672 5-min averaged COx measurements, 1182 (15%) were at 0.3 or above, indicating absence of autoregulation. Multivariable polynomial fractional regression demonstrated an increase in COx with increasing temperature (P=0.008).

Aiming to improve the anatomical cure rate, we implemented double-layered anterior colporrhaphy (DAC). With a retrospective investigation, precise description and video of the surgical technique, we want to contribute to the development of native tissue anterior repair. METHODS: Women treated by DAC and vaginal hysterectomy were included. Primary outcome was anatomic cure defined as prolapse < stage 2. Secondary outcomes were complication rate, resolution of postvoid residual urine, reoperation for prolapse and patient satisfaction. Follow-up encompassed a clinical gynecologic examination, the German Pelvic Floor Questionnaire and a response scale for postoperative quality of life (QoL). The key difference between DAC and AC is the continuous suture followed by the traditional interrupted sutures. RESULTS: One hundred one patients were eligible, and 60 patients attended follow-up. Cure was achieved in 49 cases (81.7%) of cystocele with a median follow-up of 19.3 months. Fifty-five patients (91.7%) indicated an improvement in QoL. CONCLUSIONS: We observed high anatomic cure rate and satisfaction after DAC. With description and video of the technique, it is reproducible and comparable to other methods.

This work provides a systematic review of the clinical experience with anti-cytokine agents and agents targeting lymphocytes and aims to evaluate their efficacy and safety for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Moreover, the review analyzes the main therapeutic perspectives in this field. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted on MEDLINE database. Search terminology was constructed using the name of the specific drug (anakinra, canakinumab, tocilizumab, adalimumab, rituximab, and natalizumab) and the terms status epilepticus, epilepsy, and seizure. The review included clinical trials, prospective studies, case series, and reports published in English between January 2016 and August 2021. The number of patients and their age, study design, specific drugs used, dosage, route, and timing of administration, and patients outcomes were extracted. The data were synthesized through quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Our search identified 12 articles on anakinra and canakinumab, for a total of 37 patients with epilepsy (86% febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome), with reduced seizure frequency or seizure arrest in more than 50% of the patients. The search identified nine articles on the use of tocilizumab (16 patients, 75% refractory status epilepticus), with a high response rate. Only one reference on the use of adalimumab in 11 patients with Rasmussen encephalitis showed complete response in 45% of the cases. Eight articles on rituximab employment sowed a reduced seizure burden in 16/26 patients. Finally, one trial concerning natalizumab evidenced a response in 10/32 participants. CONCLUSION: The experience with anti-cytokine agents and drugs targeting lymphocytes in epilepsy derives mostly from case reports or series. The use of anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, and anti-CD20 agents in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and refractory status epilepticus has shown promising results and a good safety profile. The experience with TNF inhibitors is limited to Rasmussen encephalitis. The use of anti-4-integrin agents did not show significant effects in refractory focal seizures.

We previously reported decreased CypA levels in hepatocytes of transgenic mice expressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). In this study, we found that expression of HBV small surface protein (SHBs) in human hepatoma cell lines specifically triggered CypA secretion, whereas SHBs added extracellularly to culture medium did not. Moreover, CypA secretion was not promoted by the expression of a secretion deficient SHBs mutant, suggesting a close association between secretion of CypA and SHBs. Interaction between CypA and SHBs was observed by using coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Hydrodynamic injection of the SHBs expression construct into C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased serum CypA levels and ALT/AST levels, as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding SHBs-positive hepatocytes. The inflammatory response and serum ALT/AST level were reduced when the chemotactic effect of CypA was inhibited by cyclosporine and anti-CD147 antibody. Furthermore, higher serum CypA levels were detected in chronic hepatitis B patients than in healthy individuals. In HBV patients who had received liver transplantation, serum CypA levels declined dramatically after the loss of HBsAg as a consequence of liver transplantation. Taken together, these results indicate that expression and secretion of SHBs can promote CypA secretion, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infection.","output":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen interacts with and promotes cyclophilin a secretion: possible link to pathogenesis of HBV infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives : Based on the regional incidence data of COVID- 19 and the research of the current status of China's public health emergency management system, this article proposes some executable strategies for emergency management and provides some reflections for the modernization of China's governance system and capacity for governance Methods : (1) Real- time data of the epidemic situation could be obtained by Python from National Health Commission in order to plot graphs showing the spread, the incidence trend of the epidemic and the number of confirmed, cured and death cases in every province (2) A web page program named 'customized epidemic prevention map' was developed so that the precise protection of individuals would be available through mobile phone to locate the confirmed cases nearby immediately (3) Mobile Apps were developed to provide the public with some convenient medical services, such as oneclick login, unified booking appointment and on- line consultation (4) 'Mini programs' in WeChat were developed In some gathering spots, such as communities, food markets and so on, people's location could be tracked by scanning the QR code to better control of sudden onset (5) A scientific and accurate management service model which named 'health code' was applied to compare and verify the public and the relevant data on the prevention and control of the epidemic in the areas of public security, health, telecommunications and traffic with the information submitted by the citizens Results : (1) The overall trend of development and the regional distribution of the epidemic made public know the incidence near their residence to build confidence to overcome the epidemic (2) The customized epidemic prevention map allayed fears of the threat to people's own safety and eased the panic to some extent (3) Mobile Apps reduced the communication cost between doctors and patients and improved the efficiency and quality of medical care in order that seeing a doctor became convenient, normal and sustainable (4) 'Mini programs' in WeChat helped some residents and shoppers feel at ease about their surroundings (5) Everyone's awareness of safety protection was improved The QR code not only showed personal health but also made people around them feel reassured, it also urged others to check their health status each other, which could realize one- time declaration, city- wide application, dynamic management and classified control Conclusion : With the social development and economic progress, the public health has extended to the health management of the whole crowd and the full life cycle, but the prevention and control of acute infectious diseases should be placed at the core of public health The Integrated emergency management system of grid management can play an important role in alleviating epidemic situation to some extent Meanwhile, the big data technology will play an increasingly important role in the prevention and control of major outbreaks in the future","output":"Research on emergency management of Covid-19 and future major epidemic situation based on big data technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped health care delivery for all patients but has distinctly affected the most marginalized people in society.

SETTING: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. RESULTS: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization.

Five months prior he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and a pulmonary embolus requiring 2L/min of supplemental oxygen, enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. He was discharged home with apixaban and supplemental oxygen. He had a 10 pack-per-year history of smoking and quit fifty years ago. He had no occupational or environmental exposures associated with pulmonary fibrosis. He had no family history of connective tissue disease or pulmonary fibrosis. On physical examination, he had normal vital signs and his saturation was 100% on room air. Pertinent positive exam findings were limited to bibasilar dry crackles. There were no skin, joint, or oral findings. Pulmonary function tests showed normal lung volumes with normal spirometry and a severely decreased diffusing capacity. A CT revealed improvement of ground glass opacities with persistent subpleural reticulations and honeycombing. Notably, lung images of the lower lobes from a CT scan of the abdomen six years prior to this evaluation showed bibasilar reticulations and ground glass infiltrates. Laboratory studies were notable for an elevated ANA titer in a speckled pattern, elevated CCP and elevated anti-SSA 52 kD. Additional autoimmune serologies were negative. Given the presence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) in prior imaging and elevated autoimmune markers, he was deemed to have had an exacerbation of previously subclinical ILD caused by COVID-19. The long-term effects of the inflammatory response from COVID-19 have not been characterized. Initial data of CT scans in patients show that up to 17% develop fibrotic changes during the course of the disease. It remains to be seen whether there will be a progressive fibrotic phenotype solely attributable COVID-19 itself. This has been described during the H1N1 and SARS-COV1 outbreaks in patients who developed ARDS but is not observed in post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis caused by other etiologies. The key to differentiating between a primary ILD rather than post-COVID-19 hinges on antecedent history. The patient's prior radiographic findings meet the research construct of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) which refers to patterns of increased lung density in patients with no history of ILD. When post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is observed, due diligence must be taken to determine alternate etiologies of subclinical ILD that may have been unmasked by COVID-19, rather than caused by it. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 could activate a latent autoimmunity or potentially cause a de novo autoimmune lung disease as has been suggested.","output":"The chicken or the egg? newly diagnosed interstitial lung disease (ILD) after novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immediate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for preventing the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This review summarizes our current understanding of how the choice of the constituting lipids governs the structure of their CLCNA self-assemblies, which constitute distinct liquid crystalline phases, and the relation of these structures to their efficacy for delivery. In addition, we review progress toward CLCNA nanoparticles for targeted NA delivery in vivo and close with an outlook on CL-based carriers of hydrophobic drugs, which may eventually lead to combination therapies with NAs and drugs for cancer and other diseases.","output":"Cationic Liposomes as Vectors for Nucleic Acid and Hydrophobic Drug Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this short communication, we summarized the analyses, models, and interpretations of the corporate department of emergency medicine's (CDEM) COVID-19 numbers and their relationship to predict the national COVID-19 trends and numbers in Qatar.

The ecarin clotting assay (ECA), performed on the ClotPro viscoelastic testing device, may enable sensitive and specific detection of dabigatran. We assessed the association between trough plasma dabigatran concentration and clotting time (CT) in the ClotPro ECA, in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Each patient provided a single venous blood sample, 1 hour before dabigatran dosing. The study included 118 patients, of whom 64 were receiving dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and 54 were receiving 150 mg twice daily. ECA CT was moderately correlated with trough plasma dabigatran concentration (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). Slight trends toward increased plasma dabigatran concentration and prolonged ECA CT were apparent with 150 mg versus the 110 mg dose (differences not statistically significant). Individuals with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/minute had significantly higher plasma dabigatran concentrations and significantly prolonged ECA CT versus those with creatinine clearance 50 mL/minute. In conclusion, this preliminary study has demonstrated that CT in the ClotPro ECA reflects the plasma concentration of dabigatran in patients with NVAF.

Clinic-based treatment can be disruptive and costly to patients and caregivers, requiring transportation, time away from work/family responsibilities, and stressful clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased concerns that patients may be exposed-or experience anxiety about exposure-to viruses and other pathogens. Potential benefits to home-based chemotherapy include cost/healthcare resource utilization savings and decreased infection exposure by avoiding clinical settings. In the COVID-19 era, ASH, ASCO, ESMO, and other groups have recommended home administration of chemotherapy, including infusions at home and self-administered oral and subcutaneous treatments, for certain cancer types where feasible. This literature review evaluated patient- and caregiver-relevant advantages of home-administered cancer therapy. Methods: A strategic literature review was conducted using the pearl growing/snowball method, wherein core publications were identified using an initial PubMed search strategy with the MeSH heading Antineoplastic Agents/Administration & Dosage and the search terms Home Care Services and Patient Satisfaction. Results were limited to English-language publications dated January 2000 to July 2020, 10 study subjects, adult subjects only, with no limits for geography or cancer type. A total of 21 initial results were retrieved in PubMed. Six core publications were used to establish keywords and for bibliographic and prospective citation searches to identify additional relevant publications relating to patient preference and patient/caregiver-reported outcomes regarding cancer treatment administration settings. In addition to PubMed, the following congresses were searched: ASH (2004-2019), ASCO (2011-2020), EHA (2016-2019) and ESMO (2010-2019). Results: Thirty-one studies involving both hematologic cancers and solid tumors were identified from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Cancer therapy was administered by patients/caregivers (ie, oral or subcutaneous) or a visiting nurse. All the studies reviewed reported benefits for home- vs clinic-based treatment. Patient expressed preference/satisfaction and willingness to continue with home-based regimens; while methodologies varied among studies, 70% to 100% of patients preferred home administration. Across studies, over half of patients receiving home treatment cited improvement in outcomes including well-being, activities of daily living, and family/social life, with benefits including convenience, comfort, reduced travel/financial burden, limited waiting time, and greater ability to maintain daily family/social activities. The impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL) could not be compared quantitatively among studies as <25% of the studies used validated tools, e.g., EORTC-QOL-C30. Among studies using validated tools, HRQoL outcomes were generally similar for patients treated at home or in-clinic. There were very few reports of patients needing or choosing to return to clinic-based care after initiating home treatment. Studies that captured safety outcomes did not report increased adverse effects or emergency room visits among patients treated at home. Of the 3 studies reporting caregiver outcomes, most caregivers expressed satisfaction with and preference for home treatment. Conclusions: The prioritization of therapies that can be administered at home has been proposed as a strategy for infection control in the COVID-19 era, but it is not currently a standard approach in the US. This targeted literature review consistently found patient-relevant benefits with home-administered chemotherapy. The identified studies provided minimal information on caregiver-reported outcomes, which is a limitation given that home-based cancer treatment impacts caregivers as well as patients. Home-based treatment may enhance quality of survival time and reduce healthcare resource utilization while maintaining clinical benefits of treatment and reducing contact with people in a busy clinical setting. While treatment decisions should consider patient preference for home-based treatment, some patients' treatment pathways will require care at an outpatient or inpatient facility.

These properties could be improved by chemical and/or physical modification, including grafting and/or crosslinking techniques. In this work, acrylonitrile (ACN) has been successfully grafted onto ENR- 25 by a radical photopolymerization technique. The effect of (ACN to ENR) mole ratios on chemical structure and interaction, thermo-mechanical behaviour and that related to the viscoelastic properties of the polymer was investigated. The existence of the CCN functional group at the end-product of ACN-g-ENR is confirmed by infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. An enhanced grafting efficiency (~57%) was obtained after ACN was grafted onto the isoprene unit of ENR- 25 and showing a significant improvement in thermal stability and dielectric properties. The viscoelastic behaviour of the sample analysis showed an increase of storage modulus up to 150  10(3) MPa and the temperature of glass transition (T(g)) was between ?40 and 10 C. The loss modulus, relaxation process, and tan delta were also described. Overall, the ACN-g-ENR shows a distinctive improvement in characteristics compared to ENR and can be widely used in many applications where natural rubber is used but improved thermal and mechanical properties are required.

The synthesis aimed to group similarities in consumer beliefs and perceptions of food safety. After screening, 74 eligible articles were included in the study. Of the 74 studies analyzed, 49 (66.2%) were carried out in China, 14 (18.9%) in Brazil, 5 (6.8%) in India,4 (5.4%) in South Africa, and 2 (2.7%) in Russia. Thirty-three motivators of perceptions and beliefs regarding food safety were identified. Food safety motivators were grouped into three categories: (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) cognitive aspects, and (3) other. In the sociodemographic characteristics category, the motivator with the highest number of corresponding results was education level (results = 22), followed by income (results = 22), both positive drivers for food safety perceptions. The cognitive aspects category comprised the majority of the identified motivators. Concern for food safety (results = 32) and risk perception (results = 30) were the motivators with the highest number of results among all categories and motivators. Finally, the main motivator in the other category was place of consumption/purchase (results = 8), focusing on consumers underestimating the risk of having a foodborne disease when eating away from home. China and Brazil are leading the way in studies on this topic. Consumers perceptions are influenced by socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education level, income), cognitive aspects (e.g., knowledge, risk perception, food concerns, previous experience with food safety incidents) and other situational factors (e.g., price, place of purchase, traceability).","output":"What Motivates Consumer Food Safety Perceptions and Beliefs?

However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenesis and therapy remains limited, emphasizing the urgent need for fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of macroautophagy/autophagy and hijacking of the autophagic machinery are essential for the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation and the function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3a as an inducer of autophagy (in particular reticulophagy) and revealed that ORF3a localizes to the ER and induces RETREG1/FAM134B-related reticulophagy through the HMGB1-BECN1 (beclin 1) pathway. As a consequence, ORF3a induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through reticulophagy and then sensitizes cells to the acquisition of an ER stress-related early apoptotic phenotype and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a hijacks reticulophagy and then disrupts ER homeostasis to induce ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings reveal the sequential induction of reticulophagy, ER stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and imply the therapeutic potential of reticulophagy and ER stress-related drugs for COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces RETREG1/FAM134B-dependent reticulophagy and triggers sequential ER stress and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has dramatically improved but increases the risk of bacterial and opportunistic infections.

Transcriptome analyses were performed using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus, GeneCards, and Human Protein Atlas databases. The significantly mitigated biological functions associated with anti-TNF therapy resistance in CD patients encompassed immune pathways, including Interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and rheumatoid arthritis. The scores of immune cell markers, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages/monocytes were also significantly decreased in non-responders compared with that measured in anti-TNF therapy responders. The KAT2B gene, associated with IL-17 cytokine mediated neutrophil mobilization and activation, was significantly under-expressed in both tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in anti-TNF therapy-resistant CD patients. The reduced expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines due to down-regulated IL-17 signaling, is suggestive of the primary non-response to anti-TNF agents in CD patients.

To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified.

Predictors of the initial drop and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown. To assess this, we performed a post-hoc analysis of 4289 participants in the CREDENCE trial with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease equally split into treatment and placebo groups who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week three. The eGFR was categorized at week three as greater than a 10% decline; between 0 and 10% decline; and no decline. Long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes were estimated in each category of acute eGFR change by linear mixed effects models and Cox regression after adjustment for baseline characteristics and medications use. Significantly more participants in the canagliflozin (45%) compared to the placebo (21%) group experienced an acute drop in eGFR over 10%. An over 30% drop occurred infrequently (4% of participants with canagliflozin and 2% with placebo). The odds ratio for a drop in eGFR over 10% with canagliflozin compared to placebo was significant at 3.03 (95% confidence interval 2.65, 3.47). Following the initial drop in eGFR, multivariable adjusted long-term eGFR trajectories, as well as overall and kidney safety profiles, in those treated with canagliflozin were similar across eGFR decline categories. Thus, although acute drops in eGFR over 10% occurred in nearly half of all participants following initiation of canagliflozin, the clinical benefit of canagliflozin was observed regardless. Additionally, safety outcomes were similar among subgroups of acute eGFR drop.","output":"Insights from CREDENCE trial indicate an acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with canagliflozin with implications for clinical practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of April 24, 2020, more than 1. 6 billion Muslims observe the holy fasting month of Ramadan worldwide.

Society and healthcare think nursing is a doctor helper service. The public image of a nurse as a doctor's helper is hard to erase. Thus, the nursing development in Indonesia needs to be explored in describing the stereotyping and the nursing conditions in the current situation. METHODS: The study used a narrative review with 45 sources analyzed and extracted. RESULTS: Nursing education has been developed since colonialism. The first time the Netherland Indies built the hospital and they used Babu or a helper as a nurse. The result showed it had a negative impact, which showed as they started to train nurses. They trained male nurses to be Mantri nurses as hulpgeneesheeren (ancillary doctors). After independence, the project HOPE influenced the development of nursing in Indonesia. Indonesian nurses focused on technical aspects and added the nursing process to the education curricula in 1986. However, nurses practice culture did not change for a long time because of a lack of research and literature being evaluated during 1990C2010. Indonesia nursing started to increase the education, practice, and research afterward, with specifically the declaration of the Indonesian Nursing Act. It brought nurses into the professionalism of healthcare which the Indonesian government recognized. Then, nurses have faced new problems, including practice and education gaps. CONCLUSION: The development of nurses will increase autonomy and dignity. Increasing education curricula, practice competency, and research impact will change the perspective of society with the support of recognition and education from the nursing organization. In addition, the nursing organization has an essential role in nursing development in each country.","output":"Nursing Development in Indonesia: Colonialism, After Independence and Nursing act"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) probe insertion in anaesthetised patients can cause pharyngeal and oesophageal injuries. Kim et al. have shown that insertion assisted by a Macintosh laryngoscope can reduce such complications but it may sometimes be difficult to observe the passage of a TOE probe. The McGRATH MAC (McGRATH) has been shown to provide a better view of the glottis, piriform fossa and oesophageal inlet during tracheal intubation than the Macintosh. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that the McGRATH provided better visualisation of the oesophageal inlet and was useful as an aid to TOE probe placement, possibly reducing the incidence of pharyngeal injury related to insertion, compared with the Macintosh. DESIGN A randomised controlled trial. SETTING The study was conducted in a university hospital from February to December 2014. PATIENTS One hundred patients undergoing elective surgery under intraoperative TOE monitoring were randomised to either a Macintosh group or a McGRATH group. INTERVENTIONS Macintosh and McGRATH were used to visualise the passage of the TOE probe and guide its insertion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Visibility of the oesophageal inlet, the number of TOE insertion attempts and incidence of pharyngeal mucosal injury after the TOE probe had been removed were assessed. RESULTS The percentage of patients in whom the oesophageal inlet was visible was higher in the McGRATH group (88%) than in the Macintosh group (41%) (P < 0.01). The number of TOE probe insertion attempts was significantly smaller in the McGRATH group than in the Macintosh group (P = 0.039). The incidence of pharyngeal mucosal injury was significantly smaller in the McGRATH group (4%) than in the Macintosh group (16%; P = 0.042).

Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust provides 1412 inpatient beds staffed by 1200 junior doctors and faced a large burden of COVID-19 admissions. LOCAL PROBLEM: A survey of doctors revealed only 20% felt confident that they would know to whom they could raise concerns and that most were getting information from a combination of informal work discussions, trust emails, social media and medical literature. METHODS: This quality improvement project was undertaken aligning with Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines. Through an iterative process, a digital network (Imperial Covid cOmmunications Network; ICON) using existing smartphone technologies was developed. Concerns were collated from the junior body and conveyed to the leadership team (vertical-bottom-up using Google Form) and responses were conveyed from leadership to the junior body (vertical-top-down using WhatsApp and Zoom). Quantitative analysis on engagement with the network (members of the group and number of issues raised) and qualitative assessment (thematic analysis on issues) were undertaken. RESULTS: Membership of the ICON WhatsApp group peaked at 780 on 17 May 2020. 197 concerns were recorded via the Google Form system between 20 March and 14 June 2020. There were five overarching themes: organisational and logistics; clinical strategy concerns; staff safety and well-being; clinical (COVID-19) and patient care; and facilities. 94.4% of members agreed ICON was helpful in receiving updates and 88.9% agreed ICON improved collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that a coordinated network using existing smartphone technologies and a novel communications structure can improve collaboration between senior leadership and junior doctors.

Evidence on the safe extension of international normalized ratio (INR) testing frequency remains an area of interest, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to safely extend INR testing intervals in patients throughout a multisite, system-wide anticoagulation clinic. Updates were made to the pharmacists collaborative practice agreement (CPA) and nurse protocol to optimize practice and allow INR testing interval extension up to a maximum of 8-weeks. The primary outcome was the change in duration between INR tests (INR testing interval) measured before and after providing staff education on clinic updates. The mean duration between INR tests (SD) was 23.69 days (11.29) in the pre-intervention period and 25.58 days (13.91) in the post-intervention period. During the COVID-19 pandemic (post2), intervals were extended further to 27.81 days (14.96), demonstrating a statistically significant increase in INR testing interval from pre-intervention to post-intervention and to post2 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).

However, Eilat virus (EILV) is defective for infecting vertebrate cells at multiple levels of the viral life cycle. This host-restriction property renders EILV an attractive expression platform since it is not infectious for vertebrates and therefore provides a highly advantageous safety profile. Here, we investigated the feasibility of versatile EILV-based expression vectors. By replacing the structural genes of EILV with those of other alphaviruses, we generated seven different chimeras. These chimeras were readily rescued in the original mosquito cells and were able to reach high titers, suggesting that EILV is capable of packaging the structural proteins of different lineages. We also explored the ability of EILV to express authentic antigens via double subgenomic (SG) RNA vectors. Four foreign genetic materials of varied length were introduced into the EILV genome, and the expressed heterologous genetic materials were readily detected in the infected cells. By inserting an additional SG promoter into the chimera genome containing the structural genes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we developed a bivalent vaccine candidate against CHIKV and Zika virus. These data demonstrate the outstanding compatibility of the EILV genome.

Such studies can elucidate essential transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies. Methods: We analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19. Findings: Up to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of []8 secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed []4 days after symptom onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age. Conclusion: We found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised, retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented. Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Over time, the senior author (P.G.C.) has developed modifications in his technique for oncologic midface reconstruction to minimize complications and maximize outcomes. METHODS Over a 15-year period (1992 to 2006), 100 flaps for midface oncologic reconstruction were performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The first 50 flaps were performed from 1992 to 2000, and the second 50 flaps were performed from 2001 to 2006. Over time, technical improvements were made in the following areas: palate, dental implants and prosthesis, orbital floor, eyelid, nasal sidewall, lips, cranial base and dura, and pedicle anastomosis. Using a prospectively maintained database, the authors compared the functional and aesthetic outcomes of the first 50 flaps and the second 50 flaps. RESULTS Improvements in palatal reconstruction increased the proportion of patients who achieved normal speech from 38.9 percent in the first half of the series (1992 to 2000) to 50 percent in the second half of the series (2001 to 2006). The percentage of patients who were able to tolerate an unrestricted diet increased from 44.4 to 52 percent.

However, cognitive impairment may compromise motor control including walking automaticity. The objective of this study was to investigate PFC neural activity, evaluated using changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb), during preferred paced walking (PPW) in COPD patients and age-matched controls. The O(2)Hb from the left and right dorsolateral PFC was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Fifteen COPD patients (age: 71  8) and twenty age-matched controls (69  7 years) participated. Two-way mixed ANOVA demonstrated that O(2)Hb in both groups decreased during PPW from the start (quintile 1; Q1) to the end (quintile 5; Q5) in the left dorsolateral and medial PFC. Q1 was comprised of the data during the first 20% of the task, while Q5 included data collected in the last 20% of the task duration. PPW duration ranged between 30.0 and 61.4 s in the control group and between 28.6 and 73.0 s in COPD patients. COPD patients demonstrated a higher O(2)Hb in Q5 compared to the negative O(2)Hb in controls in the right medial and dorsolateral PFC during PPW. PPW velocity was lower in COPD patients compared to controls (1.02  0.22 vs. 1.22  0.14 m/s, p = 0.005). Healthy older controls exhibited automaticity during walking unlike patients with COPD.

Like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough, and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects epithelial cells expressing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology, and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with an in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence. The review also touches upon our current understanding of placental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, an important aspect of vertical transmission.

Surgeons in Erlangen, Germany, routinely perform complete mesocolic excision (CME) with central vascular ligation (CVL) and report 5-year survivals of higher than 89%. We aimed to further investigate the importance of CME and CVL surgery for colonic cancer by comparison with a series of standard specimens. METHODS The fresh photographs of 49 CME and CVL specimens from Erlangen and 40 standard specimens from Leeds, United Kingdom, for primary colonic adenocarcinoma were collected. Precise tissue morphometry and grading of the plane of surgery were performed before comparison to histopathologic variables. RESULTS CME and CVL surgery removed more tissue compared with standard surgery in terms of the distance between the tumor and the high vascular tie (median, 131 v 90 mm; P < .0001), the length of large bowel (median, 314 v 206 mm; P < .0001), and ileum removed (median, 83 v 63 mm; P = .003), and the area of mesentery (19,657 v 11,829 mm(2); P < .0001). In addition, CME and CVL surgery was associated with more mesocolic plane resections (92% v 40%; P < .0001) and a greater lymph node yield (median, 30 v 18; P < .0001). CONCLUSION Surgeons in Erlangen routinely practicing CME and CVL surgery remove more mesocolon and are more likely to resect in the mesocolic plane when compared with standard excisions. This, along with the associated greater lymph node yield, may partially explain the high 5-year survival rates reported in Erlangen.","output":"Complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation produces an oncologically superior specimen compared with standard surgery for carcinoma of the colon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly since December 2019, resulting in a pandemic that has, as of May 24, 2020, yielded over 5.3 million confirmed cases and over 340,000 deaths.1 As businesses move to safely reopen and frontline healthcare workers (HCW) continue to face this crisis, it is essential that health officials know who in the population is at the greatest risk of mortality if hospitalized and, therefore, has the greatest need to protect themselves from being infected. We examined the factors that increase the risk of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the four Trinity Health of New England hospitals (THONE) in Connecticut and Massachusetts who either died or were discharged between March 1CApril 22, 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of care were extracted from the electronic health record. A model of in-hospital mortality was made using a generalized linear model with binomial distribution and log link. RESULTS: The analysis included 346 patients: 229 discharged and 117 deceased. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality was increased for patients who were aged 60 or older (relative risk [RR] = 2.873; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.733C4.764; p = <0.001), had diabetes (RR = 1.432; 95% CI,1.068C1.921; p = 0.016), or had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR = 1.410; 95% CI, 1.058C1.878; p = 0.019). Hyperlipidemia had a protective effect, reducing the likelihood of mortality (RR = 0.745; 95% CI, 0.568C0.975; p = 0.032). Sensitivity and specificity of the model were 51.4% and 88.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Being age 60 or older or having a history of diabetes or COPD are the most useful risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As states ease stay-at-home orders, risk factors of severe disease can be used to identify those more likely to have worse outcomes if infected and hospitalized and, therefore, who in particular should continue to follow public health guidelines for avoiding infection: stay home if possible; practice physical distancing; and wear a facemask.","output":"Identifying Patients at Greatest Risk of Mortality due to COVID-19: A New England Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted cancer care globally. There are limited data of its impact in Africa. This study aims to characterize COVID-19 response strategies and impact of COVID-19 on cancer care and explore misconceptions in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of oncology providers in Africa between June and August 2020. Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis by income groups were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two participants initiated the survey, of which 79 respondents from 18 African countries contributed data. Ninety-four percent (66 of 70) reported country mitigation and suppression strategies, similar across income groups. Unique strategies included courier service and drones for delivery of cancer medications (9 of 70 and 6 of 70, respectively). Most cancer centers remained open, but > 75% providers reported a decrease in patient volume. Not previously reported is the fear of infectivity leading to staff shortages and decrease in patient volumes. Approximately one third reported modifications of all cancer treatment modalities, resulting in treatment delays. A majority of participants reported &#8804; 25 confirmed cases (44 of 68, 64%) and &#8804; 5 deaths because of COVID-19 (26 of 45, 58%) among patients with cancer. Common misconceptions were that Africans were less susceptible to the virus (53 of 70, 75.7%) and decreased transmission of the virus in the African heat (44 of 70, 62.9%). CONCLUSION: Few COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported among patients with cancer. However, disruptions and delays in cancer care because of the pandemic were noted. The pandemic has inspired tailored innovative solutions in clinical care delivery for patients with cancer, which may serve as a blueprint for expanding care and preparing for future pandemics. Ongoing public education should address COVID-19 misconceptions.

AIMS: To find whether an initial HRCT chest can help triage patient by determining their oxygen requirement, place of treatment, laboratory parameters and risk of mortality and to compare 3 CT scoring systems (0-20, 0-25 and percentage of involved lung models) to find if one is a better predictor of prognosis than the other. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a Tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, Patients undergoing CT scan were included by complete enumeration method. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Data collected included demographics, days from swab positivity to CT scan, comorbidities, place of treatment, laboratory parameters, oxygen requirement and mortality. We divided the patients into mild, moderate and severe based on 3 criteria - 20 point CT score (OS1), 25 point CT score (OS2) and opacity percentage (OP). CT scans were analysed using CT pneumonia analysis prototype software (Siemens Healthcare version 2.5.2, Erlangen, Germany). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ROC curve and Youden's index were used to determine cut off points. Multinomial logistic regression used to study the relations with oxygen requirement and place of admission. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was done to test the goodness of fit of our models. RESULTS: A total of 740 patients were included in our study. All the 3 scoring systems showed a significant positive correlation with oxygen requirement, place of admission and death. Based on ROC analysis a score of 4 for OS1, 9 for OS2 and 12.7% for OP was determined as the cut off for oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: CT severity scoring using an automated deep learning software programme is a boon for determining oxygen requirement and triage.

It is presented mainly by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest tightness. However, COVID-19 causes different upper respiratory tract-related symptoms including nasal congestion, sore throat, and olfactory dysfunction. Objective To discuss different ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations in COVID-19-positive patients and their relation to other manifestations and to the severity of COVID-19. Methods We detected ENT manifestations in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients at Zagazig Isolation Hospitals (Zagazig University hospitals, Zagazig Chest hospital, Al-Ahrar hospital, and Zagazig Fever hospital) with proportional allocation in the period from April 15 to June 15, 2020. All patients were subjected to full history taking and COVID-19 was categorized into 4 classes of severity after all patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Afterwards, the collected data was analyzed and compared. Results Among the included 120 COVID-19 patients, the most frequent reported ENT manifestations were; sore throat (30%), nasal congestion (28.3%), nasal obstruction (26.7%), sneezing (26.6%), headache (25%), smell and taste dysfunction (25%), rhinorrhea (20%), upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (15%), and tonsil enlargement (10%). The most common non-ENT manifestations were fever (88.3%), cough (63.3%), and dyspnea (45%). Conclusion Fever and cough are the dominant symptoms of COVID-19, but ENT manifestations for COVID-19 are common and should be a part of the suspected clinical criteria for COVID-19, particularly if the nasal examination was nonsignificant. The most common symptoms are sore throat, followed by nasal congestion and obstruction, headache, and lastly, olfactory dysfunction.","output":"Analysis of Ear, Nose and Throat Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Psychometric validity/reliability of 10-item and 2-item abbreviations of the ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10; CD-RISC-2) was investigated via item response theory and classic approaches. METHODS: We sampled 5023 adult American participants in a June/July 2020 survey on the COVID-19 pandemics psychological effects. Our questionnaire incorporated the CD-RISC-10 with other validated measures. CD-RISC-10 items were ranked on item-to-scale correlations, loadings on a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis model, and item slope/threshold parameters plus information curves from a unidimensional graded response model. Concurrent validity of the highest ranked item pair was evaluated vis--vis the CD-RISC-10 and CD-RISC?2. Internal consistency, based on average variance extracted (AVE) and multiple reliability coefficients, was also compared. Convergent/divergent validity was tested by correlating anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, anxiety sensitivity, coping, and personality measures with both scales and the highest ranked item pair. Binary agreement/classification indexes assessed inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: Items 2 and 9 from CD-RISC-10 ranked the highest. Reliability coefficients were > 0.93, > 0.72, and > 0.82 for the CD-RISC-10, CD-RISC-2, vs summation of items 2 and 9. AVEs were 0.66, 0.67, and 0.77. CD-RISC abbreviations and the summation of items 2 and 9 correlated negatively with anxiety (> ? 0.43), depression (> ? 0.42), and fear of COVID-19 (> ? 0.34); positively with emotional stability (> 0.53) and conscientiousness (> 0.40).

We aimed to determine the characteristics and outcomes of the patients who would have been denied admission to the ICU according to these protocols, including the cumulative number of saved ICU days. METHODS: We retrospectively identified the ethical triage status in every patient who was admitted to our 31-bed mixed ICU in Antwerp, Belgium during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the reason for admission. This study was possible since the capacity of our ICU had not been threatened, still enabling our usual case-per-case decision. We evaluated three different ETTs that were designed in our and two other hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the 81-day study period, 182 patients were admitted to the ICU. Of the patients, 9C23% would have been denied ICU admission according to the three assessed ETTs (WBD cohort), responsible for 8C18% (n = 116C257) of the total number of ICU days. Of the WBD patients, 44C55% eventually survived their hospital stay, compared to 71C74% of the patients that would have been allowed admission. Of the WBD patients admitted for respiratory failure due to COVID-19, 18C25% survived, a number that decreased to 0C20% when these patients required mechanical ventilation.

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.","output":"Small Molecules to Destabilize the ACE2-RBD Complex: A Molecular Dynamics Study for Potential COVID-19 Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide commitment to disseminate Psychological First Aid (PFA) training to enable frontline workers to support distressed individuals and/or manage their own self-care is increasing, but the evidence base of PFA training is uncertain.

For the treatment of COVID-19, selective lung-localizing strategies hold tremendous potential, as SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung via ACE2 receptors and causes severe pneumonia. Similarly, recent reports have shown the association of COVID-19 with decreased 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and increased cytokine levels. This mechanism, which involves the activation of inflammatory NF-&#954;B- and SREBP2-mediated inflammasome signaling pathways, is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.

However, little is known about the phenotype and function of these CD169+ monocytes. Here, we have investigated the phenotype of human CD169+ monocytes in different diseases, their capacity to activate CD8+ T cells, and the potential for a targeted-vaccination approach.

CD169+ monocytes expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory and HLA molecules, suggesting an increased activation state.

During this crisis, specialists from the laboratories and frontline clinical personnel have made great efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 by revealing the molecular biological characteristics and epidemic characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has severe consequences for public health, including human respiratory system, immune system, blood circulation system, nervous system, motor system, urinary system, reproductive system and digestive system. In the review, we summarize the physiological and pathological damage of SARS-CoV-2 to these systems and its molecular mechanisms followed by clinical manifestation. Concurrently, the prevention and treatment strategies of COVID-19 will be discussed in preclinical and clinical studies.

The vision targets to raise non-oil export from 16% to 50% of non-oil GDP by 2030. Achieving this, in addition to other goals, necessitates a better understanding of the non-oil export relationship with its determinants. However, we are not aware of a study that estimates the impacts of the determinants on Saudi non-oil exports covering the recent years of reforms and low oil prices and that conducts simulations for future. The purpose of this study is to develop an econometric modeling framework for Saudi non-oil export that can enhance informing the policymaking process through empirical estimations and simulations. For estimations, we applied cointegration and equilibrium correction methodology to the annual data for the period 1983C2018. Results show that Middle Eastern and North African countriesGDP, as a measure of foreign income, and Saudi Arabias non-oil GDP, as a measure of production capacity, have statistically significant positive effects on Saudi non-oil exports in the long run. The real effective exchange rate (REER), as a measure of competitiveness, also exerts a positive effect in the long run if it depreciates and vice versa. Furthermore, our findings support the Export-led growth concept, which articulates that export can be an engine of economic growth and does not support the Dutch disease concept, which highlights the consequences of the resource sector for the non-resource tradable sector for Saudi Arabia. Macroeconometric model-based simulations conducted up to 2030 reveal out that the Saudi non-oil export is more responsive to the changes in REER than any other determinants. The simulation results also show that non-oil manufacturing makes a three times larger contribution to the future expansion of non-oil exports than agriculture. Moreover, the simulations discover that finance, insurance, and other business services, as well as transport and communication play an important role in improving the Saudi non-oil export performance in the coming decade. The key policy recommendation is that measures should be implemented in a coordinated and balanced way to achieve non-oil exports and other targets of the Vision.","output":"Saudi Non-Oil Exports before and after COVID-19: Historical Impacts of Determinants and Scenario Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first local spread of COVID-19 in Israel was detected in March 2020. Due to the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin).The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher risk to be seropositive. The prevalence-to-incidence ratio was 4.5-15.7. Serology testing is an important complimentary tool for assessing the actual magnitude of infection and thus essential for implementing policy measures to control the pandemic.

If oximetry is not available, then the decision to provide oxygen must be based on other factors. METHODS: The variables associated with the decision to provide supplemental oxygen made by an emergency department staff, without access to oximetry, in a low resource Ugandan hospital were determined from data collected within 16 h of admission to the hospitals medical and surgical wards. RESULTS: Of 2,599 patients, 731 (28.1%) had an oxygen saturation <95%, and 164 (6.3%) an oxygen saturation <90%. Of the 731 patients with oxygen levels below 95% 573 (83%) were not given oxygen; oxygen was only given to 63 (38%) of the 164 patients with oxygen saturation <90%. On average, a patient given oxygen was more likely to die than one not given oxygen, regardless of their oxygen saturation (odds ratio 13.4, 95%CI 9.1C19.6). After multivariate analysis weakness, dyspnoea, low oxygen saturation, high heart rate, high respiratory rate, low temperature, alertness, gait, and a medical illness were all significantly associated with the use of supplemental oxygen and in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression modelling of these variables had comparable discrimination for both oxygen use (c statistic 0.88 SE 0.02) and in-hospital mortality (c statistic 0.84 SE 0.02).

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being immune to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes.

A 33.34 Mb genome sequence was assembled to 26 contigs, which lead to the prediction of 8278 protein-coding genes. From these genes, the potential biosynthesis pathway of sesquiterpenoids was, for the first time, identified from Sanghuangporus, besides that of triterpenoids. While polysaccharides are the main medicinal metabolites in S. sanghuang, flavonoids are especially abundant medicinal metabolites comparing with other medicinal macrofungal groups. From the genomic perspective, S. sanghuang has a tetrapolar heterothallic mating system, and has its special nutritional strategy and advantageous medicinal properties compared with S. baumii and S. vaninii.

However, limited information is available on the effect of biological wastewater treatment processes on the formation of CX3R-type DBPs. This study investigated the effect of oxidation ditch (OD) and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO), two widely used biological wastewater treatment processes, on the formation of five classes of CX3R-type DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs), during chlorination. Experimental results showed that biological treatment effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254, while it increased the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and therefore the ratio of DON/DOC. In addition, increases in the contents of soluble microbial product- and humic acid-like matters, and the transformation of high molecular weight (MW) fractions in the dissolved organic matter into low MW fractions were observed after OD and AAO processes. Although biological treatment effectively decreased the formation of Cl-THMs, Cl-HAAs, Cl-HANs and Cl-HNMs, the formation of DBCM, DBAA, BDCAA, DBCAA, DCAL, TCAL and DBAN (where C = chloro, B = bromo, D = di, T = tri) all increased significantly, due to the increased formation reactivity. Moreover, biological treatment increased the ratio of bromide/DOC and bromine incorporation into THMs, HAAs and DHANs except for HALs and THANs. Different from previous studies, this study revealed that biological treatment increased the formation of some DBPs, especially brominated DBPs, despite the efficient removal of organic matters.

The PBPK model in rat featured plasma and RBC concentrations, extensive and apparent nonlinear tissue distribution, fitted hepatic and renal intrinsic clearances, and a plasma half-life of about 1 day. Tissue to plasma CQ ratios at 50 h after dosing were highest in lung, kidney, liver, and spleen (182-318) and lower in heart, muscle, brain, eye, and skin (11-66). The RBC to plasma ratio of 11.6 was assumed to reflect cell lipid partitioning. A lysosome-based extended model was used to calculate subcellular CQ concentrations based on tissue mass balances, fitted plasma, interstitial, and free cytosol concentrations, and literature-based pH and pKa values. The CQ tissue component concentrations ranked: lysosome >> acidic phospholipid > plasma = interstitial = cytosol {greater than or equal to} neutral lipids. The extensive lysosome sequestration appeared to change over time and was attributed to lowering pH values caused by proton pump influx of hydrogen ions. The man-to-rat volume of distribution (Vss) ratio of 7 used to scale rat tissue partitioning to man along with estimation of hepatic clearance allowed excellent fitting of oral dose PK (150-600 mg) of CQ with a 50-day half-life in man. The prolonged PK of chloroquine was well-characterized for rat and man with this PBPK model. The calculated intra-tissue concentrations and lysosomal effects have therapeutic relevance for CQ and other cationic drugs. Significance Statement Sequestration in lysosomes is a major factor controlling the pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of chloroquine and other cationic drugs.

This enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits: targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.","output":"Unlinking super-linkers: the topology of epidemic response (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been applied extensively for elucidating many crucial biological mechanisms at the molecular level, this technique still faces critical challenges, the major one of which is to prepare the high-quality cryo-EM specimen. Aiming to achieve a more reproducible and efficient cryo-EM specimen preparation, novel supporting films including graphene-based two-dimensional materials have been explored in recent years. Here we report a robust and simple method to fabricate EM grids coated with single- or few-layer reduced graphene oxide (RGO) membrane in large batch for high-resolution cryo-EM structural determination. The RGO membrane has decreased interlayer space and enhanced electrical conductivity in comparison to regular graphene oxide (GO) membrane. Moreover, we found that the RGO supporting film exhibited nice particle-absorption ability, thus avoiding the air-water interface problem. More importantly, we found that the RGO supporting film is particularly useful in cryo-EM reconstruction of sub-100 kDa biomolecules at near-atomic resolution, as exemplified by the study of RBD-ACE2 complex and other small protein molecules. We envision that the RGO membranes can be used as a robust graphene-based supporting film in cryo-EM specimen preparation.","output":"Reduced graphene oxide membrane as supporting film for high-resolution cryo-EM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Interventional Management of Stroke III did not show that combining IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) with endovascular therapies (EVTs) is better than IV rt-PA alone. OBJECTIVE To report efficacy and safety results for EVT of intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery trunk (M1) occlusion. METHODS Five revascularization methods for persistent occlusions after IV rt-PA treatment were evaluated for prespecified primary and secondary endpoints, after accounting for differences in key baselines variables using propensity scores. Revascularization was scored using the arterial occlusive lesion (AOL) and the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) scores. RESULTS EVT of 200 subjects with intracranial ICA or M1 occlusion resulted in 81.5% AOL 2-3 recanalization, in addition to 76% mTICI 2-3 and 42.5% mTICI 2b-3 reperfusion. Adverse events included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) (8.0%), vessel perforations (1.5%), and new emboli (14.9%). EVT techniques used were standard microcatheter n=51; EKOS n=14; Merci n=77; Penumbra n=39; Solitaire n=4; multiple n=15. Good clinical outcome was associated with both TICI 2-3 and TICI 2b-3 reperfusion. Neither modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 (28.5%), nor 90-day mortality (28.5%), nor asymptomatic ICH (36.0%) differed among revascularization methods after propensity score adjustment for subjects with intracranial ICA or M1 occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Good clinical outcome was associated with good reperfusion for ICA and M1 occlusion. No significant differences in efficacy or safety among revascularization methods were demonstrated after adjustment. Lack of high-quality reperfusion, adverse events, and prolonged time to treatment contributed to lower-than-expected mRS 0-2 outcomes and study futility compared with IV rt-PA.

Alternatively, Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) is commonly expressed with higher titers, though it has lower sensitivity in serological assays. Here, we improve transient Spike expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We demonstrate that Spike titers increase significantly over the expression period, maximizing at 14 mg/L at day 7. In comparison, RBD titers peak at 54 mg/L at day 3. Next, we develop 8 Spike truncations (T1-T8) in pursuit of a truncation with high expression and antibody binding. The truncations T1 and T4 express at 130 mg/L and 73 mg/L, respectively, which are higher than our RBD titers. Purified proteins were evaluated for binding to antibodies raised against full-length Spike. T1 has similar sensitivity as Spike against a monoclonal antibody and even outperforms Spike for a polyclonal antibody.

Design: The data consist of 41 thematic one-on-one interviews conducted during MayCDecember 2020 with family members of nursing home residents. Convenience sampling was utilized by asking several nursing homes in different parts of Finland to relay a contact request from the researchers to the residents family members. The main themes of the interviews were lockdown and visiting restrictions. Subthemes included the frequency of visits, other means of interaction, changes in the relationships of family members with their loved ones and with nursing home staff, and the feelings aroused by the situation. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, resulting in 794 pages of data. Method: The qualitative study uses inductive content analysis. NVivo12 software facilitated the systematic coding of the data. Results: According to the family members, distancing aggravated the residents pre-existing conditions: they reported a sudden progression in memory disorders and significant deterioration in physical abilities, for example. Both residents and family members experienced anxiety, grief, and severe stress, and family members expressed concern that residents might die due to a lack of social contact and activity. Family members were also frustrated about not being able to touch their relatives or participate in their care, and therefore sometimes thought that their visits were useless. New forms of interaction with family members, introduced by the nursing homes, were appreciated. However, some family members perceived the interactional protocols as unfair and complained about insufficient information. Conclusions: The findings underline the need for nursing homes to implement a good interactional protocol. Overall, the results show that the measures taken to protect residents health during the Covid-19 outbreak were short-sighted in terms of the social dimension of well-being. It is therefore important to continue developing safe and humane solutions for interaction when social restrictions are in place.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive worldwide assessment of published evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers. A scoping review method was adopted to include a final pool of 35 studies in this review with study sample size ranges from n = 123 to 16,158 (average = 2185 participants per study). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy worldwide in healthcare workers ranged from 4.3 to 72% (average = 22.51% across all studies with 76,471 participants). The majority of the studies found concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and potential side effects as top reasons for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in healthcare workers. The majority of the studies also found that individuals who were males, of older age, and doctoral degree holders (i.e., physicians) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Factors such as the higher perceived risk of getting infected with COVID-19, direct care for patients, and history of influenza vaccination were also found to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake probability. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers, communication and education strategies along with mandates for clinical workers should be considered to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake in these individuals.

No prospective or randomised clinical study has yet confirmed these results. However, no study has yet prospectively specifically investigated patients in severe septic shock with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI). Therefore, we aimed to examine whether haemoadsorption could influence intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality in these patients. Furthermore, we examined the influence of haemoadsorption on length of stay in the ICU and therapeutic support. METHODS: Retrospective control group and prospective intervention group design in a tertiary hospital in central Europe (Germany). Intervention was the implementation of haemoadsorption for patients in septic shock with SA-AKI. 76 patients were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Severity of illness as depicted by APACHE II was higher in patients treated with haemoadsorption. Risk-adjusted ICU mortality rates (O/E ratios) did not differ significantly between the groups (0.80 vs. 0.83). We observed in patients treated with haemoadsorption a shorter LOS and shorter therapeutic support such as catecholamine dependency and duration of RRT. However, in multivariate analysis (logistic regression for mortality, competing risk for LOS), we found no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of haemoadsorption for patients in septic shock with acute renal failure did not lead to a reduction in ICU or hospital mortality rates. Despite univariate analysis delivering some evidence for a shorter duration of ICU-related treatments in the haemoadsorption group, these results did not remain significant in multivariate analysis.

METHODS: A purposive sampling of public health professionals in Israel, through professional and academic public health networks (N = 112). The survey was distributed online during May 2020. Level of trust was measured by the mean of 18 related statements using a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 means not at all and 5 means to a very high extent, and grouped as low and high trust by median (2.75). RESULTS: A moderate level of trust in policy was found among professionals (Mean: 2.84, 95% Cl: [2.70, 2.98]). The level of trust among public health physicians was somewhat lower than among researchers and other health professionals (Mean: 2.66 vs. 2.81 and 2.96, respectively, p = 0.286), with a higher proportion expressing low trust (70% vs. 51% and 38%, respectively, p < 0.05). Participants with a low compared to high level of trust in policy were less supportive of the use of Israel Security Agency tools for contact tracing (Mean = 2.21 vs. 3.17, p < 0.01), and reported lower levels of trust in the Ministry of Health (Mean = 2.52 vs. 3.91, p < 0.01). A strong positive correlation was found between the level of trust in policy and the level of trust in the Ministry of Health (rs = 0.782, p < 0.01). Most professionals (77%) rated their involvement in decision making as low or not at all, and they reported a lower level of trust in policy than those with high involvement (Mean = 2.76 vs. 3.12, p < 0.05). Regarding trust in the ability of agencies to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, respondents reported high levels of trust in the Association of Public Health Physicians (80%) and in hospitals (79%), but very low levels of trust in the Minister of Health (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that Israeli public health professionals exhibited moderate levels of trust in COVID-19 national public health policy and varied levels of trust in government agencies during the first wave of COVID-19. The level of trust in policy was lower among most of the participants who were not involved in decision making. The level of trust found is worrisome and should be monitored, because it may harm cooperation, professional response, and public trust.

Our hypothesis was that the SPW might be a critical component of most colonic motor functions, and hence might act as a biomarker for healthy colon motility. To that end, we performed high-resolution colonic manometry (HRCM), for the first time using an 84-sensor (1 cm spaced) water-perfused catheter, in 17 healthy volunteers. Intraluminal pressure patterns were recorded during baseline, proximal and rectal balloon distention, after a meal and following proximal and rectal luminal bisacodyl administration. Quantification was performed using software, based on Image J, developed during this study. Gas expulsion was always associated with SPWs, furthermore, SPWs were associated with water or balloon expulsion. SPWs were prominently emerging at the termination of proximal high amplitude propagating pressure waves (HAPWs); we termed this motor pattern HAPW-SPWs; hence, SPWs were often not a pan-colonic event. SPWs and HAPW-SPWs were observed at baseline with SPW amplitudes of 12.0  8.5 mmHg and 20.2  7.2 mmHg respectively. The SPW occurrence and amplitude significantly increased in response to meal, balloon distention and luminal bisacodyl, associated with 50.3% anal sphincter relaxation at baseline, which significantly increased to 59.0% after a meal, and 69.1% after bisacodyl. Often, full relaxation was achieved. The SPWs associated with gas expulsion had a significantly higher amplitude compared to SPWs without gas expulsion. SPWs could be seen to consist of clusters of high frequency pressure waves, likely associated with a cluster of fast propagating, circular muscle contractions. SPWs were occasionally observed in a highly rhythmic pattern at 1.8  1.2 cycles/min. Unlike HAPWs, the SPWs did not obliterate haustral boundaries thereby explaining how gas can be expelled while solid content can remain restrained by the haustral boundaries. In conclusion, the SPW may become a biomarker for normal gas transit, the gastrocolonic reflex and extrinsic neural reflexes. The SPW assessment reveals coordination of activities in the colon, rectum and anal sphincters. SPWs may become of diagnostic value in patients with colonic dysmotility.","output":"Characterization of Simultaneous Pressure Waves as Biomarkers for Colonic Motility Assessed by High-Resolution Colonic Manometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: Exhibit the health professionals' perception about the assistance provided during the COVID-19 pandemic mentioned television media.

These fitter SARS- CoV-2 variants often harbor multiple point mutations, conferring one or more traits that provide an evolutionary advantage, such as increased transmissibility, immune evasion and longer infection duration. In a number of cases, variant emergence has been linked to long-term infections in individuals who were either immunocompromised or treated with convalescent plasma. In this paper, we explore the mechanism by which fitter variants of SARS-CoV-2 arise during long-term infections using a mathematical model of viral evolution and identify means by which this evolution can be slowed. While viral load and infection duration play a strong role in favoring the emergence of such variants, the overall probability of emergence and subsequent transmission from any given infection is low, suggesting that viral variant emergence and establishment is a product of random chance. To the extent that luck plays a role in favoring the emergence of novel viral variants with an evolutionary advantage, targeting these low-probability random events might allow us to tip the balance of fortune away from these advantageous variants and prevent them from being established in the population.","output":"Controlling long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections is important for slowing viral evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic hepatitis B infection remains a serious global health threat, contributing to a large number of deaths through liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

A total of 6404 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected of which 3960 DEGs were upregulated and 2444 DEGs were downregulated. Specifically, genes involved in innate immune responses and chemokines and receptors associated with T-cell homing to lymphoid tissues were down regulated. As a result, homing of virus-specific T-cells to lymphoid tissues seems to be ineffective, evidenced by the lower frequencies of virus-specific T-cell in lymphoid tissue than in peripheral blood. Genes associated with T-cell exhaustion were upregulated. Likewise, genes involved in the anti-apoptotic pathway were upregulated.

In good concordance, virtual docking and molecular dynamics assays demonstrated that Pm binds to different sites at the nAChR, mostly at the transmembrane domain. Thus, Pm from Fritillaria bulbs, considered therapeutic herbs, targets nAChRs with high affinity, which might account for its anti-inflammatory actions.","output":"Peimine, an Anti-Inflammatory Compound from Chinese Herbal Extracts, Modulates Muscle-Type Nicotinic Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Immune dysregulation causes inflammation and massive production of inflammatory mediators that worsen the patients status. Here, regulatory immune cells may ameliorate inflammation and improve the severity of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 76 participants were enrolled in this study and divided into 3 groups as follows: patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 (n = 25), patients with critical COVID-19 (n = 26), and healthy controls (n = 25). After blood collection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stained by FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mABs), PE-conjugated anti-HLA-G mABs, PerCPCy5.5-conjugated anti-CD14 mABs, and APC-conjugated anti-CD8 mABs. RESULTS: Critical COVID-19 patients had a significantly lower frequency of CD4(+) HLA-G(+) T lymphocytes compared with moderate/severe COVID-19 patients (p value < 0.001; SMD, ?1.27; 95% CI [-1.86, ?0.66]) and healthy controls (p value < 0.05; SMD, ?0.69; 95% CI [-1.25, ?0.12]). Critical COVID-19 patients had a significantly lower frequency of CD14(+) HLA-G(+) monocytes compared with moderate/severe COVID-19 patients (p value < 0.001; SMD, ?2.09; 95% CI [-2.77, ?1.41]) and healthy controls (p value < 0.05; SMD, ?0.83; 95% CI [-1.40, ?0.25]). However, there was no difference between the groups regarding the frequency of CD8(+) HLA-G(+) T lymphocytes.

COVID-19 often develops life-threatening hypoxemia. Endothelial injury caused by the viral infection leads to intravascular coagulation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. However, besides above pathogenic mechanisms, the role of alveolar edema in the disease progression has not been discussed comprehensively. Since the exudation of pulmonary edema fluid was extremely serious in COVID-19 patients, we bring out a hypothesis that severity of alveolar edema may determine the size of poorly-ventilated area and the blood oxygen content. Treatments to pulmonary edema (conservative fluid management, exogenous surfactant replacements and ethanolCoxygen vapor therapy hypothetically) may be greatly helpful for reducing the occurrences of severe cases. Given that late mechanical ventilation may cause mucus (edema fluid) to be blown deep into the small airways, oxygen therapy should be given at the early stages. The optimal time and blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) threshold for oxygen therapy are also discussed.","output":"The Role of Alveolar Edema in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Increased urbanization in the developing world parallels a rising burden of chronic diseases. Developing countries account for  80% of global cardiovascular (CV) deaths, but contribute a paucity of systematic epidemiological data on CV risk factors. OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of CV risk factors in rural and urban cohorts attending general practice clinics in the Africa and Middle East (AfME) region. METHODS In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, the presence of CV risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus (diabetes), dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking and abdominal obesity) were evaluated in stable adult outpatients attending general practice primary care clinics. A rural population was defined as isolated (>50 km or lack of easy access to commuter transportation) from urban centers. RESULTS 4,378 outpatients were systematically recruited from 94 clinics across 14 AfME countries. Mean age was 46  14 years and 52% of outpatients were female. A high prevalence of dyslipidemia (70%) and abdominal obesity (68%) were observed, followed by hypertension (43%) and diabetes (25%). The vast majority of outpatients (92%) had at least one modifiable CV risk factor, many (74%) had more than one, and half (53%) had 3 or more. These findings were observed in both genders and across urban and rural centers. Among outpatients with pre-existing hypertension or dyslipidemia, many were not at their target blood pressure or LDL-cholesterol goals. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among relatively young, stable outpatients attending general practice clinics across AfME. The findings support opportunistic screening for CV risk factors whenever outpatients visit a general practitioner and provide an opportunity for early identification and management of CV risk factors, including lifestyle interventions.","output":"Cardiovascular risk factor burden in Africa and the Middle East: the Africa Middle East Cardiovascular Epidemiological (ACE) study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HLA-A, -C, -B, and -DRB1 genotypes were analyzed in 178 Japanese COVID-19 patients to investigate the association of HLA with severe COVID-19.

The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: : We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison : Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE(16.23%), MAE(37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is typically suspected but often not detected. Even if atrial fibrillation (AF) is detected, the quantitative threshold of clinically relevant AF remains unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that left atrial (LA) functional and structural abnormalities may convey a risk of ischaemic stroke in which AF is only one of several features. These abnormalities have been termed atrial cardiomyopathy. This study uses cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to evaluate atrial cardiomyopathy among patients with stroke of undetermined aetiology compared with those with an attributable mechanism and controls without established cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This cross-sectional and prospective cohort study included 100 patients with recent ischaemic stroke and 50 controls with no established cardiovascular disease. The study will assess LA structural and functional abnormalities with CMR. Inclusion began in March 2019, and follow-up is planned to be complete in January 2023. There are two scheduled follow-ups: (1) 18 months after individual inclusion, counting from the index diagnostic MRI of the brain, (2) end of study follow-up at 18 months after inclusion of the last patient, assessing the incidence of recurrent ischaemic stroke, AF and cardiovascular death. The primary endpoint is the extent of CMR-assessed atrial fibrosis in the LA at baseline.

The Discourse of Renewal framework requires a focus on what is best for the entirety of the community, rather than simply being a strategic response that only benefits a few. The framework provides a structure for conceptualizing and considering an optimistic discourse in response to crises. A rhetorical analysis of leadership discourse examined four renewal characteristics: overall organizational learning, ethical communication, prospective visioning, and effective organizational rhetoric. Surveys and subsequent analyses of faculty, students, and staff responses provide a feedback mechanism from institutional stakeholders. Subsequent discussions explore issues of navigating stacked crises and how an ethical leadership response can help build beyond crises for the future of the organization.

Older adults (65 years of age) and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of death. Since March 2020, preventive measures including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine and social distancing have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact mental and physical health. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify the impact of the \\"Stay-at-Home\\" order on older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in Southern California. METHODS: Methods: Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom communications platform during May 2020 with 21 CCSHC residents participating. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the \\"stay-at-home\\" mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data including: 1 - Impact of Quarantine on Health and Well-Being; 2 - Communication Innovation and Technology Use; 3 - Effective Ways of Coping with Quarantine; and 4 - Improving Access to Technology and Training. Participants reported a threat to their mental and physical health directly tied to quarantine and exacerbated by social isolation and decreased physical activity. Technology was identified as a lifeline for many who are socially isolated from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Technology access, connectivity, and literacy are potential game-changers to supporting the mental and physical health of older adults and must be prioritized.","output":"Health impacts of the \\"Stay at Home\\" order on community dwelling older adults and how technologies may help: A focus group study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research from financial stress, disasters, pandemics, and other extreme events, suggests that behavioral health will suffer, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.

We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those who recover from COVID-19, health-care professionals, and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption.

The placental vulnerability is pronounced before embryonic day 11, when even mild immune challenge results in fetal loss. As gestation progresses, the placenta becomes increasingly resilient to maternal inflammation, but there is a narrow window in gestation when the placenta is still vulnerable to immune challenge yet resistant enough to allow for fetal survival. This gestational window correlates with early cortical neurogenesis in the fetal brain. Here, we show that maternal illness during this period selectively alters the abundance and laminar positioning of neuronal subtypes influenced by the Tbr1, Satb2, and Ctip2/Fezf2 patterning axis. The disturbances also lead to a laminar imbalance in the proportions of projection neurons and interneurons in the adult and are sufficient to cause changes in social behavior and cognition. These data illustrate how the timing of an illness-related placental vulnerability causes developmental alterations in neuroanatomical systems and behaviors that are relevant to autism spectrum disorders.","output":"Stereotypical alterations in cortical patterning are associated with maternal illness-induced placental dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the consequences of the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the entrepreneurial intentions of academic students. In addition, this research examined whether the pandemic reinforces the tendency to operate new businesses or represents a barrier to the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted with a sample of university students. Risk perception and contextual variables were measured. Information was collected from 308 university students enrolled at the University of Sfax (Tunisia) who participated by responding to a structured questionnaire distributed in electronic form by email. Findings: The results show that university students perceive higher levels of personal entrepreneurial risk than other types of entrepreneurial risks (financial risk and social risk). Perceived financial risk only has a significant effect on entrepreneurial intention for students who view the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity. Regarding perceived contextual support, only perceived educational support has a significant and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention. Research limitations/implications: The results have important practical implications for identifying entrepreneurial intentions. They indicate that universities have an essential role in providing educational support for students by implementing awareness and training programs for entrepreneurship. Furthermore, they reveal the differentiated effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the risk perceptions of participants according to their views of the crisis as a threat or as an opportunity.

There have been classic clinical cases that have met the case definition of COVID-19 but real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to share pathological observations of autopsies performed at the 37 Military Hospitals Department of Anatomical Pathology on three presumed COVID-19 cases in Accra, Ghana. METHOD: Complete autopsies with detailed gross and histopathological analysis were conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 on three suspected COVID-19 cases, of which two had initial negative (rRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal tests. Postmortem bronchopulmonary samples of two cases were collected and tested by rRT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The two postmortem bronchopulmonary samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were positive. Though no postmortem bronchopulmonary sample was taken from the third case, a close contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in later contact tracing. For all three cases, lung histopathological findings were consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The outcome of COVID-19 testing is dependent on the sample type and accuracy of sampling amongst other factors.

Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit. METHODS Retrospective chart review of patients 22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS.

OBJECTIVE: Therefore, in this study the aim was evaluate MSD prevalence and its association with teachers' QoL perception. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total sample of 544 Chilean teachers were included in a cross-sectional study. MSD prevalence was evaluated via the Standardized Nordic Questionnaire and QoL perception via the Short-Form 36 Health Survey Instrument. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association between MSD and QoL perception adjusted for gender and age. RESULTS: A total of 91% of teachers have had some MSD in the last 12 months, and 28.86% have had 6 or more painful regions. Females showed greater MSD prevalence than males. Teachers who reported no MSD had higher QoL scores compared to teachers with MSD. The group of teachers with the most MSD (p75) saw significant increases in the risk of having low scores in the physical (OR: 2.82) and mental components (OR: 2.65) of QoL. By contrast, teachers without MSD have a buffer effect for their QoL (physical OR: 0.2; mental OR: 0.44).

In patients with chronic infection, prosthesis exchange is in theory the rule. However, this surgical approach is sometimes not desirable especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, as it could be associated with a dramatic loss of function, reduction of the bone stock, fracture, or peroperative death. We propose here to report different approaches that can help to maintain the function in such patients based on a pathophysiology-, multidisciplinary-, and an experience-based approach. METHODS We describe the different points that are needed to treat such patients: (i) the multidisciplinary care management; (ii) understanding the mechanism of bacterial persistence; (iii) optimization of the conservative surgical approach; (iv) use of suppressive antimicrobial therapy (SAT); (v) implementation of innovative agents that could be used locally to target the biofilm. RESULTS In France, a nation-wide network called CRIOAc has been created and funded by the French Health ministry to manage complex bone and joint infection. Based on the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of PJI, it seems to be feasible to propose conservative surgical treatment such as \\"debridement antibiotics and implant retention\\" (with or without soft-tissue coverage) followed by SAT to control the disease progression. Finally, there is a rational for the use of particular agents that have the ability to target the bacteria embedded in biofilm such as bacteriophages and phage lysins. DISCUSSION This multistep approach is probably a key determinant to propose innovative management in patients with complex PJI, to improve the outcome. CONCLUSION Conservative treatment has a high potential in patients with chronic PJI for whom explantation is not desirable.

Restriction-modification (RM) systems use a methyltransferase (MTase) to modify a specific sequence motif, thus protecting host DNA from cleavage by a cognate restriction endonuclease (REase) while leaving invading DNA vulnerable. Other REases occur solitarily and cleave methylated DNA. REases and RM systems are frequently mobile, influencing horizontal gene transfer by altering the compatibility of the host for foreign DNA uptake. However, whether mobile defence systems affect pre-existing host defences remains obscure. Here, we reveal an epigenetic conflict between an RM system (PcaRCI) and a methylation-dependent REase (PcaRCII) in the plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum RC5297. The PcaRCI RM system provides potent protection against unmethylated plasmids and phages, but its methylation motif is targeted by the methylation-dependent PcaRCII. This potentially lethal co-existence is enabled through epigenetic silencing of the PcaRCII-encoding gene via promoter methylation by the PcaRCI MTase. Comparative genome analyses suggest that the PcaRCII-encoding gene was already present and was silenced upon establishment of the PcaRCI system. These findings provide a striking example for selfishness of RM systems and intracellular competition between different defences.","output":"A mobile restriction-modification system provides phage defence and resolves an epigenetic conflict with an antagonistic endonuclease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Portugal took early action to control the COVID-19 epidemic, initiating lockdown measures on March 16th when it recorded only 62 cases of COVID-19 per million inhabitants and reported no deaths The Portuguese public complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80% The aim of this study was to estimate the initial impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of the reduction of the burden on the healthcare system Material and Methods: We forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in intensive care), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days alter initial lockdown was implemented We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data up to the 31st March 2020 We then compared observed (with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention) Results: Between April 1st and April 15th, there were 146 fewer deaths (-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15th, there were 519 fewer intensive care inpatients (-69%) than forecasted without the lockdown On April 15th, the number of intensive care inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed Discussion: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal intensive care capacity (528 beds) would have likely been breached during the first half of April The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, serious COVID-19 disease, and associated mortality, thus decreasing demand on health services Conclusion: An early lockdown allowed time for the National Health Service to mobilize resources and acquire personal protective equipment, increase testing, contact tracing and hospital and intensive care capacity and to promote broad prevention and control measures When lifting more stringent measures, strong surveillance and communication strategies that mobilize individual prevention efforts are necessary","output":"Initial Assessment of the Impact of the Emergency State Lockdown Measures on the 1st Wave of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE At-home monitoring of respiration is of critical urgency especially in the era of the global pandemic due to COVID-19. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and seismocardiogram (SCG) signalsmeasured in less cumbersome contact form factors than the conventional sealed mask that measures respiratory air floware promising solutions for respiratory monitoring. In particular, respiratory rates (RR) can be estimated from ECG-derived respiratory signal (EDR) and SCG-derived respiratory (SDR) signals. Yet, non-respiratory artifacts might still be present in these surrogates of respiratory signals, hindering the accuracy of the RRs estimated. METHODS In this paper, we propose a novel U-Net-based cascaded framework to address this problem. The EDR and SDR signals were transformed to the spectro-temporal domain and subsequently denoised by a 2D U-Net to reduce the non-respiratory artifacts. MAJOR RESULTS We have shown that the U-Net that fused an EDR input and an SDR input achieved a low mean absolute error of 0.82 breaths per minute (bpm) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89 using data collected from our chest-worn wearable patch. We also qualitatively provided insights on the complementariness between EDR and SDR and demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed framework. CONCLUSION ECG and SCG collected from a chest-worn wearable patch can complement each other and yield reliable RR estimation using the proposed cascaded framework. SIGNIFICANCE We anticipate that convenient and comfortable ECG and SCG measurement systems can be augmented with this framework to facilitate pervasive and accurate RR measurement.","output":"Respiratory Rate Estimation using U-Net-Based Cascaded Framework from Electrocardiogram and Seismocardiogram Signals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flipped teaching (FT) has gained attention due to its method of teaching that allows students to learn basic concepts on their own using instructor\\\\provided resources before their scheduled class time. The class time is used in rehearsing and applying the knowledge using active learning approaches. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic caused an unexpected shift from face\\\\to\\\\face to remote learning during the middle of the spring 2020 semester challenging both students and faculty. This study examined the transition of students from the flipped classroom method to rapid online learning and whether the transition was dependent on the faculty experience with FT. The perception of the transition of students in the classrooms of faculty (n=12) with extensive experience in FT (cohort 1) was compared with that of a second cohort (n=11) who were in their first semester of FT implementation. Both qualitative and quantitative survey data were collected from 23 classrooms (n=256 students). It was found that the students in the courses taught by cohort 1 who had received intensive FT training and implemented FT in semesters prior to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic were able to facilitate a smoother transition and adjustment to fully online learning for their students compared to the students in the courses taught by cohort 2 (p< 0.01). The qualitative data analysis suggested that the students participating in the FT courses in the first half of the semester, before the pandemic, had an easier transition to fully online learning. Students also expressed concerns that online learning was affected by the lack of interaction with faculty and peers, lack of motivation, issues with time management, and personal and technological demands. In conclusion, this study found that faculty experience with FT helped ease the transition of students from the face\\\\to\\\\face FT to the online format during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.","output":"Flipped Teaching Eased the Transition of Students to Online Learning During the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected shopping behavior and has accelerated the adoption of online shopping and home deliveries. We administered an online survey among the population in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro Metropolitan area on household and demographic characteristics, e-commerce preferences and factors, number of deliveries made before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, and number of deliveries expected to make post-pandemic. In this research, we conduct an exploratory analysis of the factors that affect home delivery levels before, during, and post-COVID-19. There was a significant increase in home deliveries during the COVID-19 lockdown relative to the before COVID-19 period. A high proportion of the households that made less than three deliveries per month before the pandemic stated they would order more online post-pandemic. A majority of the households that ordered more than three deliveries per month before COVID-19 are expected to revert to their original levels post-pandemic. The two variables most positively affecting the likelihood of online shopping were access to delivery subscriptions and income. Tech-savvy individuals are expected to make more home delivery orders post-pandemic compared to before and during COVID-19. Health concerns positively increase the likelihood of ordering online during the pandemic and post-pandemic. Older and retired individuals are less likely to use online deliveries. However, the likelihood of older and retired individuals ordering more home deliveries increased during the pandemic lockdown. Households with disabled members, single workers, and respondents concerned about online experience and health are more likely to be first-time online shoppers during the pandemic.","output":"Exploratory analysis of factors affecting levels of home deliveries before, during, and post- COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lectin sensitivity of the recent pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1-2009) was screened for 12 lectins with various carbohydrate specificity by a neutral red dye uptake assay with MDCK cells. Among them, a high mannose (HM)-binding anti-HIV lectin, ESA-2 from the red alga Eucheuma serra, showed the highest inhibition against infection with an EC(50) of 12.4 nM. Moreover, ESA-2 exhibited a wide range of antiviral spectrum against various influenza strains with EC(50)s of pico molar to low nanomolar levels. Besides ESA-2, HM-binding plant lectin ConA, fucose-binding lectins such as fungal AOL from Aspergillus oryzae and AAL from Aleuria aurantia were active against H1N1-2009, but the potency of inhibition was of less magnitude compared with ESA-2. Direct interaction between ESA-2 and a viral envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), was demonstrated by ELISA assay. This interaction was effectively suppressed by glycoproteins bearing HM-glycans, indicating that ESA-2 binds to the HA of influenza virus through HM-glycans. Upon treatment with ESA-2, no viral antigens were detected in the host cells, indicating that ESA-2 inhibited the initial steps of virus entry into the cells. ESA-2 would thus be useful as a novel microbicide to prevent penetration of viruses such as HIV and influenza viruses to the host cells.","output":"Entry Inhibition of Influenza Viruses with High Mannose Binding Lectin ESA-2 from the Red Alga Eucheuma serra through the Recognition of Viral Hemagglutinin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing refers to actions or steps taken by an individual or groups of individuals with the main purpose of reducing physical and social interaction to curb the spread of infectious disease.

A non-probability sampling method was used for this study;data were generated from respondents who filled an online form distributed on all social media platforms. All respondents living in Nigeria were included in the study while those living outside at the time of the survey were excluded. Results from the survey revealed that most Nigerians are knowledgeable about social distancing guidelines but observed low or non-adherence to the rules. This non-compliance was partly attributed to poor knowledge of the guidelines due to inadequate information from the government, and majorly due to lack of basic amenities, poverty and hunger. Further research and policies on the best avenue of reaching this group of Nigerians with a substantial economic package, an improvement on information dissemination on social distancing guidelines will make a great difference.

Most of the workforce started working from home and resource consumption significantly shifted towards the domestic sector. The ensuing confinement protocols caused a shift in everyday life, which in turn significantly altered the energy supply and demand landscape. This event, although catastrophic in terms of loss of human life and economic development, can provide us with valuable data to study the potential of new strategies to achieve EU 2050 Energy goals. It was investigated whether the pandemic has opened a path and provided us with a partial answer to decarbonization in the form of home office practices as a possible energy efficiency measure. The present study shows that, in Portugal, there was a 15.7% reduction of primary energy consumption (accounting for electricity, natural gas and transport fuels) compared to 2019.

While a large number of cases and mortality rates direct the research to the clinic and prognosis of the disease, the mental health of these patients has recently become a matter of concern. This study aims to predict psychiatric morbidity and possible associated markers in COVID-19 survivors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 102 survivors with COVID-19 infection participated in this study. A questionnaire was applied to the participants to evaluate demographic variables, history of comorbid diseases, smoking, loss of a relative due to COVID-19, and environmental attitudes after the discharge. Length of hospitalization, lung findings, intensive care history and treatments were recorded. Psychiatric morbidities were evaluated with General Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and The National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale. RESULTS: Anxiety was found in 20.6%, depression in 13.7% based on moderate and above levels, 21.6% had significant PTSD. Female gender, history of psychiatric and comorbid diseases, smoking, perceived discrimination, and lack of long-lasting immunity posed a risk in terms of psychological response. There was a negative correlation between age and depression scores. No relation was found between the duration of hospitalization, presence of lung involvement, receiving intensive care treatment, losing a relative due to COVID-19 and psychological response. CONCLUSIONS: On patients treated for COVID-19 infection, psychological response continue after discharge. Mental health support and efforts to reduce stigma among infected subjects can reduce the psychological impact caused by the pandemic.","output":"Assessment of Psychological Responses and Related Factors of Discharged Patients Who Have Been Hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In Italy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination is achievable; however, barriers remain to achieving the World Health Organization's elimination targets, and have become more pronounced with the spread of COVID-19. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) is a direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV, approved for 8-week treatment in patients without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis (CC). Previously, 12 weeks of therapy was recommended for patients with CC. Shortened treatment may reduce the burden on healthcare resources, allowing more patients to be treated. This study presents the benefits that 8-week vs 12-week treatment with G/P may have in Italy. METHODS: A multicohort Markov model was used to assess the collective number of healthcare visits and time on treatment with 8-week vs 12-week G/P in the HCV-infected population of Italy from 2019 to 2030, using healthcare resource data from post-marketing observational studies of G/P. Increased treatment capacity and downstream clinical and economic benefits were also assessed assuming the reallocation of saved healthcare visits to treat more patients. RESULTS: Modeled outcomes showed that by 2030, 8-week treatment saved 27,006 years on therapy compared with 12-week treatment, with 21,065 fewer hepatologist visits. Reallocating these resources to treat more patients could increase capacity to treat 5064 (1.4%) more patients with 8 weeks of G/P, all with CC. This increased treatment capacity would further avoid 2257 cases of end-stage liver disease, 893 liver-related deaths, and provide net savings to the healthcare system of nearly ?70 million. CONCLUSION: The modeled comparisons between 8- and 12-week treatment with G/P show that shorter treatment duration can lead to greater time and resource savings, both in terms of healthcare visits and downstream costs. These benefits have the potential to enable the treatment of more patients to overcome elimination barriers in Italy through programs aimed to engage and treat targeted HCV populations.","output":"Addressing HCV Elimination Barriers in Italy: Healthcare Resource Utilization and Cost Impact Using 8 Weeks' Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of COVID-19, medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) based diagnosis is proved to be an effective way to fight against the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is important to study computerized models for infectious detection based on CT imaging. New deep learning-based approaches are developed for CT assisted diagnosis of COVID-19. However, most of the current studies are based on a small size dataset of COVID-19 CT images as there are less publicly available datasets for patient privacy reasons. As a result, the performance of deep learning-based detection models needs to be improved based on a small size dataset. In this paper, a stacked autoencoder detector model is proposed to greatly improve the performance of the detection models such as precision rate and recall rate. Firstly, four autoencoders are constructed as the first four layers of the whole stacked autoencoder detector model being developed to extract better features of CT images. Secondly, the four autoencoders are cascaded together and connected to the dense layer and the softmax classifier to constitute the model. Finally, a new classification loss function is constructed by superimposing reconstruction loss to enhance the detection accuracy of the model. The experiment results show that our model is performed well on a small size COVID-2019 CT image dataset. Our model achieves the average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score rate of 94.7%, 96.54%, 94.1%, and 94.8%, respectively. The results reflect the ability of our model in discriminating COVID-19 images which might help radiologists in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients.","output":"Stacked-autoencoder-based model for COVID-19 diagnosis on CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To investigate symptoms of infections and their risk factors among French medical students undertaking an internship abroad.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted RT-PCR results, clinical history, and CXRs of all patients from a single institution between March and June 2020. 984 RT-PCR positive and 1043 RT-PCR negative radiographs were reviewed by 10 emergency radiologists from 4 academic centers. 100 cases were read by all radiologists and 1927 cases by 2 radiologists. Each radiologist chose the single best label per case: Normal, COVID-19, Other C Infectious, Other C Noninfectious, Non-diagnostic, and Endotracheal Tube. Cases labeled with endotracheal tube (246) or non-diagnostic (54) were excluded. Remaining cases were analyzed for label distribution, clinical history, and inter-reader agreement. RESULTS: 1727 radiographs (732 RT-PCR positive, 995 RT-PCR negative) were included from 1594 patients (51.2% male, 48.8% female, age 59  19 years). For 89 cases read by all readers, there was poor agreement for RT-PCR positive (Fleiss Score 0.36) and negative (Fleiss Score 0.46) exams.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Any design with animal or human models examining a currently prescribed UK drug compared with a control, placebo or sham group, and reporting an effect on ACE2 level, activity or gene expression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1 April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk-of-bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for human studies. RESULTS: We screened 3360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and one hundred and two were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (n=55) and ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (n=22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel blockers (n=3) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists (n=2) and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of the academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty among patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects.

Much of the concern boils down to the question-just how effective are face coverings? One means to address this question is to review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and coverings operate-steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic capture. We enquire as to what extent these can be used to predict the efficacy of coverings. We combine the predictions of the models of these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter. Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton fabrics to show that three-layered cloth masks can be constructed with comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions. Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimize leakage.","output":"Efficacy of face coverings in reducing transmission of COVID-19: Calculations based on models of droplet capture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak introduced self-isolation and social distancing as measures to reduce the spreading of the pandemic.

Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [] d [] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%).

Infection with external microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, induces the release and production of inflammatory mediators, which drive acute cerebellar inflammation. The clinical observation of acute cerebellitis is associated with the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In our animal model of the acute inflammation of the cerebellar cortex, animals did not show any ataxia but hyperexcitability in the cerebellar cortex and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, animal models with neurodegeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells and hypoexcitability of the neurons show cerebellar ataxia. The suppression of the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels in vivo is associated with a type of ataxia. Therefore, there is a gap in our interpretation between the very early phase of cerebellar inflammation and the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In this review, we discuss the hypothesized scenario concerning the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. First, compared with genetically induced cerebellar ataxias, we introduce infection and inflammation in the cerebellum via aberrant immunity and glial responses. Especially, we focus on infections with cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2, potential relevance to mitochondrial DNA, and autoimmunity in infection. Second, we review neurophysiological modulation (intrinsic excitability, excitatory, and inhibitory synaptic transmission) by inflammatory mediators and aberrant immunity.

CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between patient sociodemographics and neighborhood disadvantage with frequencies of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four hospitals in an integrated health system serving southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. MAIN MEASURES: Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes were collected. Neighborhood socioeconomic variables were obtained at the census tract level from the 2018 American Community Survey. Relationships between neighborhood median income and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, obesity, smoking status, and living environment. KEY RESULTS: Black patients lived in significantly poorer neighborhoods than White patients (median income: $34,758 (24,531C56,095) vs. $63,317 (49,850C85,776), p < 0.001) and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (19.4% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). Patients from neighborhoods with lower median income were significantly more likely to require IMV (lowest quartile: 25.4%, highest quartile: 16.0%, p < 0.001) and ICU admission (35.2%, 19.9%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher neighborhood income ($10,000 increase) remained a significant negative predictor for IMV (OR: 0.95 (95% CI 0.91, 0.99), p = 0.02) and ICU admission (OR: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89, 0.96), p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood disadvantage, which is closely associated with race, is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

One of the measures that has been taken to curb the spread of the virus is blanket stay-at-home orders. Staying at home significantly limits close contact with others and can, thus, decrease the number of new cases. However, if people refrain from going out, this will cause significant economic damage. For this reason, some people think that these orders should be revoked after a short period of time, and people should get out more often. However, if blanket stay-at-home restrictions are lifted before a significant decrease is seen in the number of new cases, the number of infected people is likely to increase within a short period. This will, in turn, hasten the next round of blanket stay-at-home orders and lead to a further reduction in people who can leave their home. Against this backdrop, this study examines below phenomena, through a multi-agent simulation. The early removal strategies of stay-at-home orders for increasing the number of people leaving their homes have the effect of both increasing and decreasing the number of such people. Therefore, we consider the strategies do not lead to a sufficient increase in the overall number of people leaving their homes. To examine these phenomena, we conducted the simulations that consist of six scenarios with the different removal condition of stay-at-home orders. As a result, we could confirm that when more removal conditions of stay-at-home orders were eased, the tendencies of more number of infected people and death people were increasing with some exceptions. In contrast, there were almost no differences among the numbers of people leaving their home of these scenarios.

A clinical case is used to illustrate how information from this article can be applied. Characteristics of ME/CFS that make addressing suicidality challenging include absence of any disease-modifying treatments, severe functional limitations, and symptoms which limit therapies. Decades-long misattribution of ME/CFS to physical deconditioning or psychiatric disorders have resulted in undereducated healthcare professionals, public stigma, and unsupportive social interactions.

This project aimed to determine the feasibility of GMB in a resource-limited setting and to use GMB to describe key barriers and facilitators to effective acute care delivery at a tertiary care hospital in Malawi. METHODS: Over 1 week, trained facilitators led three GMB sessions with two groups of healthcare providers to facilitate shared understanding of structures and relationships that determine system behaviors. One group aimed to identify factors that impact patient flow in the paediatric special care ward. The other aimed to identify factors impacting delivery of high-quality care in the paediatric accident and emergency room. Synthesized causal maps of factors influencing patient care were generated, revised, and qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Causal maps identified patient condition as the central modifier of acute care delivery. Severe illness and high volume of patients were identified as creating system strain in several domains: (1) physical space, (2) resource needs and utilization, (3) staff capabilities and (4) quality improvement. Stress in these domains results in worsening patient condition and perpetuating negative reinforcing feedback loops. Balancing factors inherent to the current system included (1) parental engagement, (2) provider resilience, (3) ease of communication and (4) patient death. Perceived strengths of the GMB process were representation of diverse stakeholder viewpoints and complex system synthesis in a visual causal pathway, the process inclusivity, development of shared understanding, new idea generation and momentum building.

Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified, but the factors influencing the immune system against COVID-19 have not been well established. Upon infection or cell damage, high amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released from damaged cells, which serve as mediators of inflammation through purinergic cell surface receptor signaling. As a protective mechanism to prevent excessive damage to host tissue, adenosine counteracts ATP's effects by adenosine receptor stimulation to suppress the pro-inflammatory response. Adenosine is seen as a major obstacle to the efficacy of immune therapies, and the adenosinergic axis components are critical therapeutic targets for cancer and microbial infections. Pharmacologic inhibitors or antibodies specific to adenosinergic pathway components or adenosine receptors in microbial and tumor therapy have shown efficacy in pre-clinical studies and are entering the clinical arena.

Life expectancy is based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study life tables for 2019. Results There were 220,273 confirmed cases with a total of 4,500 deaths as a direct result of COVID-19. DALYs were estimated to be 51,532.1 (95% Uncertainty Intervals [UI] 50,671.6, 52,294.3). Overall, YLL contributed to 98.7% of the DALYs. Of total symptomatic cases, 6.5% required hospitalisation and of those hospitalised 10.8% required intensive care unit treatment. COVID-19 was likely to be the second highest cause of death over our study's duration.

With the genetic sequence data of the nCoV already available since January 10, 2020, leading pharmaceutical companies, world over, in turn, have started working on the clinical trials to produce vaccines against this nCoV. In fact, many vaccines under the Phase III trial have claimed to demonstrate their efficacy to be as high as 95% against the nCoV. In January, the central drugs standard control organization, India had granted the emergency-use authorization [EUA] to two vaccines namely, Covishield (live vaccine, Oxford-AstraZeneca, United Kingdom being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, Pune) and Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India). Although, most of the countries offer no deferral period for the donors who have been administered an inactivated vaccine against this nCoV. However, the national blood transfusion council of India has recently recommended a donor deferral period of 28 days from the last dose of vaccination. This could essentially lead to a massive loss of eligible blood donors and jeopardize the already disrupted blood supply management due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors, herein, propose a thorough redefining of this deferral period post-vaccination amongst the Indian blood donors.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination in the Indian blood donors: Adjudging the impact on the deferral period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a conversational chatbots solution allowing, in the context of covid-19, to support, detect and reduce deficiencies and bring students to self-training in order to develop their skills.

Precautions such as restrictions imposed on visitors and social distancing have led to multiple challenges, particularly in terms of communication. Using the case of nursing, palliative and hospice care facilities in Germany and drawing on agenda-setting theory, the present study aims to shed light on how health care facilities use their websites to inform (potential) health care users about changes in regulations, new protective measures implemented and about recommendations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : The websites of nursing, palliative and hospice care facilities in Germany were examined using qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis. A total of 138 websites was analysed in the study. The data gathered includes all the information about COVID-19 on these websites published from the beginning of March until August 15, 2020. Results: : Facilities show similarities in adhering to the measures taken by the authorities to restrict the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to protect vulnerable patients and employees. The message of avoiding to pay visits to patients in facilities unless there was an emergency was shared between facilities;however, visiting procedures in practice varied by types of facilities. For optimal communication, telephone and especially video calls were the options preferred by healthcare providers and health care users. Facilities made great efforts to prevent emotional stress and to strengthen resilience among all stakeholders. Transparency was adopted by many facilities in order to build the publics trust. Conclusion: The agenda of health care facilities has been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study sheds light on the strategies developed by facilities, their efforts to increase emotional resilience among health care staff and health care users, the ethical guidelines they have adopted regarding privacy policies as well as how these themes are communicated via the facilities websites. The results can inform other health care facilities about how websites can be used as essential communication tools in times of public health crises.","output":"We Are Taking Every Precaution to Do Our Part...: A Comparative Analysis of Nursing, Palliative and Hospice Care Facilities Websites During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes have been detected in wastewater worldwide. However, the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in wastewater has been limited due to the stringent requirements of biosafety level 3. The main objective of this study is to investigate the applicability of capsid integrity RT-qPCR for the selective detection of intact SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Three capsid integrity reagents, namely ethidium monoazide (EMA, 0.1C100 M), propidium monoazide (PMA, 0.1C100 M), and cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (CDDP, 0.1C1000 M), were tested for their effects on different forms (including free genomes, intact and heat-inactivated) of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which was used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. CDDP at a concentration of 100 M was identified as the most efficient reagent for the selective detection of infectious MHV by RT-qPCR (CDDP-RT-qPCR). Next, two common virus concentration methods including ultrafiltration (UF) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation were investigated for their compatibility with capsid integrity RT-qPCR. The UF method was more suitable than the PEG method since it recovered intact MHV (mean  SD, 38%  29%) in wastewater much better than the PEG method did (0.013%  0.015%). Finally, CDDP-RT-qPCR was compared with RT-qPCR alone for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 16 raw wastewater samples collected in the Greater Tokyo Area. Five samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 when evaluated by RT-qPCR alone. However, intact SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only three positive samples when determined by CDDP-RT-qPCR. Although CDDP-RT-qPCR was unable to determine the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, this method could improve the interpretation of positive results of SARS-CoV-2 obtained by RT-qPCR.","output":"Capsid integrity RT-qPCR for the selective detection of intact SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adjustment disorder with anxiety (ADA) is a common psychiatric pathology worldwide, but it is often undertreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment, but very few studies have been carried out for the treatment of ADA. Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) appears to be an effective treatment option, with the potential to reach a larger proportion of individuals suffering from ADA. Guidance is a beneficial feature of iCBT, provided in most studies by email or telephone (traditional guided iCBT). Blended CBT, which combines an online intervention and therapeutic guidance provided in person (face-to-face), could be a way to benefit from both the advantages of face-to-face CBT regarding human interactional quality and the advantages of internet-based CBT in terms of improved access to treatment. In this randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of two forms of administration of Seren@ctif, a 5-week CBT program for patients with ADA according the DSM-5, was examined: one delivered through face-to-face sessions (face-to-face CBT) and the other delivered online and guided with face-to-face contact with a nurse (blended CBT); these formats were compared with a wait-list control group (WLC). A total of 120 patients were included and randomized to one of these three conditions. Measures were administered before treatment, after treatment and 6 months after inclusion in the study. Both treatment conditions displayed significant decreases in anxiety, depression, worry and perceived stress at posttreatment when compared to the WLC group. The decrease in symptoms was mostly maintained 6 months after inclusion for the two experimental groups. Blended CBT showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety and depression than did face-to-face CBT on some secondary outcome measures. We conclude that both face-to-face CBT and blended CBT are effective treatments for patients with ADA, and we suggest that blended CBT may be slightly more effective than classical face-to-face CBT.

The entirety of an individual's BCRs, often referred to as an antibody repertoire, shapes the humoral immune system. Therefore, technologies to identify and characterize antibody repertoires are critical for understanding fundamental aspects of the development and maintenance of the humoral immune system. Recently, innovative methodologies and technologies devoted to high-throughput sequencing of antibody repertoires (Ig-Seq) have broadened the understanding of humoral immunity. This review provides an overview of the Ig-Seq pipeline from sample collection, library preparation, and sequencing, to data cleaning, sequence alignment, and high-level processing. Conventional and current strategies used in Ig-Seq are introduced in detail, including bulk BCR sequencing, heavy and light chain paired sequencing combined with proteomic or single B cell sequencing approaches, antigen-specific single B cell sequencing, and single-molecule sequencing. Applications of Ig-Seq are also discussed, including antibody diversity measurement, signatures associated with different populations, novel findings involved in the antibody repertoire development, and strategies of functional antibody discovery from antibody repertoires.

We have previously shown that mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunomodulator, has antiviral activity against influenza A/WSN/1933(H1N1) using a high-throughput chemical screening assay. This study further investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of MPA against contemporary clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses. The 50 % cellular cytotoxicity (CC50) of MPA in Madin Darby canine kidney cell line was over 50 M. MPA prevented influenza virus-induced cell death in the cell-protection assay, with significantly lower IC50 for influenza B virus B/411 than that of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus H1/415 (0.208 vs 1.510 M, P=0.0001). For H1/415, MPA interfered with the early stage of viral replication before protein synthesis. For B/411, MPA may also act at a later stage since MPA was active against B/411 even when added 12 h post-infection. Virus-yield reduction assay showed that the replication of B/411 was completely inhibited by MPA at concentrations 0.78 M, while there was a dose-dependent reduction of viral titer for H1/415. The antiviral effect of MPA was completely reverted by guanosine supplementation. Plaque reduction assay showed that MPA had antiviral activity against eight different clinical isolates of A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H7N9) and influenza B viruses (IC50 <1 M). In summary, MPA has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against human and avian-origin influenza viruses, in addition to its immunomodulatory activity. Together with a high chemotherapeutic index, the use of MPA as an antiviral agent should be further investigated in vivo.","output":"Mycophenolic acid, an immunomodulator, has potent and broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against pandemic, seasonal and avian influenza viruses affecting humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complement system is an ancient part of innate immunity sensing highly pathogenic coronaviruses by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) resulting in lectin pathway activation and subsequent generation of the anaphylatoxins (ATs) C3a and C5a as important effector molecules.

Community pharmacists were recruited via direct emails to pharmacy groups and social media between November 2019 and January 2020. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were conducted. KEY FINDINGS: Data were analysed from 85 pharmacists (of 115 total pharmacy staff respondents). Although 40% reported working in a pharmacy that promoted mental well-being, most (88.2%) were not involved in such activities. However, most respondents (88.0%) identified community pharmacy as a suitable setting to promote mental well-being. Barriers to mental well-being promotion included busy pharmacy environment with competing priorities, a lack of staff training and confidence in discussing mental well-being and stigma associated with mental illness.

This review shows that psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an association with post-COVID-19 infection. The exact cause of these psychiatric sequelae is yet to be determined, but it seems to involve environmental, psychological, and biological factors. Although there are variations in terms of risk factors and the prevalence rate of these psychological symptoms, risk factors including the female gender and having a history of psychiatric disorders appears to be consistent a across few studies, and there are studies showing a higher prevalence rate among post-COVID-19 survivors than among the general population. A therapeutic intervention commonly used to alleviate these psychological symptoms are psychotropic medications, but probiotics could be a safe adjunctive treatment to improve these symptoms. ABSTRACT: There is growing evidence of studies associating COVID-19 survivors with increased mental health consequences. Mental health implications related to a COVID-19 infection include both acute and long-term consequences. Here we discuss COVID-19-associated psychiatric sequelae, particularly anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), drawing parallels to past coronavirus outbreaks. A literature search was completed across three databases, using keywords to search for relevant articles. The cause may directly correlate to the infection through both direct and indirect mechanisms, but the underlying etiology appears more complex and multifactorial, involving environmental, psychological, and biological factors. Although most risk factors and prevalence rates vary across various studies, being of the female gender and having a history of psychiatric disorders seem consistent. Several studies will be presented, demonstrating COVID-19 survivors presenting higher rates of mental health consequences than the general population. The possible mechanisms by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the brain, affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and causing these psychiatric sequelae, will be discussed, particularly concerning the SARS-CoV-2 entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and the implications of the immune inflammatory signaling on neuropsychiatric disorders. Some possible therapeutic options will also be considered.","output":"Psychological Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients: Insights into Pathophysiology and Risk Factors of Long COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elevated core temperature constitutes an important biomarker for COVID-19 infection; however, no standards currently exist to monitor fever using wearable peripheral temperature sensors. Evidence that sensors could be used to develop fever monitoring capabilities would enable large-scale health-monitoring research and provide high-temporal resolution data on fever responses across heterogeneous populations. We launched the TemPredict study in March of 2020 to capture continuous physiological data, including peripheral temperature, from a commercially available wearable device during the novel coronavirus pandemic. We coupled these data with symptom reports and COVID-19 diagnosis data. Here we report findings from the first 50 subjects who reported COVID-19 infections. These cases provide the first evidence that illness-associated elevations in peripheral temperature are observable using wearable devices and correlate with self-reported fever. Our analyses support the hypothesis that wearable sensors can detect illnesses in the absence of symptom recognition. Finally, these data support the hypothesis that prediction of illness onset is possible using continuously generated physiological data collected by wearable sensors. Our findings should encourage further research into the role of wearable sensors in public health efforts aimed at illness detection, and underscore the importance of integrating temperature sensors into commercially available wearables.","output":"Feasibility of continuous fever monitoring using wearable devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of cheap and eco-friendly functional materials for the removal of anionic heavy metal ions is still challenging in the treatment of heavy metal-contaminated water. Herein, a new poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite (PATMAC-CTS-BC) was introduced for the removal of selenate (SeO42-) in water. Results suggest that the PATMAC-CTS-BC showed a rapid removal of SeO42- with efficiency of >97% within 10 min and it followed a pseudo-second-order model. High capacity of SeO42- adsorption by the composite was achieved, with maximum value of 98.99 mgg-1 based on Langmuir model, considerably higher than most of reported adsorbents. The thermodynamic results reflected the spontaneous and exothermic nature of SeO42- adsorption onto the composite. The composite could be applied at a wide initial pH range (2-10) with high removal efficiency of SeO42- because of permanent positive charges of quaternary ammonium groups (=N+-). The removal mechanisms of SeO42- were mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions with =N+- and protonated -NH3+ groups, and redox-complexation interactions with -NH2, -NH-, and -OH groups. Besides SeO42-, the hexavalent chromium (Cr2O72-) was considered as example to further demonstrate the anion removal capability of cationic hydrogel-BC composite. The study outcomes open up new opportunities to efficiently remove anionic heavy metal ions (e.g., SeO42- and Cr2O72-) in water using these materials.","output":"Efficient removal of selenate in water by cationic poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In vivo and in vitro mononuclear phagocytic system functions, expression of lymphocyte subset cell surface markers in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius, and lymphocyte subset dynamics during the course of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) were examined. PEMS is an acute, transmissible, infectious intestinal disease accompanied by high mortality and morbidity. The etiology of this multifactorial disease remains to be elucidated; however, turkey coronavirus was initially assumed to be one of the primary agents involved. Further investigation demonstrated that turkey coronavirus was not always detectable in poults exhibiting PEMS symptoms, and, thus, PEMS poults began to be identified as positive or negative for turkey coronavirus. In each trial, uninfected hatchmate controls were compared with turkey poults that were contact exposed to PEMS poults at 7 days of age. Following intravenous inoculation, control poults cleared Escherichia coli from their circulation by 60 min, whereas viable E. coli were still present in the circulation of PEMS poults at 60 min postinoculation. Inflammatory response measured by Sephadex-elicited abdominal exudate cell recruitment and the adherence potential of abdominal exudate cells was not significantly different between uninfected and PEMS poults. The percentage of glass-adherent abdominal exudate macrophages was higher in PEMS poults. However, the ability of these macrophages to phagocytize sheep red blood cells and the average number of sheep red blood cells per phagocytic macrophage were both lower compared with uninfected controls. CD4+ expression in thymic tissue of PEMS poults at 9 days postinfection was significantly lower. The CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood leukocytes from coronavirus-negative PEMS poults was lower than that from both uninfected and coronavirus-positive PEMS poults at 14 days postinfection. In the spleen, the CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio was higher in coronavirus-positive PEMS poults as compared with the other treatments. In conclusion, immune system dysfunction in PEMS is associated with impaired mononuclear phagocytic system function and alterations in lymphocyte populations.","output":"Alterations in the lymphocytic and mononuclear phagocytic systems of turkey poults associated with exposure to poult enteritis and mortality syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thioguanine (TG) is a thiopurine which has been used for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who have failed azathioprine (AZA) or mercaptopurine (MP) due to adverse events or suboptimal response. Its widespread use has been hampered due to concerns about nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose TG therapy in IBD patients failing AZA and MP. METHODS: A retrospective multicentre study was performed in IBD patients who failed prior treatment with conventional thiopurines with or without following immunomodulation (thiopurine-allopurinol, biologicals, methotrexate, tacrolimus) and were subsequently treated with TG as rescue monotherapy between 2003 and 2019 at three hospitals in the United Kingdom. Clinical response, adverse events, laboratory results, imaging and liver biopsies were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients (57% female and 64% Crohns disease) were included, with a median daily TG dose of 20 mg (range: 20C40 mg), a median treatment duration of 23 months (IQR 10C47) and a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 22C53). The clinical response rate at 12 months was 65 and 54% remained on TG until the end of follow-up. Adverse events consisted primarily of elevated liver tests (6%), myelotoxicity (7%) and rash (5%). NRH was histologically diagnosed in two patients and two other patients (1%) developed non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The median 6-TGN and TPMT levels were 953 pmol/8  10(5) RBC (IQR 145C1761) and 47 mu/L (IQR 34.5C96). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up suggests that TG can be an effective and well-tolerated therapy in more than half of difficult-to-treat and multi-therapy failing IBD patients. Findings of this study indicate that TG can be used safely and the occurrence of hepatotoxicity was low. The incidence rate of NRH was within the background incidence.","output":"Efficacy, safety and drug survival of thioguanine as maintenance treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: a retrospective multi-centre study in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To circumvent time-consuming clinical trials, testing whether existing drugs are effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, has led to the discovery of Remdesivir.

Alcohol-use disorder was associated with evidence of advanced innate immune activation, alterations in monocyte phenotype including increased expression of Toll-like receptor 4, increased burden of stimulatory ligands for Toll-like receptor 4, and alterations in plasma cytokine signature, most notably elevations in soluble CD40 ligand and transforming growth factor beta. Alcohol-associated immune activation was more pronounced among individuals with hepatitis C virus co-infection. Although the 1-month intervention to treat alcohol use disorder did not result in significant reductions in the interrogated indicators of immune activation, our findings suggest that chronic alcohol exposure is a major modifiable risk factor for chronic immune activation and dysregulation among people-living with HIV.","output":"Chronic Alcohol Exposure Among People Living with HIV Is Associated with Innate Immune Activation and Alterations in Monocyte Phenotype and Plasma Cytokine Profile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction et but de ltude La sarcopnie est un facteur de mauvais pronostic dans diffrentes pathologies.

Analysis involved a range of univariate and multivariate techniques examining the impact of demographic variables and negative affect on consumption and acquisition outcomes. Results: In both surveys (May and July), UK women scored higher than Australian women on the AUDIT-C, and residence in the UK was found to independently predict stockpiling of alcohol (RR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.91).

Therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are an integral part of any such management strategy and there is a substantial unmet need for treatments for individuals most at risk of severe disease. This perspective review provides rationale of a combined therapeutic regimen of selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor antagonism and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition to treat COVID-19. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor with pro-inflammatory and atherosclerotic effects. It is upregulated in a number of conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Endothelin mediates vasocontractility via endothelin (ET-A and ET-B) receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). ET-B receptors regulate endothelin clearance and are present on endothelial cells, where in contrast to their role on VSMCs, mediate vasodilation. Therefore, selective endothelin-A (ET-A) receptor inhibition is likely the optimal approach to attenuate the injurious effects of endothelin and may reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch and pulmonary inflammation, whilst improving pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygenation. SGLT-2 inhibition may dampen inflammatory cytokines, reduce hyperglycaemia if present, improve endothelial function, cardiovascular haemodynamics and cellular bioenergetics. This combination therapeutic approach may therefore have beneficial effects to mitigate both the pulmonary, metabolic and cardiorenal manifestations of COVID-19. Given these drug classes include medicines licensed to treat heart failure, diabetes and pulmonary hypertension respectively, information regarding their safety profile is established. Randomised controlled clinical trials are the best way to determine efficacy and safety of these medicines in COVID-19.","output":"Endothelin antagonism and sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibition.

Longitudinal changes were investigated for all outcome variables with repeated-measures models.

RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in any outcomes over the 6 months of observations. However, post hoc analyses showed that the length of social isolation before T0 was negatively correlated with episodic and semantic memory performance at T0. Carers reporting worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms and faster disease progression in PWD also reported higher burden. Moreover, carer-reported worsening of cognitive symptoms was associated with poorer semantic memory at T0. CONCLUSION: PWDs symptoms and carers burden remained stable over 6 months of observation. However, the amount of time spent under social restrictions before T0 appears to have had a significant detrimental impact on cognitive performance of patients. In fact, carer-reported cognitive decline during social isolation was consistent with the finding of poorer semantic memory, a domain sensitive to progression in Alzheimers disease. Therefore, the initial stricter period of social isolation had greater detrimental impact on patients and their carers, followed then by a plateau. Future interventions may be designed to maintain an optimal level of social and cognitive engagement for PWD in challenging times, to prevent abrupt worsening of symptoms and associated detrimental consequences on patients carers.","output":"The Impact of Social Isolation Due to COVID-19 on Symptom Progression in People With Dementia: Findings of the SOLITUDE Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common intervention in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

BACKGROUND LVOT obstruction is a life-threatening complication of TMVR, caused by septal displacement of the AML. METHODS The procedure was used in patients with severe mitral valve disease and prohibitive surgical risk. Patients either had prior surgical mitral valve ring (n = 3) or band annuloplasty (n = 1) or mitral annular calcification with stenosis (n = 1). Iatrogenic LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction was predicted in all based on echocardiography and computed tomography. Transfemoral coronary guiding catheters directed an electrified guidewire across the center and base of the AML toward a snare in the left atrium. The externalized guidewire loop was then electrified to lacerate the AML along the centerline from base to tip, sparing chordae, immediately before transseptal TMVR. RESULTS Five patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction from TMVR successfully underwent LAMPOON, with longitudinal splitting of the A2 scallop of the AML, before valve implantation. Multiplane computed tomography modeling predicted hemodynamic collapse from TMVR assuming an intact AML. However, critical LVOT gradients were not seen following LAMPOON and TMVR. Doppler blood flow was seen across transcatheter heart valve struts that encroached the LVOT, because the AML was split. Transcatheter heart valve function was unimpeded. CONCLUSIONS This novel catheter technique, which resembles surgical chord-sparing AML resection, may enable TMVR in patients with prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve dysfunction.","output":"Intentional Percutaneous Laceration of the Anterior Mitral Leaflet to Prevent Outflow Obstruction During Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement: First-in-Human Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus spike protein S is assumed to mediate essential biological functions, including recognition of target cells. Earlier studies from our and other groups identified two regions of the TGEV S (220K) protein possibly implicated in such functions. The first of these corresponds to the 224 amino acid N-terminal region which is deleted in PRCV, the respiratory variant of TGEV. We have examined the pathogenicity for the newborn piglet of a series of neutralization escape mutants encoding an S protein mutated in this region. Several amino acid changes were correlated with a dramatic loss of enterovirulence, thus indicating that crucial determinants are associated with this domain of S. The second region of potential relevance is the major neutralization domain. Baculovirus-vectored expression of 150 to 220 amino acid-long stretches encompassing this region, which is encoded by both TGEV and PRCV, was performed. The resultant recombinant proteins were shown to react with the cognate antibodies and to bind APN specifically, thus localizing the receptor-binding site on the S primary structure. Altogether these data lend support to the view that a domain of S protein structurally distinct from the receptor binding site is required for the virus to express its enteric tropism.","output":"Functional domains in the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test kits are crucial for bridging diagnostic gaps in health facilities and community screening mainly in resource limited settings.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 clients between May and July 2020 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The performance of three SARS-CoV-2 rapid test kits EGENE, CTK BIOTECKs Onsite, and ACON Biotech were evaluated using blood specimens against RT-PCR on respiratory swabs. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement with each other and to RT-PCR were computed using Vassarstats, MedCalc and SPSS version 23 statistical software. RESULTS: Test kits showed a heterogeneous comparative diagnostic performance in their sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity was 61.18% (95% CI: 49.96C71.37%), 74.12% (95% CI: 63.28C82.74%) and 83.53% (95% CI: 73.57C90.38%) for kit A, B and C, respectively. Similarly, the specificity was 96.52% (90.81C98.88%), 94.78% (88.52C97.86%) and 94.78% (88.52C97.86%) for test kit A, B and C, respectively. The test kits have an agreement with RT-PCR with kappa value of 0.60 (0.48C0.83), 0.71 (0.65C0.93), and 0.80 (0.76C1.04) for A, B, and C, respectively. There was a significant difference on diagnostic performance among the three test kits and PCR with a p-value < 0.001 Cochrans Q test.

We investigate seroprevalence and evolution of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in relation to previous vaccination and/or exposure to COVID19 and ongoing IMID-treatment in a Belgian, reallife population of IMID patients. Methods: A cross-disciplinary, prospective, observational cohort study was set up at two university hospitals. All patients with IMIDs of the gut (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), joints (rheumatoid, psoriatic or spondyloarthritis) and skin (psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis) visiting the respective clinics were asked to participate. Patients had to fill out an electronic survey (REDCap?, based on WHO-ISARIC) and blood samples were drawn for serology testing (anti-Spike(S) and antiviral Nucleocapsid(N) protein antibody IgG, Abbott). Results at baseline, prior to the national vaccination program and at 6 months follow-up are presented. R version 4.0.2 was used for statistical analyses. Results: At baseline 2165 IMID patients consented to take part. In 3.2% SARS-CoV2 anti-N seroconversion was confirmed. Of the anti-N seroconverted patients 72.9% reported a positive PCR test prior to inclusion. At 6-months follow-up, data of 1853 IMID patients was collected. Of these, 81.7% were fully and 14.4% partially vaccinated. Seroconversion for anti-N antibodies was confirmed in 2.5% of all participants and seroconversion for anti-S antibodies in 90.8%. In 5.1% (61/1483) of fully vaccinated IMID patients no seroconversion in anti-N nor anti-S antibodies was found. Chi Square analyses show, at 6-months follow-up, no significant association between anti-S seroconversion rate and treatment with systemic steroids (RiskRatio 1.22, 95%CI 0.38-3.9, P=0.99), TIMT (RiskRatio 0.57, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P=0.12), IMM (RiskRatio 1.65, 95% CI 0.85- 3.19, P=0.19) or combination treatment IMM/TIMT (RiskRatio 1.60, 95% CI 0.75-3.4, P=0.32).

Conclusion: In this real-life IMID cohort, the number of COVID19 cases confirmed by PCR prior to vaccination was low. Seroconversion rate for anti-N antibodies was lower at 6-months follow-up, suggesting decrease in antibody titre over time. Full COVID19 vaccination led to a high anti-S antibody seroconversion rate. Nonetheless, 5.1% of fully vaccinated patients showed no antibody seroconversion.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well.

Subjects received 16 treatments (4 sessions/week) lasting 45 minutes. The primary outcome was voice intensity (dB) in monologue, vocalization, and sentences while voice handicap index (VHI) measured voice self-perception. Outcomes were assessed by a blinded observer at baseline, post-treatment, and 15-month follow-up (FU). RESULTS Linear models revealed a significant post-intervention between-group mean difference in favor of LSVT-LOUD for monologue: +6.3 dB (95% CI: 2.5 to 10.1); vocalization: +7.4 dB (95% CI: 2.3 to 12.5); and sentences: +9.5 dB (95% CI: 4.7 to 14.3). However, 43.7% PwMS in the LSVT-LOUD and 10% in the conventional treatment group obtained a full recovery of voice intensity (>60 dB) post-treatment, Fisher's test = 13.3, p < 0.01. However, these improvements were not maintained at FU. Between-group differences at VHI were -10.8 (95% CI: -21.2 to -0.4) and -11.3 (95% CI: -24.3 to -1.7) in favor of LSVT-LOUD at post and FU.

Our aim was to evaluate for the effect of prematurity-related morbidity on ANS development in preterm infants in the NICU. METHODS: We compared time and frequency domains of heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure of ANS tone in 56 preterm infants from 2 NICUs (28 from each). One cohort was from a high-morbidity regional referral NICU, the other from a community-based inborn NICU with low prematurity-related morbidity. Propensity score matching was used to balance the groups by a 1:1 nearest neighbor design. ANS tone was analyzed. RESULTS: The two cohorts showed parallel maturational trajectory of the alpha 1 time-domain metric, with the cohort from the high-morbidity NICU having lower autonomic tone. The maturational trajectories between the two cohorts differed in all other time-domain metrics (alpha 2, RMS1, RMS2). There was no difference between groups by frequency-domain metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity-associated morbidities correlate with autonomic development in premature infants and may have a greater impact on the extrauterine maturation of this system than birth gestational age. IMPACT: Autonomic nervous system development measured by time-domain metrics of heart rate variability correlate with morbidities associated with premature birth. This study builds upon our previously published work that showed that development of autonomic tone was not impacted by gestational age at birth.

A previous study showed that despite a plausible role for high-flow humidified nasal oxygen (HFNO) in this context, only 60% of participants achieved this target after t hree minutes of HFNO.1 This was vastly lower than reported rates with face mask (FM) oxygen. We conducted a randomised controlled crossover trial to determine if HFNO is non-inferior to FM oxygen for increasing etO2 concentration after simulated preoxygenation of women in late pregnancy (gestational age [Formula presented]6 weeks). Methods: After ethics approval, trial registration and consent, 70 women underwent simulated preoxygenation protocols with HFNO and FM oxygen sequentially. They were randomised to receive HFNO first then FM oxygen or vice versa. Baseline variables were measured before each protocol including etO2 concentration to ensure adequate oxygen washout between protocols. Protocols were three minutes long and conducted with the women in a ramped position and left lateral tilt. HFNO was delivered at highest tolerable flow rate with a maximum of 70 L/min and FM oxygen was delivered at 10 L/min. The primary outcome was first etO2 concentration after each protocol with a chosen non-inferiority margin of 5%. Recruitment occurred prior to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Results: 70 women were randomised. 62 women completed the study protocols without complications. Eight women were excluded due to technical faults or incomplete protocols. Participant characteristics were age (mean  SD, 34.7  4.6 years) and body mass index (BMI) (median (IQR), 28.5 (26.6C32.4 kg/m2). First etO2 concentration after HFNO protocol was non-inferior to first etO2 concentration after FM oxygen protocol (mean difference, 1.45;95% CI, 0.19C2.72;two-tailed [Formula presented]value, 0.025). 71% of participants achieved first etO2 concentration of [Formula presented]0% after the HFNO protocol versus 43.5% after the FM protocol. There was no evidence of correlation between first etO2 concentration after either modality and BMI or gestation. First etO2 concentration after HFNO was weakly correlated to percentage of time of mouth closure (Pearsons coefficient, 0.287). First etO2 concentration after FM oxygen was moderately correlated to respiratory rate in the final protocol minute and minute ventilation (Pearsons coefficient, 0.426 and 0.339 respectively).

Regression models estimated that early administration (5 days after admission) of IFN-2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality compared to no IFN-2b, while late administration of IFN-2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-2b was not associated with hospital discharge or CT scan improvement, while late IFN-2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-2b and umifenovir (UFV) alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone.

The intervention group (n = 55) will receive the ICollab intervention for 6 months post-discharge from the hospital, in addition to usual care. Children in the control group (n = 55) will receive only usual care. Outcome measures will include healthcare utilization metrics (hospitalization rates, emergency room visit rates, and days to readmission), caregiver burden and caregiver satisfaction with home healthcare, HHN retention, and HHN collaboration with other healthcare providers. We hypothesize that ICollab will reduce healthcare utilization and caregiver burden, and improve caregiver satisfaction with home healthcare, increase HHN retention, and increase HHN collaboration with other healthcare providers. Results of this study have the potential to provide a critically needed evidence-base for interventions to improve the quality of healthcare delivery for CMC.

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. METHODS: We used data from 46,284 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by other social or psychiatric factors. CONCLUSION: Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health.

METHODS Neural stem cells were isolated from rats and induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and recovery. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were applied to assess the function of ZGP on cell viability and apoptosis. Rat CI/R injury models were established by the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. The function of ZGP on CI/R injury was identified via evaluating modified neurological severity score, infarct area, and cognitive impairment. RESULTS Compared to the control, the cell viability was obviously decreased in the oxygen and glucose deprivation and recovery (OGD/R) group, while the adverse influence on cells was reversed by cultured plus 10% ZGP serum. Consistently, ZGP attenuated the influence of OGD/R on cell apoptosis. More importantly, ZGP could alleviate CI/R injury of rats by reducing neurological damage and infarct area and promoting cognitive function. CONCLUSION This study provided protective roles of ZGP on cell viability and apoptosis induced by OGD/R.

Cryo-EM structures of the WT and MT S-Trimers, determined at 3.2 ? and 2.6 ? respectively, revealed that both antigens adopt a tightly closed conformation and their structures are essentially identical to that of the previously solved full-length WT S protein in detergent. The tightly closed conformation is stabilized by fatty acid and polysorbate 80 binding at the receptor binding domains (RBDs) and the N terminal domains (NTDs) respectively. Additionally, we identified an important pH switch in the WT S-Trimer that shows dramatic conformational change and accounts for its increased stability at lower pH.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with left-sided abdominal pain radiating through to his back persisting for one day. He had COVID-19 PCR positivity nine days ago. After seven days of hospitalization due to COVID-19 pneumonia, he had been discharged with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) showed SI. His ECG and laboratory parameters were normal except for 17.2  103/L leukocytosis. The anticoagulant drug dose that he was taking was increased to 2  0.6 mL during hospitalization. He described new-onset chest pain during follow-up. Acute anterior MI was detected on ECG.

However, the number of patients with life threatening diseases other than COVID-19 like heart attacks or strokes has not changed at all. With a strong focus on COVID-19, there is a marked risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays or misdiagnoses, potentially harming those patients. In this respect, we present two of those cases with the intent to improve the medical management of traditional diseases in times of corona pandemia. METHODS: We present two patients with diseases others than SARS-CoV-2. Both cases were treated in our institution, a tertiary care hospital in the Southwest of Germany. RESULTS: One patient had a prolonged treatment on intensive care unit (ICU) because of heart failure following voluntary isolation because of fearing COVID-19 and subsequent shortage of medication. Another patient with hypothesis of COVID-19 of primary care physician because of fever and a history of skiing in a high risk region for SARS-CoV-2 was sent home for isolation. After disease progression, the patient presented in an external hospital with fever, pain in the right ear and tachypnea.

We infer X causes Y if the grammar inferred from X better compresses Y than in the other direction. To put this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions. We evaluate these models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with current state-of-the-art methods.

Methods: We conducted Nanopore metagenomic sequencing for 180 respiratory samples from a UK hospital during the 2018/19 influenza season, and compared results to routine molecular diagnostic testing. We investigated drug resistance, genetic diversity, and nosocomial transmission using influenza sequence data.

This cross-sectional study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh to observe the basic perception and attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) - doctors, interns, nurses, ward boys, cleaners, and medical technologists of major COVID-dedicated hospitals. The cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in February 2021 among 550 HCWs to assess the perception and attitude towards vaccination against COVID-19. The study participants were targeted as the priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, working in two major COVID-dedicated hospitals, Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital (HF-center), and Sheikh Russel National Gastro-liver Institute and Hospital (SR-center) in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the pandemic. The questionnaire was structured with a three-point scale of responses from 'true', 'false', and 'do not know'. The responses were calculated on point-score as +1 for the correct response, -1 for the wrong response, and 0 for 'do not know' with an overall highest and the lowest possible score of +5 to -5. Absolute (n) and relative frequencies (%) were presented for qualitative variables, while quantitative variables were presented as mean ( standard deviation). Chi-square test was done for univariate analysis of qualitative variables and Student's t-test for quantitative variables. With the 95.27% response rate, including 204 males and 320 were female and the male: female ratio was 1: 1.56. The majority of the participants were doctors (45.8%) followed by nurses (27.9%), and MLSS (26.3%) respectively. The respondents were between 18 to 64 years of age with a mean of 36.1710.94 years. Most of the respondents (95.99%) responded correctly about the cost-free availability of a vaccine against COVID-19 in the country, 87.40% preferred vaccination as safe and effective. Again 29.77% HCWs think the vaccine might not be safe or effective due to emergency authorization. Only 38.93% of respondents could respond correctly about the necessity of vaccines for children, 31.10% think the vaccination was not required instead of natural immunity. The positive perception and attitude of the frontline HCWs in COVID-dedicated hospitals in Bangladesh are crucial which will positively influence motivation and wide acceptance among the general population for the attainment of the nationwide vaccination program, and adopt effective strategic modification to minimize the gaps for a low-middle income country like Bangladesh with its resource constrain.","output":"Vaccination against COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Perception and Attitude of Healthcare Workers in COVID-dedicated Hospitals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After publication of the original article [1], an error was identified in two authors names.

Currently, a definitive diagnostic method for PA-induced liver injury (PA-ILI) is lacking. In the present study, using a newly developed analytical method, we identified four pyrrole-amino acid adducts (PAAAs), namely pyrrole-7-cysteine, pyrrole-9-cysteine, pyrrole-9-histidine, and pyrrole-7-acetylcysteine, which are generated from reactive pyrrolic metabolites of PAs, in the urine of PA-treated male Sprague Dawley rats and PA-ILI patients. The elimination profiles, abundance, and persistence of PAAAs were systematically investigated first in PA-treated rat models via oral administration of retrorsine at a single dose of 40 mg/kg and multiple doses of 5 mg/kg/day for 14 consecutive days, confirming that these urinary excreted PAAAs were derived specifically from PA exposure. Moreover, we determined that these PAAAs were detected in ~ 82% (129/158) of urine samples collected from ~ 91% (58/64) of PA-ILI patients with pyrrole-7-cysteine and pyrrole-9-histidine detectable in urine samples collected at 3 months or longer times after hospital admission, indicating adequate persistence time for use as a clinical test. As direct evidence of PA exposure, we propose that PAAAs can be used as a biomarker of PA exposure and the measurement of urinary PAAAs could be used as a non-invasive test assisting the definitive diagnosis of PA-ILI in patients.

Many estimates of human lung cancer risk from inhaled DE have been developed from rat bioassay data or from the comparative mutagenic potencies of DE soot extract and known human chemical carcinogens. To explore the importance of the DE soot-associated organic compounds in the lung tumor response of rats, male and female F344 rats were exposed chroni cally to diluted whole DE or aerosolized carbon black (CB) 16 hr/day, 5 days/week at target particle concentrations of 2.5 mg/m(3) (LDE, LCB) or 6.5 mg/m(3) (HDE, HCB) or to filtered air. The CB served as a surrogate for the elemental carbon matrix of DE soot. Considering both the mass fraction of solvent-extractable matter and its mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella assay, the mutagenicity in revertants per unit particle mass of the CB was three orders of magnitude less than that of the DE soot. Both DE soot and CB particles accumulated progressively in the lungs of exposed rats, but the rate of accumulation was higher for DE soot. In general, DE and CB caused similar, dose-related, nonneoplastic lesions. CB and DE caused significant, exposure concentration-related increases, of similar magnitudes, in the incidences and prevalences of the same types of malignant and benign lung neoplasms in female rats. The incidences of neoplasms were much lower in males than females, and the mci dences were slightly higher among DE- than CB-exposed males. Survival was shortened in the CB-exposed males, and the short ened survival may have suppressed the expression of carcinoge nicity as measured by crude incidence. Logistic regression mod eling did not demonstrate significant differences between the carcinogenic potencies of CB and DE in either gender. The re sults suggest that the organic fraction of DE may not play an important role in the carcinogenicity of DE in rats.","output":"Comparative Pulmonary Toxicities and Carcinogenicities of Chronically Inhaled Diesel Exhaust and Carban Black in F344 Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggest that the use of angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may upregulate angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 receptors and increase severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infectivity. We evaluated the association between ACEI or ARB use and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) infection among patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified patients with hypertension as of March 1, 2020 (index date) from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Patients who received ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics (TD), or no therapy were identified using outpatient pharmacy data covering the index date. Outcome of interest was a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for COVID\\\\19 between March 1 and May 6, 2020. Patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were identified within 1 year preindex date. Among 824 650 patients with hypertension, 16 898 (2.0%) were tested for COVID\\\\19. Of those tested, 1794 (10.6%) had a positive result. Overall, exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was not statistically significantly associated with COVID\\\\19 infection after propensity score adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90C1.25) for ACEIs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91C1.31 for ARBs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD).

Type of program or service: We present a case study of a participatory research collaboration between CALD community leaders and health behaviour change scientists during the COVID-19 crisis. The goal was to better understand the role of community leaders in shaping health behaviours in their communities and how that role might be leveraged for better health outcomes. METHODS: This article is the culmination of a series of dialogues between CALD community and advocacy leaders, and health behaviour change scientists in July 2020. The academic authors recruited 12 prominent CALD community leaders, conducted five semi-structured dialogues with small groups, and worked with all participants to develop insights that were applicable to the many different CALD communities represented in the research collaboration. RESULTS: Three key findings emerged: 1) partnerships between CALD leaders, communities and government are critical for effective health communication; 2) shifting behaviour requires moving beyond disseminating information to designing tailored solutions; and 3) the diverse needs and circumstances of people and communities must be at the centre of health communication and behaviour change strategies. LESSONS LEARNT: The collaborative process we undertook in this study enabled us to identify key challenges experienced and solutions offered by CALD leaders in communicating health information throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with communities that are subject to health messaging can reduce inequalities in healthcare communication by enabling the development of strategies that help align human behaviour with the recommendations of health experts. This - along with sustained partnership and collaboration with CALD communities, understanding the cultural context, and the appropriate tailoring and delivery of communications - will ensure health-related messages are not lost in translation. The lessons provided in this paper are applicable not only to the current pandemic but also to post-pandemic social and economic recovery.","output":"Communicating COVID-19 health information to culturally and linguistically diverse communities: insights from a participatory research collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the biggest challenges in the field of healthcare Nanomedicine is a developing area that has the potential to treat various diseases and control infections Now, its applications are open for the treatment of COVID-19 We have studied relevant papers through Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct and ResearchGate on nanomedicine in context of COVID-19 This paper provides detailed information about nanomedicine in the context of healthcare It further identifies the primary challenges faced in the current situation This study provides details about the advancements in the area of nanomedicine in healthcare for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic Finally, we have identified and discussed various significant applications of nanomedicine in solving challenges thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic Researchers can work on developing applications of nanoparticles with the size of the novel Coronavirus Nanomedicine is helpful to repair the cells of an infected patient the help of repair proteins It also plays a vital role in testing medicine and helps many clinical trials get approval from healthcare agencies In the future, nanomedicine will be helpful for fighting against this pandemic and creating advancements in healthcare","output":"Nanomedicine Technology and COVID-19 Outbreak: Applications and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China has stepped into an era of aging society, where the impending considerable economic burden attributed to high prevalence of dementia in the elderly appears to be one of the most important health and social issues to deal with for the country. However, population-based quantification and projections for the economic burden of dementia in China are lacking for further health action and policy making. OBJECTIVE: To estimate and predict the costs of managing dementia in the elderly population aged 60 and above from 2010 to 2050 in China. METHODS: Data were collected from a six-province study (n = 7072) and other multiple sources for calculation of the economic burden of dementia. With the convincing data from published studies, we quantified and projected the costs attributed to dementia in China from 2010 to 2050. RESULTS: The national cost of dementia in 2010 was estimated to be US$22.8 billion by the opportunity cost method and US$26.4 billion by the proxy method. In 2050, the costs would increase to US$372.3 billion by the opportunity cost method and US$430.6 billion by the proxy method, consuming 0.53% and 0.61% of Chinas total GDP, respectively. A series of sensitivity analyses showed that the changes in the proportions of informal caregiving led to the most robust changes in the total burden of care for dementia in China. CONCLUSION: Dementia represents an enormous burden on Chinas population health and economy.

We aimed to determine whether colchicine is effective at reducing time to recovery and COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths among people in the community. Design: Prospective, multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive Platform Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE). Setting: National trial run remotely from a central trial site and at multiple primary care centres across the United Kingdom. Participants: Adults aged []65, or []18 years with comorbidities or shortness of breath, and unwell []14 days with suspected COVID-19 in the community. Interventions: Participants were randomised to usual care, usual care plus colchicine (500g daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions. Main outcome measures: The co-primary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation/death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. The hypothesis for the time to recovery endpoint is evaluated first, and if superiority is declared on time to recovery, the hypothesis for the second co-primary endpoint of hospitalisation/death is then evaluated. To determine futility, we pre-specified a clinically meaningful benefit in time to first reported recovery as a hazard ratio of 1.2 or larger (equating to approximately 1.5 days benefit in the colchicine arm, assuming 9 days recovery in the usual care arm). Results: The trial opened on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to colchicine starting on March 04, 2021 and stopping on May 26, 2021, because the pre-specified time to recovery futility criterion was met. The primary analysis model included 2755 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, randomised to colchicine (n=156), usual care (n=1145), and other treatments (n=1454). Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.919 [95% credible interval 0.72 to 1.16] and an estimated increase of 1.14 days [-1.86 to 5.21] in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. Results were similar in comparisons with concurrent controls. COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 [0.28 to 1.89] and an estimated difference of -0.4% [-2.7% to 2.4].

Knowledge of the concept of developmental hemostasis is an essential prerequisite for the proper interpretation of conventional coagulation tests (CCT) and is critical to ensure the optimal diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhagic and thrombotic diseases in neonatal age. Viscoelastic tests (VETs) provide a point-of-care, real-time, global, and dynamic assessment of the mechanical properties of the coagulation system with the examination of both cellular and plasma protein contributions to the initiation, formation, and lysis of clots. In this work, we provide a narrative review of the basic principles of VETs and summarize current evidence regarding the two most studied point-of-care VETs, thromboelastography (TEG(?)) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM(?)), in the field of neonatal care. A literature analysis shows that viscoelastic hemostatic monitoring appears to be a useful additive technique to CCT, allowing targeted therapy to be delivered quickly. These tools may allow researchers to determine the neonatal coagulation profile and detect neonatal patients at risk for postoperative bleeding, coagulation abnormalities in neonatal sepsis, and other bleeding events in a timely manner, guiding transfusion therapies using the goal-oriented transfusion algorithm. However, diagnosis and treatment algorithms incorporating VETs for neonatal patients in a variety of clinical situations should be developed and applied to improve clinical outcomes.

The diagnosis is based on the clinical history and, if needed in patients with uncontrolled rhinitis despite medications or with long-lasting symptoms, on skin tests or the presence of serum-specific IgE antibodies to allergens. The most frequently used pharmacological treatments include oral, intranasal or ocular H1-antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids or a fixed combination of intranasal H1-antihistamines and corticosteroids. Allergen immunotherapy prescribed by a specialist using high-quality extracts in stratified patients is effective in patients with persistent symptoms. Real-world data obtained by mobile technology offer new insights into AR phenotypes and management. The outlook for AR includes a better understanding of novel multimorbid phenotypes, health technology assessment and patient-centred shared decision-making.","output":"Allergic rhinitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: In 2014, in response to evidence that Canadas tobacco use would lead, inexorably, to substantial morbidity and mortality for the foreseeable future, a group of experts convened to consider the development of a Tobacco Endgame for Canada. The Tobacco Endgame defines a time frame in which to eliminate structural, political, and social dynamics that sustain tobacco use, leading to improved population health. Strategies: A series of Background Papers describing possible measures that could contribute to the creation of a comprehensive endgame strategy for Canada was prepared in advance of the National Tobacco Endgame Summit hosted at Queens University in 2016. At the summit, agreement was reached to work together to achieve <5% tobacco use by 2035 (<5 by 35). A report of the proceedings was shared widely. Achievements: Progress since 2016 has been mixed. The Summit report was followed by a national forum convened by Health Canada in March 2017, and in 2018, the Canadian Government adopted <5  35 tobacco use target in a renewed Canadian tobacco reduction strategy. Tobacco use has declined in the last 5 years, but at a rate slower than that which will be needed to achieve the <5 by 35 goal. There remain > 5 million smokers in Canada, signaling that smoking-related diseases will continue to be an enormous health burden. Furthermore, the landscape of new products (e-cigarettes and cannabis) has created additional risks and opportunities. Future directions: A bold, reinvigorated tobacco control strategy is needed that significantly advances ongoing policy developments, including full implementation of the key demand-reduction policies of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

We report a case of an adult male with multiple risk factors, who presented with severe abdominal pain and tenderness in the right inguinal fossa. He was evaluated for differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, renal colic, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and COVID-19. His investigations showed normal laboratory tests and a normal chest radiograph. His CT abdomen showed a normal appendix and multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes. His COVID-19 PCR was positive.

This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS- CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinskis rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinskis rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox ? 7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin ? 8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid ? 8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin ? 8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp.

Hendra and Nipah virus are members of a newly identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, Henipavirus. Since their discovery in the 1990s, henipaviruses outbreaks have been associated with high economic and public health threat potential. When compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique characteristics. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a broader tropism than most other paramyxoviruses, and can cause severe acute encephalitis with unique features among viral encephalitides. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infections. Although ribavirin was empirically used and seemed beneficial during the biggest outbreak caused by one of these viruses, the Nipah virus, its efficacy is disputed in light of its lack of efficacy in several animal models of henipavirus infection. Nevertheless, because of its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been spent in developing anti-henipavirus therapeutics. In this review we describe the unique features of henipavirus infections and the different strategies and animal models that have been developed so far in order to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these components have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals as they target effectors of viral pathogenecity common to other viruses.

In this paper, an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed in a smart hospital IoT system for detecting events of interest about patients health and environment and, at the same time, for network intrusions. Providing a single system for network infrastructure supervision and e-health monitoring has been shown to optimize resources and enforce the system reliability. Consequently, decisions regarding patients care and their environments adaptation are more accurate. The low latency is ensured, thanks to a deployment on the edge to allow for a processing close to data sources. The proposed ADS is implemented and evaluated while using Contiki Cooja simulator and the e-health event detection is based on a realistic data-set analysis.

Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages & Disadvantages (4) Students Preference. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science & Technology via their e-learning accounts (n = 3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. RESULTS: 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4%) used live classes, and 22.8% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7%) and (57%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p < .001). With reference to students preferences 75% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. CONCLUSION: Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system.

This helps to identify the ways that human responses to change relate to changing water resources and identifies important thresholds and potential disconnects that would create vulnerability. We further use this tool to describe a dynamic, coupled human-water system present in the arid Sierra de la Giganta region of Baja California Sur, Mexico.

We found that TNPO3-deficient cells inhibited infection with four different IAV strains, whereas restoration of TNPO3 expression in knockout (KO) cells restored IAV infection. TNPO3 overexpression in wild-type (WT) cells promoted IAV infection, suggesting that TNPO3 is involved in the IAV replication. Furthermore, we found that TNPO3 depletion restrained the uncoating in the IAV life cycle, thereby inhibiting the process of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) entry into the nucleus. However, KO of TNPO3 did not affect the virus attachment, endocytosis, or endosomal acidification processes. Subsequently, we found that TNPO3 can colocalize and interact with viral proteins M1 and M2. Taken together, the depletion of TNPO3 inhibits IAV uncoating, thereby inhibiting IAV replication.

At the same time, peptides and other biomolecules are industrially synthesized through techniques (e.g., solid-phase synthesis) often leading to the formation of many impurities with molecular characteristics very similar to the target product. Therefore, the purification of these mixtures via preparative chromatography can be very challenging. This typically involves ternary or central-cut separations, characterized by chromatograms where the central peak, corresponding to the target product, exhibits significant overlapping on both sides with impurities slightly more or less adsorbable. In single-column (batch) preparative chromatography, this leads to a typical yield-purity tradeoff, meaning that high purity can be obtained at the cost of low yield and vice versa, with obvious consequences on the overall production costs. This study demonstrates how this limitation can be alleviated using the continuous countercurrent operating mode, conducted on a multicolumn system, as a tool for process intensification. In particular, the Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) process has been applied to the purification of an industrial crude mixture of icatibant, which is a peptidomimetic antagonist of bradykinin B2-receptor that has been recently also considered for the treatment of patients affected by COVID-19 disease.

Establishing a standardized FUO emergency department within a short period of time has become the key to preventing and controlling COVID-19 in densely populated Chinese cities. Methods Based on the lean management model, the research group established a process of less-link visits, which sees reduced contact between patients and physicians during diagnosis and treatment, and zero-contact consultation through lean workflow and value stream analysis. Three steps were implemented to improve the operations of the FUO emergency department: the rapid establishment of an isolation zone, the refinement of duty and protection configuration, and the use of Internet and technology to establish a full-process follow-up consultation system. Results (I) Tests related to COVID-19 screening are all completed in the FUO emergency department; (II) 12 new isolated observation rooms have been built; (III) hospital visiting time, waiting time for consultation, and the time from pre-examination to virus screening has been shortened from 18 to 8 hours, from 2 hours to 10 minutes, and from 34 to 3 hours, respectively; (IV) the transfer distance has been shortened from 450 to 20 m, and the observation time has been shortened from 72 to 26 hours. The median waiting time for image examination has been reduced from 40 to 3 minutes, and the moving distance has been shortened from 800 to 10 m; (V) the diagnosis and treatment process is facilitated by 5G, achieving zero contact between doctors and patients. Conclusions Through the implantation of information technology, the local transformation of the site, the rational allocation of medical teams and the planned distribution of protective equipment, in a short period of time, individual medical institutions can set up a safe FUO emergency department to provide 24-hour screening and detention services.

Based on stochastic optimization, the model determines efficient strategies on the basis of commuting of individuals and the situation of hospitals in each district. Uncertainty in the capacity of intensive care beds is handled by a chance-constraint approach.

The current study offers a unique contribution by taking an inductive approach, giving participants voice to describe their own work ability experiences. Participants (N = 301) who were working at least 30 h a week in the U.S. and reported one or more hindrances to work ability responded to four open-ended questions about hindrances to work ability, individual strategies for maintaining work ability, and employer supports for maintaining work ability. Using constant comparative analysis, we corroborated existing work ability research and theory, along with unique contributions that enhance our understanding of perceived work ability. Notably, non-work demands, such as family obligations and lack of financial resources are under-examined, yet emerged as important work ability hindrances in this study. We also uncovered several personal strategies to help maintain WA (e.g., maintaining health and using work strategies to optimize functionality) that are dependent upon available job resources (e.g., support, autonomy, and flexibility). Ultimately, job resources of support, job control, and flexibility emerged as the most powerful leverage points for organizations to help workers maintain WA.

To gain insight into OtI mmWave scenarios at 28 GHz, we conducted an extensive measurement campaign consisting of over 2,200 link measurements. In total, 43 OtI scenarios were measured in West Harlem, New York City, covering seven highly diverse buildings. The measured OtI path gain can vary by up to 40 dB for a given link distance, and the empirical path gain model for all data shows an average of 30 dB excess loss over free space at distances beyond 50 m, with an RMS fitting error of 11.7 dB. The type of glass is found to be the single dominant feature for OtI loss, with 20 dB observed difference between empirical path gain models for scenarios with low-loss and high-loss glass. The presence of scaffolding, tree foliage, or elevated subway tracks, as well as difference in floor height are each found to have an impact between 5-10 dB. We show that for urban buildings with high-loss glass, OtI coverage can support 500 Mbps for 90% of indoor user equipment (UEs) with a base station (BS) antenna placed up to 49 m away. For buildings with low-loss glass, such as our case study covering multiple classrooms of a public school, data rates over 2.5/1.2 Gbps are possible from a BS 68/175 m away from the school building, when a line-of-sight path is available. We expect these results to be useful for the deployment of mmWave networks in dense urban environments as well as the development of relevant scheduling and beam management algorithms.","output":"Outdoor-to-Indoor 28 GHz Wireless Measurements in Manhattan: Path Loss, Environmental Effects, and 90% Coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a pandemic since March 11, 2020 and caused devastating effects with high death rates worldwide.

To begin to explore the underlying mechanism(s) of this viral effect, we sought in the present study to: (1) determine whether SDAV invades and replicates in lacrimal gland acinar cells in vitro and (2) assess whether short-term SDAV challenge interferes with the viability or function of acinar cells in vitro. For comparison we also evaluated the relative infectivity of SDAV in acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal, submandibular and parotid glands, given that salivary tissues are known to be highly susceptible to SDAV infection in vivo. Acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal, submandibular or parotid glands were isolated from male rats, exposed briefly to SDAV or control cell antigen and then cultured for four, eight or twelve days. At experimental termination, SDAV titers in both media and sonicated cell extracts were evaluated by plaque assay titration on mouse L2 cell monolayers. To evaluate functional aspects of lacrimal gland acinar cells, SDAV-infected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone and culture media were analyzed by RIA to measure the extent of the androgen-induced increase in secretory component (SC) production. Our results showed that: (1) SDAV invades and replicates in lacrimal gland acinar cells, Viral challenge resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase in SDAV titers, that were primarily cell-associated and greatly exceeded amounts contained in the original inoculum; (2) SDAV infection did not compromise lacrimal acinar cell viability or prevent the cellular SC response to androgens. Viral presence, though, did often attenuate the magnitude of this hormone action; and (3) SDAV infects salivary acinar cells, but the kinetics and magnitude or viral replication in lacrimal, submandibular and parotid cells showed considerable variations. These findings demonstrate that SDAV invades and replicates in acinar epithelial cells from lacrimal and salivary glands.

The early days of the pandemic with an almost complete lockdown had a huge impact in the restaurant sector as all restaurants were suddenly forced to close. That lead to a vast majority of restaurants reinforcing their already existing take-away and delivery operations or starting to operate that way. In order to better understand the relationship between consumers and take-away and delivery services provided by restaurants, a research was conducted to assess the degree of use of these services. The research took place between the 9th and the 25th of April by means of an online survey resulting in 448 valid responses. The majority of the responders (69%) already used these services prior to Covid-19 between 1 and 3 times a week. On the other side, 28% said that they had never used take-away or delivery. During the pandemic, 53% claimed not to use take away and delivery services whilst only 45% said they were using it 1 to 3 times a week. When questioned about their future intents after the pandemic, 72% predicted they will use take-away 1 to 3 times a week. Within the consumers that use take-away and delivery, 22.5% spend less than 10 per order, 54% from 10 to 20 and 23.5% spend more than 20. Preliminary results show that despite the fact these services were already being used prior to Covid-19, frequency of usage is on the rise, foreseeing significant growth for take-away and delivery in the near future. Data also seems to indicate that this phenomenon is not specific of big cities and urban population and could become an overall trend.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of 204 consecutive patients with giant intracranial aneurysms who underwent surgical treatment in our department from 1995 to 2008. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS Surgical modalities included direct aneurysm neck clipping in 102 patients (50.0%), parent artery reconstruction in 51 patients (25.0%), proximal artery ligation in 23 patients (11.3%; 4 patients combined with revascularization), trapping in 26 patients (12.7%), and wrapping in 2 patients (1.0%). Follow-up data were available for 181 patients (88.7%), with a mean follow-up period of 62 months (range, 12-164 months). A good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 5) was observed in 114 patients (63.0%), and a poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-4) was observed in 67 patients (37.0%). Independent factors that affected prognosis were age and location of aneurysm. Older age (50 years) and location of aneurysm in posterior circulation were associated with poor outcome.

The outbreak has posed a huge challenge to countries around the world and has resulted in a global lockdown. The pandemic has especially overburdened the healthcare sector, resulting in a shortage of personnel and equipment. Along with many other manifestations, it has resulted in stress and anxiety for the physicians as well. Furthermore, many healthcare workers have been reluctant in treating COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to explore the concerns of physicians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the reasons for their reluctance to treat the patients. Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study included 235 physicians from seven hospitals of Pakistan who were actively working amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020, using a structured online questionnaire. Participants were approached via non-probability convenient sampling. Two hundred and eight respondents were included in the data analysis. SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data entry and analysis. Results A striking 83.7% (n=174) of the respondents expressed their reluctance to treat patients with COVID-19. Concerns they raised included one or more of the following four reasons; lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of self-infection, excessive workload, and fear of transmitting the infection to their family members. Of note, 92% (n=161) of the respondents reported a lack of PPE while 74.1% (n=129) reported fear of transmitting the infection to their family members as reasons for their reluctance. The vast majority of the participants reported the need for psychological training to treat the patients' anxiety (95.2%, n=198). Many participants were afraid that their own anxiety might be affecting the quality of care patients were receiving (67.3%, n=140). Hence, most of the participants reported that psychological counseling should be provided (93.3%, n=194). Participants with family members older than 60 years were found to be reluctant to treat patients due to the risk of transmitting the infection to them (69.7%, n=145, p=0.001). Therefore, a major proportion of the participants (96.2%, n=200) felt that the hospitals should provide a place for them to rest and temporarily isolate themselves to avoid coming into contact with their family members. Conclusions We conclude that a major proportion of physicians is reluctant to treat their patients due to multiple factors. The grave situation of the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health, which could be affecting the quality of care that the patients receive.

This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS: Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1).

Here we aimed to identify ILCs subsets in the human thymus and provide insight into the possible modulatory effect of purified IgG on these cells. Thymic tissues were obtained from 12 infants without an allergic background (non-atopic), and a literature-based peripheral ILCs staining protocol was used. Purified IgG was obtained from non-atopic individuals (n-At), atopic individuals reactive to allergens non-related to dust mites (nr-At), and atopic individuals reactive to the mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Derp-At). As with all tissues in which they have already been detected, thymic ILCs are rare, but we could detect viable ILCs in all tested tissues, which did not occur with the ILC1 subset. ILC2 and ILC3 NKp44+ subsets could be detected in all evaluated thymus, but ILC3 NKp44- subset could not. Next, we observed that Derp-At IgG could induce the expression of ILC2 phenotype, higher levels of IL-13, and lower levels of IL-4 when compared to IgG purified from non-atopic or non-related atopic (atopic to allergens excluding dust mites) individuals.

The main assays focus on the parallel detection of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against the spike trimer, its receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N). We automated a surrogate neutralisation (sn)ELISA that measures inhibition of ACE2\\\\spike or \\\\RBD interactions by antibodies. The assays were calibrated to a World Health Organization reference standard. RESULTS: Our single\\\\point IgG\\\\based ELISAs accurately distinguished non\\\\infected and infected individuals. For seroprevalence assessment (in a non\\\\vaccinated cohort), classifying a sample as positive if antibodies were detected for  2 of the 3 antigens provided the highest specificity. In vaccinated cohorts, increases in anti\\\\spike and \\\\RBD (but not \\\\N) antibodies are observed. We present detailed protocols for serum/plasma or dried blood spots analysis performed manually and on automated platforms. The snELISA can be performed automatically at single points, increasing its scalability. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring antibodies to three viral antigens and identify neutralising antibodies capable of disrupting spike\\\\ACE2 interactions in high\\\\throughput enables large\\\\scale analyses of humoral immune responses to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and vaccination. The reagents are available to enable scaling up of standardised serological assays, permitting inter\\\\laboratory data comparison and aggregation.","output":"A scalable serology solution for profiling humoral immune responses to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-involving responses are direct expressions of genetic counselors' here-and-now feelings about/reactions to patients. Strategic, sparing use of self-involving responses may enhance practitioner genuineness, likeability, and trustworthiness, decrease patient anxiety, and increase patient trust and engagement. Conversely, they may threaten patients who are uncomfortable with emotional expression or confuse them about the counselor's intentions. Despite theorized benefits and risks, no study has explored genetic counselor self-involving responses. This study explored whether clinical genetic counselors use self-involving responses with their patients, reasons for doing so, and their perceptions of when and why the responses work well versus poorly. Two-hundred sixty-eight genetic counselors, invited via a National Society of Genetic Counselors e-blast, completed an online screening survey. Eighty-nine percent reported using self-involving responses with patients, and 17 were purposively selected to participate in semi-structured phone interviews. Thematic analysis yielded themes regarding potential benefits, risks, counselor factors and context, and patient factors related to using self-involving responses. Benefits include conveying counselor conditions for facilitating counseling process (e.g., genuineness, building rapport, focusing the session, and encouraging the patient to open-up), and counseling outcomes by validating decision-making. Risks of use include hindering counseling processes and outcomes by misperceiving patient feelings, boundary crossing, and being unduly directive. Factors, both from the counselor and the context of the session, include comfort with the technique, mastery of clinical skills, minimal knowledge of patient emotions, type of counseling session, and counselor practice specialty. Patient factors include prior rapport with the counselor, and patient emotionality and cultural background. Findings underscore the need for training about this technique. Future research could examine patients' perceptions of self-involving statements and differences in self-involvement across practice specialties and counseling modalities.","output":"Genetic counselor use of self-involving responses in a clinical setting: A qualitative investigation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is one of the most devastating in this century.

Due to its ability to regulate cell homeostasis, H2 therapy has exhibited marked therapeutic effects on a number of oxidative stress-associated diseases. The present study investigated the effectiveness of H2 therapy in protecting against myocardial injury in a rat model of asphyxial cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Rats underwent 10-min asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and were randomly divided into control and H2 therapy groups. After resuscitation, the H2 therapy group was administered room air mixed with 2% H2 gas for respiration. During CA/CPR, the arterial pressure and heart rate were measured every minute. Survival rate, cardiac function, myocardial injury biomarkers creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin-T, and histopathological changes were evaluated to determine the protective effects of H2 therapy in CA/CPR. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to determine the expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins. In vitro, H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and H2-rich medium was used in H2 treatment groups. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to observe the expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins. Moreover, an adenovirus-monomeric red fluorescent protein-green fluorescent protein-LC3 construct was used to explore the dynamics of autophagy in the H9C2 cells. The results showed that H2 therapy significantly improved post-resuscitation survival and cardiac function. H2 therapy also improved mitochondrial mass and decreased autophagosome numbers in cardiomyocytes after resuscitation. The treatment inhibited autophagy activation, with lower expression levels of autophagy-associated proteins and decreased autophagosome formation in vivo and vitro.

The novelty in this work is two-fold. First, the population is divided according to its compliance with disease control directives (lockdown, shelter-in-place, masks/face coverings, physical distancing, etc.) into those who fully comply and those who follow the directives partially, or are necessarily mobile (such as medical staff). This split, indirectly, reflects on the quality and consistency of these measures. This allows the assessment of the overall effectiveness of the control measures and the impact of their relaxing or tightening on the disease spread. Second, the adequate contact rate, which directly affects the infection rate, is one of the model unknowns, as it keeps track of the changes in the population behavior and the effectiveness of various disease treatment modalities via a differential inclusion. Existence, uniqueness and positivity results are proved using a nonstandard convex analysis-based approach. As a case study, the pandemic outbreak in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) is simulated. The model parameters were found by minimizing the deviation of the model prediction from the reported data over the first 100 days of the pandemic in South Korea.The simulations show that the model captures accurately the pandemic dynamics in the subsequent 75 days, which provides confidence in the model predictions and its future use. In particular, the model predicts that about 40% of the infections were not documented, which implies that asymptomatic infections contribute silently but substantially to the spread of the disease indicating that more widespread asymptomatic testing is necessary.","output":"A mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics with dependent variable infection rate: Application to the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions.

However, direct comparisons of their utility in COVID-19 versus other respiratory infections are largely missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the prognostic utility of various inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 compared to patients with other respiratory infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. Levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, and leukocytes were compared between COVID-19, other viral respiratory infections, and bacterial pneumonia. Primary outcome was the need for hospitalisation, secondary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death at 30 days. RESULTS: Among 514 patients with confirmed respiratory infections, 191 (37%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, 227 (44%) with another viral respiratory infection (viral controls), and 96 (19%) with bacterial pneumonia (bacterial controls). All inflammatory biomarkers differed significantly between diagnoses and were numerically higher in hospitalized patients, regardless of diagnoses. Discriminative accuracy for hospitalisation was highest for IL-6 and CRP in all three diagnoses (in COVID-19, area under the curve (AUC) for IL-6 0.899 [95%CI 0.850C0.948]; AUC for CRP 0.922 [95%CI 0.879C0.964]). Similarly, IL-6 and CRP ranged among the strongest predictors for ICU admission or death at 30 days in COVID-19 (AUC for IL-6 0.794 [95%CI 0.694C0.894]; AUC for CRP 0.807 [95%CI 0.721C0.893]) and both controls. Predictive values of inflammatory biomarkers were generally higher in COVID-19 than in controls. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, inflammatory biomarkers harbour strong prognostic information, particularly IL-6 and CRP.

But how would the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic curve have changed had these same dollars been allocated to proven preventive interventions? METHODS: Performance and activity metrics on all COVID-19 related TV ads that have aired in the U.S. between February 26(th) and June 7(th), 2020, were provided by iSpot.tv, Inc., including expenditures. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Descriptive statistics were performed to calculate total TV ad expenditures and other performance metrics across industry categories. Leveraging a previously published stochastic agent-based model that was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19, the number of cases that would have been prevented had these same dollars been used for preventive interventions was calculated using cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), the cost divided by cases prevented. RESULTS: A total of 1,513 companies purchased TV airtime during the study period, totaling approximately 1.1 million airings, 215.5 billion impressions, and $2.7 billion in expenditures; most of the expenditures were spent by the restaurant (15.9%), electronics and communications (15.4%), and vehicle (13.7%) industries. The CERs for PPE and social distancing measures were $13,856 and $29,552, respectively; therefore, had all of these TV ad dollars instead been allocated to PPE or social distancing measures, approximately 194,908 and 91,386 cases of COVID-19 may have been prevented by the end of the study period, respectively.

RESULTS We have treated 11 patients successfully with the Contour device to date. All patients were women with a mean (SD) age of 65.0 (6.4) years. In total, four basilar tip, two internal carotid artery, three middle cerebral artery, one anterior communicating artery, and one superior cerebellar artery aneurysms were treated. At 1-year follow-up, complete occlusion (Raymond Class 1) was seen in 55.56% (5/9) of cases, with 44.44% (4/9) having small neck remnants (Raymond Class 2). One patient declined 1-year catheter angiography and another had no further follow-up due to an unrelated medical condition. For six patients, 2-year radiological follow-up is available and shows stability. At 6 weeks, nine of the 11 patients had a modifed Rankin Scale score of 0, with two patients scoring 1 for headaches. Two patients had thromboembolic events, but there were no complications leading to permanent neurological disability or death.

Through this analysis, we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can significantly reduce the attack rate in schools, contrary to a reactive screening approach.

Viruses, as a member of microbial contaminants, seriously threaten human health due to their high environmental resistance, having small sizes, and causing an extensive range of diseases. Therefore, selecting an appropriate technology to remove viral contaminants from the air, water, and foods is of prominent significance. Traditional methods for viral disinfection have not proven to be highly practical and effective because they need high energy resources and operational expenses. In recent years, semiconductor-based photocatalysis has attracted more attention in the field of microorganism inactivation due to its outstanding performance and mild reaction conditions. Therefore, this review primarily concentrates on the recent development in viral inactivation/disinfection by heterogeneous photocatalysts. Moreover, the photocatalytic viral inactivation of waterborne, airborne, and foodborne viruses is discussed. Given the appealing merits of heterogeneous photocatalytic disinfection of viruses, there is no doubt that this technology will be an impressively active research field and a source of comfort and confidence to humans in battling against viruses.","output":"Review on heterogeneous photocatalytic disinfection of waterborne, airborne, and foodborne viruses: Can we win against pathogenic viruses?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal origin food products, including fish and seafood, meat and poultry, milk and dairy foods, and other related products play significant roles in human nutrition. However, fraud in this food sector frequently occurs, leading to negative economic impacts on consumers and potential risks to public health and the environment. Therefore, the development of analytical techniques that can rapidly detect fraud and verify the authenticity of such products is of paramount importance. Traditionally, a wide variety of targeted approaches, such as chemical, chromatographic, molecular, and protein-based techniques, among others, have been frequently used to identify animal species, production methods, provenance, and processing of food products. Although these conventional methods are accurate and reliable, they are destructive, time-consuming, and can only be employed at the laboratory scale. On the contrary, alternative methods based mainly on spectroscopy have emerged in recent years as invaluable tools to overcome most of the limitations associated with traditional measurements. The number of scientific studies reporting on various authenticity issues investigated by vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy has increased substantially over the past few years, indicating the tremendous potential of these techniques in the fight against food fraud. It is the aim of the present manuscript to review the state-of-the-art research advances since 2015 regarding the use of analytical methods applied to detect fraud in food products of animal origin, with particular attention paid to spectroscopic measurements coupled with chemometric analysis. The opportunities and challenges surrounding the use of spectroscopic techniques and possible future directions will also be discussed.","output":"Fraud in Animal Origin Food Products: Advances in Emerging Spectroscopic Detection Methods over the Past Five Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread worldwide via international travel. This study traced its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few superspreaders that played a central role in the transmission of this disease in India. DATA AND METHODS: We used the travel history of infected patients from January 30 to April 6, 2020, as the primary data source. A total of 1386 cases were assessed, of which 373 were international, and 1013 were national contacts. The networks were generated in Gephi software (version 0.9.2). RESULTS: The maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (degree 144) and the UK (degree 64). Dubais eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India. Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14, 2020. This was primarily attributed to a gathering at the Delhi Religious Conference (DRC) known as Tabliqui Jamaat. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to International travels with the very first patient travelling from Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the contacts of positive cases were located, and a significant spread was identified in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka. The COVID-19s spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local.","output":"Tracking the spread of COVID-19 in India via social networks in the early phase of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Both the COVID-19 pandemic and its management have had a negative impact on mental health worldwide. There is a growing body of research on mental health as it relates to the pandemic. The objective of this study is to use bibliometric analyses to assess the mental health research output related to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to that of the West Africa Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks. METHODOLOGY: We performed comprehensive searches in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases, and included all types of documents related to the three outbreaks published since the respective beginnings up to August 26, 2020. RESULTS: Despite the shorter time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to Ebola and H1N1, we found a much greater number of mental health documents related to COVID-19 (n=3,070) compared to the two other outbreaks (127 for Ebola and 327 for H1N1). The proportion of documents in the top 10% journals was 31% for COVID-19, 24% for Ebola, and 40% for H1N1. Authors affiliated with institutions located in high-income countries published or contributed to 79% of all documents followed by authors from upper-middle-income countries (23%), lower-middle-income countries (10%), and low-income countries (2%). Approximately 19% of the documents reported receiving funding and 23% were the product of international collaboration. CONCLUSION: Mental health research output is already greater for COVID-19 compared to Ebola and H1N1 combined.

The systematic study of these two features of social systems has started only very recently, mainly thanks to the development of multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic models unfolding at comparable timescale with respect to the evolution of the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic threshold as a function of the multiplexity and the features of each layer. We found that higher values of multiplexity significantly reduce the epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of nodes present on multiple layers are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics is driven by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the multiplexity. However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics is sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their effects on contagion phenomena.","output":"Epidemic spreading on time-varying multiplex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell entry, the fundamental step in cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), is initiated by the recognition of the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. To date, several peptides have been proposed against SARS-CoV-2 both as inhibitor agents or as detection tools that can also be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers. But owing to their natural amino acid sequences, such peptides cannot be considered as efficient therapeutic candidates from a biostability point of view.

Paone et al. were among the first scientists to use the term biomarker in the course of a comparative study dealing with breast carcinoma [REF2]. In recent years, in addition to proteins and genes, miRNA or micro RNAs, which play an essential role in gene expression, have gained increased interest as valuable biomarkers. As a result, more and more information on miRNA biomarkers can be extracted via text mining approaches from the increasing amount of scientific literature. In the late 1990s the recognition of specific terms in biomedical texts has become a focus of bioinformatic research to automatically extract knowledge out of the increasing number of publications. For this, amongst other methods, machine learning algorithms are applied. However, the recognition (classification) capability of terms by machine learning or rule based algorithms depends on their correct and reproducible training and development. In the case of machine learning-based algorithms the quality of the available training and test data is crucial. The algorithms have to be tested and trained with curated and trustable data sets, the so-called gold or silver standards. Gold standards are text corpora, which are annotated by expertes, whereby silver standards are curated automatically by other algorithms. Training and calibration of neural networks is based on such corpora. In the literature there are some silver standards with approx. 500,000 tokens [REF3]. Also there are already published gold standards for species, genes, proteins or diseases. However, there is no corpus that has been generated specifically for miRNA. To close this gap, we have generated GoMi, a novel and manually curated gold standard corpus for miRNA.

ACE2 immunostaining was performed in transgenic mouse brain sections from neuron-specific enolase-AT(1A) (overexpressing AT(1A) receptors), R(+)A(+) (overexpressing angiotensinogen and renin), and control (nontransgenic littermates) mice. Results show that ACE2 staining is widely distributed throughout the brain.

In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood-brain barrier and sensitive to blood-borne angiotensin II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to nontransgenic mice. These results suggest that ACE2 is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain and that ACE2 levels appear highly regulated by other components of the renin-angiotensin system, confirming its involvement in this system. Moreover, ACE2 expression in brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that the carboxypeptidase may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and diseases involving the autonomic nervous system, such as hypertension.","output":"Differential expression of neuronal ACE2 in transgenic mice with overexpression of the brain renin-angiotensin system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The home advantage (HA) is a robust phenomenon in soccer whereby the home team wins more games and scores more goals than the away team.

METHODS: Two mitigation scenarios of SD for 1 month and continuous SD were compared with the baseline (no intervention). A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model accounting for disease spread during the latent period was applied by considering a 1-year time horizon. The costs of healthcare, school closures, and productivity loss due to disease as well as intervention were considered to estimate the total pandemic cost among all scenarios. RESULTS: In a comparison with the baseline, the result showed that total savings in scenarios of SD for 1 month and continuous SD was approximately $415 billion and $699 billion, respectively, while the averted deaths were 4.6 million and 8.5 million, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that basic reproduction number, infectious period, daily wage, incubation period, daily ICU admission cost, and case fatality rate were the most influential parameters affecting the savings and the number of averted deaths.

RESULTS Organizational access and citywide access across HIV/AIDS (mean = 1.94, SD = 0.83), mental health (mean = 1.37, SD = 0.95), substance use (mean = 1.11, SD = 0.74), and DV (mean = 1.49, SD = 0.97) services were perceived as far from optimal. Domain scores were highest for accessibility (mean = 1.66, SD = 1.03), followed by quality (mean = 1.44, SD = 0.79), availability (mean = 1.41, SD = .81), and adequacy (mean = 1.24, SD = .75). CONCLUSION Based on findings from a survey of staff working at Latino-serving organizations, this study highlights the lack of support and resources for Latino immigrants, in particular those related to mental health and substance use. Programs and interventions are needed to improve service delivery in Latino immigrant communities.","output":"Provider Perspectives on Latino Immigrants' Access to Resources for Syndemic Health Issues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The time to close the book on infectious disease is far from near. Infections seem to be here to stay and have increased in importance in spite of enormous success in the field of prophylactic efforts, hygiene, vaccinology, and treatment. A large number of new agents and infections have appeared during the last decades. Conditions earlier thought to have other etiologies are today known to be distinct and have been proven to be of infectious origin. Infections alone can constitute major incidents, or they can be part of or a consequence of an incident. Even in the relatively new incident category of terrorism, infections must be seriously considered. Climate change and other changes in nature today constitute major threats of increasing infectious incidents. The increasing problem with antimicrobial resistance is, at present, considered to be one of the strongest disease threats. Infectious incidents are unique in the sense that they usually have an insidious onset, have a time span before they are detected as present or even as serious. Once the infection has started to spread, the development and increase can be extremely quick, even logarithmic. The extent of infectious incidents can be larger than that of most other disasters, and is best exemplified through different pandemics. The most important weapon to control infectious outbreaks or epidemics is active surveillance, leading to different kind of actions.","output":"Infectious Diseases and Microbiological Threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The study investigates the effects of learning abilities, market changes and technological development in the field of the need for future skills.

Whether a positive test is associated with a high viral RNA load, specific viral variant, recovery of infectious virus, or symptomatic infection is largely not known. METHODS: In this study, we identified 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who had received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines, the 2nd of which was received between January and April of 2021. The positive samples were collected between January and May of 2021 with a time that extended from 2 to 100 days after the second dose. Samples were sequenced to characterize the whole genome and Spike protein changes and cycle thresholds that reflect viral loads were determined using a single molecular assay. Local SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were examined using ELISA and specimens were grown on cell culture to assess the recovery of infectious virus as compared to a control unvaccinated cohort from a matched time frame. RESULTS: Of 133 specimens, 24 failed sequencing and yielded a negative or very low viral load on the repeat PCR. Of 109 specimens that were used for further genome analysis, 68 (62.4%) were from symptomatic infections, 11 (10.1%) were admitted for COVID-19, and 2 (1.8%) required ICU admission with no associated mortality. The predominant virus variant was the alpha (B.1.1.7), however a significant association between lineage B.1.526 and amino acid change S: E484K with positives after vaccination was noted when genomes were compared to a large control cohort from a matched time frame. A significant reduction of the recovery of infectious virus on cell culture as well as delayed time to the first appearance of cytopathic effect was accompanied by an increase in local IgG levels in respiratory samples of vaccinated individuals but upper respiratory tract IgG levels were not different between symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination reduces the recovery of infectious virus in breakthrough infections accompanied by an increase in upper respiratory tract local immune responses.

This study aimed to investigate whether 2% CHG daily bathing reduced the acquisition of VRE in the setting of a medical ICU (MICU) with VRE endemicity. METHODS: This quasi-experimental intervention study was conducted in a 23-bed MICU of a tertiary care hospital in Korea from September 2016 to December 2017. In a prospective, interrupted time-series analysis (ITS) with a 6-month CHG bathing intervention, we compared the acquisition and incidence of VRE and the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. The primary and secondary outcomes were a change in the acquisition of VRE and incidence of VRE, MRSA, or CRAB between the two periods, respectively. RESULTS: All the adult patients admitted to the MICU were enrolled in the pre-intervention (n = 259) and intervention (n = 242). The overall CHG daily bathing compliance rate was 72.5%. In the ITS, there was a significant intervention effect with a 58% decrease in VRE acquisition (95% CI 7.1C82.1%, p = 0.038) following the intervention.

Materials and methods: We retrospectively examined 162 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and by using three computer software programs: (1) Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, United States; (2) Myrian, Intrasense, France; (3) InferRead, InferVision Europe, Wiesbaden, Germany. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist using a score on 5 levels (none, mild, moderate, severe, and critic). The parameters obtained using the computer tools included healthy residual lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacity area, and consolidation volume. Intraclass coefficient (ICC), Spearman correlation analysis, and non-parametric tests were performed. Results: Thoracic VCAR software was not able to perform volumes segmentation in 26/162 (16.0%) cases, Myrian software in 12/162 (7.4%) patients while InferRead software in 61/162 (37.7%) patients.

Solutions, Chantilly, VA) and the Clearify Visualization System (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). MATERIAL AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic renal procedures with the Fluid Warming System (first 20 cases) and then the Clearify Visualization System (second 20 cases). We utilized the standard Fluid Warming System per a 30-second modified protocol established in our laboratory. We used the Clearify according to manufacturer instructions. For each procedure we documented the etiology of each episode of visual obstruction, procedure type and surgery duration. We performed a cost analysis. For all cases we used the same insufflator, insufflation trocar location and trocar configuration. RESULTS All 40 patients completed the study protocol without incident. The mean fogging events per hour for the Fluid Warming System and Clearify Visualization System were 0.7 (0-2.52) and 1.4 (0-5.02), respectively (P = 0.045). Surgery duration and cost per procedure were similar for both systems.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has recommended clinicians discuss costs of cancer care with patients to enhance shared decision-making. We sought information to guide oncologists' discussions with patients about these costs. METHODS We searched Medline, EMBASE and clinical practice guideline databases from January 2009 to 1 June 2019 for recommendations about discussing the costs of care and financial burden. Guideline quality was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. RESULTS Twenty-seven guidelines met our eligibility criteria, including 16 from ASCO (59%). 21 of 27 (78%) guidelines included recommendations about discussion or consideration of treatment costs when prescribing, with information about actual costs in four (15%). Recognition of the risk of financial burden or financial toxicity was described in 81% (22/27) of guidelines. However, only nine guidelines (33%) included information about managing the financial burden. CONCLUSIONS Current clinical practice guidelines have little information to guide physician-patient discussions about costs of anticancer treatment and management of financial burden. This limits patients' ability to control costs of treatment, and for the healthcare team to reduce the incidence and severity of financial burden. Current guidelines recommend clinician awareness of price variability and high costs of treatment. Clinicians are recommended to explore cost concerns and address financial worries, especially in high risk groups. Future guidelines should include advice on facilitating cost transparency discussions, with provision of cost information and resources.","output":"Physician-patient communication of costs and financial burden of cancer and its treatment: a systematic review of clinical guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer cells grown as 3D-structures are better models for mimicking in vivo conditions than the 2D-culture systems employable in drug discovery applications. Cell cycle and cell death are important determinants for preclinical drug screening and tumor growth studies in laboratory conditions. Though several 3D-models and live-cell compatible approaches are available, a method for simultaneous real-time detection of cell cycle and cell death is required. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput adaptable method using genetically encoded fluorescent probes for the real-time quantitative detection of cell death and cell cycle. The cell-cycle indicator cdt1-Kusabira orange (KO) is stably integrated into cancer cells and further transfected with the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer-based ECFP-DEVD-EYFP caspase activation sensor. The nuclear cdt1-KO expression serves as the readout for cell-cycle, and caspase activation is visualized by ECFP/EYFP ratiometric imaging. The image-based platform allowed imaging of growing spheres for prolonged periods in 3D-culture with excellent single-cell resolution through confocal microscopy. High-throughput screening (HTS) adaptation was achieved by targeting the caspase-sensor at the nucleus, which enabled the quantitation of cell death in 3D-models. The HTS using limited compound libraries, identified two lead compounds that induced caspase-activation both in 2D and 3D-cultures.

With the involvement of the whole clinic staff we developed protection scenarios with the aim of achieving Covid-19-free clinics. Schedules were developed and implemented based on the epidemiological bulletins of the RKI (Robert Koch Institute, Germany) of 2017 (influenza infection) and 2020 (Covid-19). The effects of these measures were evaluated by means of a patient and employee survey. RESULTS: The challenges of the pandemic have been successfully implemented. Both the patient and employee surveys showed a high level of acceptance of the measures. For example, 98.5% of patients stated that the continuation of rehabilitation was important for their health, even in the pandemic situation. At the same time, 87% felt safe. 88% of all employees (MA) and 93% of MA in the risk group stated that the protective measures were introduced at the right time. At the same time, 76% of all employees and 84% of the employees in the risk group agreed with the additional burden. In spite of the high risk potential in the clinics (immunocompromised patients, patients from different districts with different levels of exposure), an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 could be avoided in the clinics.

The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the lives of many people. Any infectious and inflammatory process in the lungs can lead to adverse consequences for the whole organism. The pathological process affecting the respiratory structures of the lungs, bronchi leads to disruption of various links of the external respiration system;therefore, timely effective rehabilitation for such patients can improve the quality of life, reduce the period of temporary disability, and most importantly, restore the function of external respiration. The aim was to prove the effectiveness of the osteopathic methods application in the rehabilitation of patients after coronavirus pneumonia. Materials and methods. On the basis of the Primorsky Institute of Vertebroneurology and Manual Medicine (Vladivostok) the rehabilitation of patients with coronavirus pneumonia was carried out using osteopathic methods. 63 patients after suffering from coronavirus pneumonia were randomly divided into 2 groups comparable in terms of clinical and functional characteristics. The first group (main) consisted of 34 people (average age 65.51.5 years), of which 44.1 % were men and 55.9 % were women. Group 2 (control) included 28 patients (mean age 64.11.6 years), of which 32.1 % were men and 67.9 % were women. To assess the function of external respiration, spirometry was performed and the main indicators of the vital capacity of the lungs were assessed (vital capacity  VC, and FVC  forced vital capacity). To measure the saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood with oxygen (SpO2), pulse oximetry was performed. Rehabilitation included in the main group osteopathic correction (2 procedures), breathing exercises (4 procedures) and chest massage (4 procedures);in the control group there were breathing exercises (4 procedures) and chest massage (4 procedures). The rehabilitation course lasted 14 days. For the statistical analysis of the obtained data the Statistica-10 software package was used. Results. The studies revealed a pronounced change in the function of external respiration in patients who had undergone coronavirus pneumonia. According to the results of spirometry, more than 90 % of patients showed a statistically significant (p=0.006) decrease in VC compared to the physiological norm  both in the main group (VC down to 80.7 %) and in the control group (VC down to 87.6 %), as well as a significant (p=0.0001) decrease in FVC to 77.7 % in the main group and to 79.1 % in the control group. After rehabilitation, patients in the main group showed a statistically significant improvement in the function of external respiration, manifested in an increase in VC by 12.3 % (p<0.0001), FVC by 12.1 %. In patients in the control group (without osteopathic correction), after the rehabilitation, the main indicators of the function of external respiration also improved, but the changes were not statistically significant. As a result of rehabilitation, the patients of the main group showed a statistically significant SpO2 increasing (from 96.60.2 to 97.50.2 %, p=0.0013);in the control group, there was also a positive dynamics of these indicators, but the changes were not statistically significant. Conclusion. The results of the study allow to conclude that the inclusion of osteopathic correction methods in the rehabilitation of patients after coronavirus pneumonia has a positive effect on their state, improves the external respiration function indicators  VC and FVC, and also increases the SpO2. The obtained results allow to recommend the inclusion of osteopathic methods in the rehabilitation programs for patients who have undergone coronavirus infection. ? Anatoly F. Belyaev, Olga N.

CKRT were initiated in patients with persistently high blood ammonia levels ( 500 mol/L), blood ammonia levels > 250 mol/L in the presence of moderate encephalopathy, high blood leucine levels ( 1500 mol/L), and blood leucine levels < 1500 mol/L in the presence of deteriorating neurological status or persistent metabolic acidosis. RESULTS: Of 22 patients enrolled, nine (40.9%) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), eight (36.4%) urea cycle disorders (UCD), and five (22.7%) organic acidemias (OA). Median age was 72.3 [9.9C1040.8] days. In total, 28 dialysis sessions were analyzed [16 (57.1%) continuous venovenous hemodialysis, and 12 (42.9%) continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration]. A significant decrease was noted in leucine levels (from 1608.4  885.3 to 314.6  109.9 mol/L) of patients with MSUD, while ammonia levels were significantly decreased in patients with UCD and OA (from 1279.9  612.1 to 85.1  21.6 mol/L). The most frequent complications of CKRT were thrombocytopenia (60.7%), hypotension (53.6%), and hypocalcemia (42.9%). Median age of patients with hypotension treated with vasoactive medications was significantly lower than median age of those with normal blood pressure.

Along with a rapidly growing amount of location data, machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely adopted. A key reason is that ML inference is significantly more energy-efficient than GPS query at comparable accuracy, and GPS signals can become extremely unreliable for specific scenarios. To this end, several techniques such as deep neural networks have been proposed. However, during training, almost none of them incorporate the known structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful in indoor or other structured environments. In this paper, we argue that the state-of-the-art-systems are significantly worse in terms of accuracy because they are incapable of utilizing these essential structural information. The problem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly available, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. Given that both input and output space potentially contain rich structures, we study our method through the intuitions from manifold-projection. Whereas existing manifold based learning methods actively utilized neighborhood information, such as Euclidean distances, our approach performs Neighbor Oblivious Learning (NObLe).

Patients were divided into two groups based on suture material used: absorbable, polyglactin 910 sutures (44 patients); nonabsorbable, polyester sutures (50 patients). Preoperative measurements, ductions, strabismus surgery, and postoperative results were analyzed. Inadequate anchoring of the medial rectus muscle was suspected when consecutive exotropia developed 4-7 weeks after surgery after initial satisfactory alignment and was confirmed if during reoperation the medial rectus muscle appeared recessed >2 mm beyond the originally intended recession. RESULTS Consecutive exotropia due to inadequate anchoring of the medial rectus muscle occurred in 11 of 66 muscles (17%) in the absorbable suture group. The muscle was found 6-10 mm posterior to the intended recession. Limited duction in the field of action of the involved medial rectus muscle occurred in 9 of the 11 muscles (82%). None of the eyes with nonabsorbable sutures showed inadequate anchoring. The incidence of consecutive exotropia was higher in the absorbable suture group (30%) than in the nonabsorbable suture group (6%) (P < 0.005).

Substantial hurdles for this strategy are low-antigen content in crudely processed plant material and limited antigen stability in the gut. An alternative is intranasal delivery of purified plant-derived antigens expressed with robust viral vectors, especially virus-like particles.

METHODS The affinity and internalization kinetics of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 were determined in vitro. The optimal protein-fragment dose for imaging was determined in nude mice with a subcutaneous head and neck carcinoma model (FaDu). Mice with FaDu tumors were imaged using ultra-high-resolution SPECT with (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 or (111)In-cetuximab IgG at 4, 24, 48, and 168 h after injection. Tumor tracer uptake was determined on micro-SPECT and autoradiography images of tumor sections. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze EGFR expression in the tumor. RESULTS In vitro, more than 50% of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 was internalized into FaDu cells within 24 h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 and (111)In-cetuximab was similar: 0.42  0.16 nM versus 0.28  0.14 nM, respectively. The protein dose-escalation study showed that the highest uptake of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 in tumors was obtained at doses of 10 g/mouse or less (13.5  5.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]). Tumor uptake of (111)In-cetuximab was significantly higher (26.9  3.3 %ID/g, P < 0.01). However, because of rapid blood clearance, tumor-to-blood ratios at 24 h after injection were significantly higher for (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 (31.4  3.8 vs. 1.7  0.2, respectively; P < 0.001). The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 correlated well with the immunohistochemical distribution of EGFR (r = 0.64  0.06, P < 0.0001). micro-SPECT images of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 clearly showed preferential uptake in the tumor from 4 h onward, with superior tumor-to-background contrast at 24 h, compared with (111)In-cetuximab (107.0  17.0 vs. 69.7  3.9, respectively; P < 0.05).

This study aimed to establish if and how the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted the practice of routine prostate cancer screening in Verona, Italy. Methods We searched the laboratory information system of the Service of Laboratory Medicine of the University Hospitals of Verona to identify all test requests for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and vitamin D (Vit D; i.e., the locally most requested immunochemical test) for outpatients during the last five years (December 10, 2016, to December 10, 2020). The weekly requests for these tests placed between February 25 and December 9, 2020, were compared to those placed during the same period of previous four years (i.e., 2016-2019). Results The volume of test requests for both Vit D and PSA did not differ in 2020 compared to previous four years. However, a dramatic decline was observed during the local lockdown period (between March 10 and May 17, 2020), with median decrease of 76% for Vit D and 62% for total PSA, respectively. This reduction was compensated by 13% increase for Vit D and 43% increase for total PSA in post-lockdown period.

Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact tests were used to identify statistical associations of improvement with each categorical variable. Student's t-test was used to highlight the differences in mean values of continuous variables between subjects considered more cooperative and unimproved subjects. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Assumption of linearity of independent variables and log-odds were assessed by Box-Tidwell transformation. Final selection was carried out using the Akaike criterion and all statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical software package. RESULTS The sample consisted of 212 patients (103F; 109M). The age ranged between 3 and 16 years with an average age of 9.03 years; 82.08% (95% CI 76.24-86.99) of the subjects showed an improvement in collaboration compared to pre-lockdown. Logistic analysis reveals a statistically significant increase of the odds of improvement in patients with a lower pre-lockdown collaboration (OR: 6.05, p = 0.001), in children with a parental presence at home (jobless, OR : 30.55, p <0.001; in \\"smart working\\", OR: 23.06, p <0.001) when compared to children whose parents work away from home. From a further exploratory analysis, time dedicated to home oral hygiene was increased if associated with an increased presence of the parents at home (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION Changes in family routines and increased parental presence at home, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, are associated with improved collaboration of children during dental sessions. A statistical association between the increase in time spent on oral hygiene and the increased presence of parents at home was found.","output":"Impact of lockdown on children's lifestyle and their collaboration during dental sessions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a new method for determining similarity and anomalies between time series, most practically effective in large collections of (likely related) time series, with a particular focus on measuring distances between structural breaks within such a collection. We consolidate and generalise a class of semi-metric distance measures, which we term MJ distances. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate that our proposed family of distances uncover similarity within collections of time series more effectively than measures such as the Hausdorff and Wasserstein metrics. Although our class of distances do not necessarily satisfy the triangle inequality requirement of a metric, we analyse the transitivity properties of respective distance matrices in various contextual scenarios. There, we demonstrate a trade-off between robust performance in the presence of outliers, and the triangle inequality property. We show in experiments using real data that the contrived scenarios that severely violate the transitivity property rarely exhibit themselves in real data; instead, our family of measures satisfies all the properties of a metric most of the time. We illustrate three ways of analysing the distance and similarity matrices, via eigenvalue analysis, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering. The results from our hierarchical and spectral clustering experiments on simulated data demonstrate that the Hausdorff and Wasserstein metrics may lead to erroneous inference as to which time series are most similar with respect to their structural breaks, while our semi-metrics provide an improvement.","output":"Novel semi-metrics for multivariate change point analysis and anomaly detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most common congenital esophageal malformation.

Long Gap patients had a higher rate of prematurity and low birth weight. The prevalent surgical procedure was primary esophageal anastomosis, followed by gastric pull-up. Twenty-four patients had post-operative stenosis, while gastroesophageal reflux (GER) required fundoplication in eleven cases. Auxological parameters were lower in Long Gap patients. The lowest scores of QoL were in the Long Gap group, especially in younger patients, which was the group with the highest number of symptoms. In the long term, the QoL appeared to be more dependent on the type of esophageal atresia rather than on associated malformations. Surgical management of GER was indicated in all patients with Long Gap EA, supposedly due to the prevalence of gastric pull-up for this type of EA. The assessment of QoL is part of surgeons management and needs to be performed in each phase of a childs development.","output":"Congenital Esophageal Atresia Long-Term Follow-UpThe Pediatric Surgeons Duty to Focus on Quality of Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of social media data, like Twitter, for biomedical research has been gradually increasing over the years.

What is common for current educational reforms is that they tend to emphasize competencies that are not related to the traditional subject-matters and reflect a stance which presents learning as a naturally reflective and collaborative act. It is often assumed that teachers are automatically ready to implement ideas of this kind in practice. In this study, we propose that teachers theories about knowledge, knowing and learning, particularly their epistemic theories, may be related to how teachers approach these reforms which challenge their previous ways of working and how they perceive their wellbeing at work. To examine these matters, we explored the dynamic interrelations between teachers epistemic theories, conformity with the novel curricular and digital reforms (ideas behind the new curriculum and digitalization program), perceptions of the school leadership, work engagement and burnout. Participants (Study 1 n = 228;Study 2 n = 200) were Finnish class teachers and subject-matter teachers. Both data sets were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. For data analysis, we plotted correlation network figures. Results showed that if teachers epistemic theory was in harmony with the curricular or digital reforms, there is a positive association with work engagement and negative association with burnout. In sum, results of this provided a hint of the phenomenon suggesting that teachers epistemic theories may be a factor which buffers teachers to meet the current epistemic and developmental challenges of teachers profession, and furthermore, serve as grounds for a positive association for teachers to feel adequate and satisfied in their work.","output":"Exploring the Relations Among Teachers Epistemic Theories, Work Engagement, Burnout and the Contemporary Challenges of the Teacher Profession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine globally.

Influenza A/H5N1, in particular, has repeatedly caused human infections associated with high mortality, and since 1998 the virus has evolved into many clades of variants with significant antigenic diversity. In 2013, three (A/H7N9, A/H6N1, and A/H10N8) novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) breached the animal-human host species barrier in Asia. In humans, roughly 35% of A/H7N9-infected patients succumbed to the zoonotic infection, and two of three A/H10N8 human infections were also lethal; however, neither of these viruses cause influenza-like symptoms in poultry. While most of these cases were associated with direct contact with infected poultry, some involved sustained human-to-human transmission. Thus, these events elicited concern regarding potential AIV pandemics. This article reviews the human incursions associated with AIV variants and the potential role of pigs as an intermediate host that may hasten AIV evolution. In addition, we discuss the known influenza A virus virulence and transmission factors and their evaluation in animal models. With the growing number of human AIV infections, constant vigilance for the emergence of novel viruses is of utmost importance.

Hepatic involvement in COVID-19 could be multifactorial related to any of direct cytopathic effect of the virus, uncontrolled immune reaction, sepsis or drug induced liver injury. The postulated mechanism of viral entry is through the host ACE2 receptors that are abundantly present in type 2 alveolar cells. Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 receptors were identified in the gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium and cholangiocytes of the liver.

The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of an outpatient surgery protocol for acute closed ankle fractures. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 262 patients underwent outpatient surgery for their closed ankle fractures at our level-1 trauma centre. A total of 196 patients met our inclusion criteria and were ultimately included in the final analysis. Our primary outcomes' measures included post-operative admission to the emergency department within 30 days after surgery and unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days after surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) within 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (16.3%) had an unplanned emergency department visit within 30 days of fracture fixation and two patients (1.0%) required hospital readmission within 30 days of their surgery. Sixteen patients (8.2%) developed SSI, which included 11 (5.6%) superficial and five (2.6%) deep infections. CONCLUSION: Strategic outpatient management of acute closed ankle fractures is associated with acceptable rates of unplanned emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, and SSIs.

Banks can improve their operational efficiency and quality of service by relying on CyberTech, but they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity. Thus, increasing investment in CyberTech becomes a strategic necessity for banks to combat cybersecurity hazards. The study investigates how disruptive digital transformation affects bank stability. In particular, it examines whether the law of diminishing marginal returns from overspending on CyberTech affects bank stability. Based on a global sample from 43 countries, we find that an increase in CyberTech spending above the threshold level adversely affects the stability of banks. The main reason behind the adverse effect of CyberTech spending on the stability of banks is that banks take more than the proportional risk for every dollar they spend on disruptive CyberTech after they cross a threshold level of spending. While results persist across sub-samples, our results indicate two important channels of technological regimes C a diminishing returns regime and an increasing returns regime. The diminishing returns regime improves bank stability through more aggressive spending on technology, and the increasing returns regime makes banks more unstable due to excess spending on disruptive CyberTech. The study has implications for cybersecurity and sustainable CyberTech spending for banks.","output":"Does cyber tech spending matter for bank stability?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are becoming increasingly available and may serve as a diagnostic aid in a multitude of settings relating to past infection status. However, there is limited literature detailing the longitudinal performance of EUA-cleared serologic assays in US populations, particularly in cohorts with a remote history of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., > 2 months). METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (anti-N) and Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (anti-S1-RBD) assays, using 174 residual clinical samples up to 267 days post-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 154) and a subset of samples obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as negative controls (n = 20). RESULTS: The calculated diagnostic sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 89% and 93%, respectively. Of the 154 samples in the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort, there were 6 discrepant results between the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays, 5 of which were specimens collected  200 days post-PCR positivity and only had detectable levels of anti-S1-RBD antibodies. When only considering specimens collected  100 days post-PCR positivity (n = 41), the sensitivities for the anti-N and anti-S1-RBD assays were 85% and 98%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-S1-RBD assay demonstrated superior sensitivity at time points more remote to the PCR detection date, with 6 more specimens from the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort detected, 5 of which were collected more than 200 days post-PCR positivity. While analytical differences and reagent lot-to-lot variability are possible, this may indicate that, in some instances, anti-S1-RBD antibodies may persist longer in vivo and may be a better target for detecting remote SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Longitudinal Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Anti-Nucleocapsid and anti-Spike-1-RBD Antibody Testing Following PCR-Detected SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of SARS-CoV-2 has created a wave of pandemic around the globe due to its high transmission rate. To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well.

Though the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) repeatedly and subacute cerebral infarction and finally died for respiratory failure on day 30 after admission, these attempts appeared to dampen the cytokine storm based on the observed decline in serum IL-6 levels and were effective against ARDS and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This case suggests the significance of timely initiation of extracorporeal treatment approaches in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Continuous extracorporeal treatments in a dialysis patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Despite being common, neck injuries have received relatively little attention for important quality of care metrics. This study sought to determine the association between blunt and penetrating neck injuries on mortality and length of stay, and to identify additional patient and hospital-level characteristics that impact these outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study utilizing the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. METHODS: Adult patients (&#8805;18) who sustained traumatic injuries involving the soft tissues of the neck between 2012 and 2016 were eligible. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Logistic regression and negative binomial models were used to analyze 1) in-hospital mortality and 2) length of stay respectively while adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for clustering at the hospital level. RESULTS: In a cohort of 20,285 patients, the crude mortality rate was lower in those sustaining blunt neck injuries compared to penetrating injuries (4.9% vs. 6.0%, P < .01), while length of hospital stay was similar (median 9.9 vs. 10.2, P = 0.06). In adjusted analysis, blunt neck injuries were associated with a reduced odds of mortality during hospital admission (odds ratio: 0.66, 95% confidence intervals [0.564, 0.788]), as well as significant reductions in length of stay (rate ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence intervals [0.880, 0.954]).

The shelf stability of NEW sanitizer was, therefore, assessed under various storage conditions to guide the development of protocols for its industrial application. To that end, fresh NEW with an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 480 mg/L, pH 6.96, and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of 916 mV was stored under different conditions. These were open or sealed polypropylene bottles, three different surface area-to-volume (SA:V) ratios (0.9, 1.7, and 8.7), and two temperatures (4 and 25C). NEW stored at 4C was significantly more stable than NEW stored at 25C; ACC and pH decreased by 137 mg/L and 0.7, respectively, whereas ORP increased by 23 mV, after 101 days of storage. At 25C, ACC decreased to <0.01 mg/L after 52 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 8.7, with a similar decrease after 101 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 1.7. However, pH decreased by up to 3.7 pH units, and ORP increased by up to 208 mV. The antimicrobial efficacy of \\"aged\\" electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water with different ACC and ORP, but the same pH (i.e., 3.4  0.2), was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua to determine any differences in residual antimicrobial activity.

Methods Every pharmacy in NZ was reviewed online to determine what vaccination information they advertised, then a sample of pharmacies were randomly selected from six District Health Boards (DHBs) to be called and confirm if the information they stated online was accurate. Results Whilst the majority (more than 70%) of pharmacies did provide information about their services online, only 31% of the pharmacies had vaccination information on their websites, 20% on Healthpoint, and 13% had the information on social media. The telephonic survey revealed various information discrepancies in more than a quarter of the sample. Conclusions A lack of online presence across multiple pharmacies is a pressing issue.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records. RESULTS: Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female. At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home.

Many factors involved in the neuropathology of AD in DS, including epigenetic factors, innate immunity and impaired haematopoiesis, contribute significantly towards the pathophysiology and the enhanced ageing processes seen in DS and as a consequence of the triplication of genes RUNX1, S100 and OLIG2, together with the influence of proteins that collectively protect from cellular defects and inflammation, which include hepcidin, ferritin, IL-6 and TREM2. This study is aimed at determining whether genetic variants and inflammatory proteins are involved in haematopoiesis and cellular processes in DS compared with age-matched control participants, particularly with respect to neuroinflammation and accelerated ageing. Serum protein levels from DS, AD and control participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood smears and post-mortem brain samples from AD and DS subjects were analysed by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 mRNA expression was analysed by RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation in mouse tissues. Our results suggest that hepcidin, S100 and TREM2 play a critical role in survival and proliferation of glial cells through a common shared pathway. Blood smear analysis showed the presence of RUNX1 in megakaryocytes and platelets, implying participation in myeloid cell development. In contrast, hepcidin was expressed in erythrocytes and in platelets, suggesting a means of possible entry into the brain parenchyma via the choroid plexus (CP). The gene product of RUNX1 and hepcidin both play a critical role in haematopoiesis in DS. We propose that soluble TREM2, S100 and hepcidin can migrate from the periphery via the CP, modulate the bloodCbrain immune axis in DS and could form an important and hitherto neglected avenue for possible therapeutic interventions to reduce plaque formation.","output":"Impaired Iron Homeostasis and Haematopoiesis Impacts Inflammation in the Ageing Process in Down Syndrome Dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics.

Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity.

The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptor that plays a key role in stabilizing ECs and suppressing inflammation. To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed an increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene.

Activation of T2Rs leads to calcium-driven NO production that increases cilia beating and directly kills bacteria. Several airway diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, are characterized by epithelial remodeling, including loss of motile cilia and/or squamous metaplasia. To understand the function of T2Rs within the altered landscape of airway disease, we studied T2Rs in non-ciliated airway cell lines and primary cells de-differentiated to a squamous phenotype. In differentiated cells, T2Rs localize to cilia, however in de-differentiated, non-ciliated cells they localize to the nucleus. Cilia and nuclear import utilize many shared proteins, thus in the absence of motile cilia some T2Rs may target to the nucleus. T2R agonists selectively elevated both nuclear and mitochondrial calcium through a G-protein-coupled receptor, phospholipase C, and InsP3 receptor-dependent mechanism. Additionally, T2R agonists decreased nuclear cAMP, increased nitric oxide, and increased cGMP, consistent with T2R signaling. Furthermore, exposure to T2R agonists led to nuclear calcium-induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation. T2R agonists induced apoptosis in primary bronchial and nasal cells differentiated at air-liquid interface but then induced to a squamous phenotype by apical submersion. Air-exposed well-differentiated cells did not die. This T2R-induced apoptosis may be a last-resort defense against infection, possibly when bacteria have breached the epithelial barrier and reach non-ciliated cells below. However, it may also increase susceptibility of de-differentiated or remodeled epithelia to damage by bacterial metabolites. Moreover, the T2R-activated apoptosis pathway occurs in airway cancer cells. T2Rs may thus contribute to microbiome-tumor cell crosstalk in airway cancers. T2R agonists may also be useful topical therapeutics (e.g., delivered by nasal rinse or nebulizer) for activating airway cancer cell apoptosis without killing surrounding differentiated tissue.","output":"The bitter end: T2R bitter receptor agonists elevate nuclear calcium and induce apoptosis in non-ciliated airway epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A rapid and reproducible enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of canine coronavirus (CCV) specific antibodies directed to both the nucleocapsid (NC) and the spike (S) proteins.

As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons and the strategy for triaging non-emergent operations: a global neurosurgery study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lay Health Workers (LHW) are important providers of community mental health services and help mitigate access and treatment gaps in Africa. However, there is a paucity of knowledge about the role and performance of these workers, as well as about the extent to which the interventions delivered are culturally adapted to the African context. AIMS: This scoping review aimed to explore the content and aspects concerning the cultural adaptation and sustainability of psychological interventions delivered by LHW to people with mental disorders in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature published from January 2000 to December 2018 to identify psychological interventions delivered by LHW for people with mental disorders in Africa. We systematically searched PubMed, Google scholar and Hinari to select relevant publications. The articles were evaluated for risk of bias according to study design with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tools. Expert consultation was performed according to Arksey & OMalley framework and cultural adaptation analysis was performed according to Bernal framework. RESULTS: Out of 14,549 retrieved records, we identified ten peer-reviewed articles conducted in Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa and Zambia describing four distinct interventions. Six were randomized controlled trials; none addressed implementation outcomes. Group-based interpersonal therapy (n = 5), trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 1), problem solving therapy (n = 3) and narrative exposure therapy (n = 1) emerged as psychological interventions delivered by LHW for people with depression, anxiety, trauma and suicidal behavior. Psychological interventions delivered by LHW in Africa were all culturally adapted to meet the competence of LHW. All the interventions were associated with symptom improvement, but the quality of this evidence varied widely with study design. CONCLUSION: Task-shifting psychological interventions delivered by LHW after appropriate cultural adaptation show promise for addressing unmet mental health care needs in Africa. More effectiveness and implementation evidence is needed, especially with regard to psychological interventions delivered by LHW for adolescence, older people and those with severe mental disorders and suicidal behaviors.","output":"Cultural adaptation of psychological interventions for people with mental disorders delivered by lay health workers in Africa: scoping review and expert consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementing countrywide lockdown measures in India, from March 2020 to May 2020 was a major step to deal with the COVID -19 pandemic crisis. The decision of country lockdown adversely affected the urban migrant population, and a large section of them was compelled to move out of the urban areas to their native places. The reverse migration garnered widespread media attention and coverage in electronic as well as print media. The present study focuses on the coverage of the issue by print media using descriptive natural language text mining. The study uses topic modelling, clustering, and sentiment analysis to examine the articles on migration issues during the lockdown period published in two leading English newspapers in India- The Times of India and The Hindu. The sentiment analysis results indicate that the majority of articles have neutral sentiment while very few articles show high negative or positive polarity. Descriptive topic modelling results show that transport, food security, special services, and employment with migration and migrants are the majorly covered topics after employing Bag of Words and TF-IDF models.

This study examined the knowledge, preparedness and experiences of Australian emergency nurses, emergency physicians and paramedics in managing COVID-19. METHODS: A voluntary cross-sectional study of members of the College of Emergency Nursing Australasia, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, and the Australasian College of Paramedicine was conducted using an online survey (June-September 2020). RESULTS: Of the 159 emergency nurses, 110 emergency physicians and 161 paramedics, 67.3-78% from each group indicated that their current knowledge of COVID-19 was good to very good. The most frequently accessed source of COVID-19 information was from state department of health websites. Most of the respondents in each group (77.6-86.4%) received COVID-19 specific training and education, including personal protective equipment (PPE) usage. One-third of paramedics reported that their workload had lessened while 36.4-40% of emergency nurses and physicians stated that their workload had considerably increased. Common concerns raised included disease transmission to family, public complacency, and PPE availability. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive training and education and adequate support helped prepare emergency clinicians to manage COVID-19 patients. Challenges included inconsistent and rapidly changing communications and availability of PPE.","output":"Emergency clinicians knowledge, preparedness and experiences of managing COVID-19 during the 2020 global pandemic in Australian healthcare settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the global economy, banks all over the world experienced substantial reductions in loan growth and increases in distressed and non-performing assets. The persistent increase in non-performing loans accompanied by low interest rates led to a surge in banking risk, posing a solemn threat to banks stability. In this paper, we empirically assess the accounting- and market-based risks of banks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the growth rate of total COVID cases as our main predictor, we introduce a continuous variable to measure the pandemic and estimate its impact on banking risk and return volatility. Based on a quarterly panel of international banks over the period 2020:Q1 C 2021:Q1, we find that banks exhibit greater accounting risk and increased return volatility during the pandemic. In particular, we report that a 1% growth of total COVID cases reduces (increases) our sample banks z-score ( of quarterly return) by 0.756 (2.51%). Our results remain robust across alternative measures of the pandemic, z-score decomposition, and across daily and monthly stock returns. Further, we obtain consistent results for both U.S. and non-U.S. banks, as well as for banks from both high- and low-income economies. We use a propensity score matching method to deal with endogeneity. Additional tests reveal that government responses such as economic support, stringency, and containment play important roles in banking risk and stability during the pandemic.

The 320 molecular diagnostics in receipt of FDA emergency use authorization mainly focus on viral detection; however, no currently approved test can be used to infer infectiousness, i.e., the presence of replicable virus. As the number of tests conducted increased, persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity by RT-PCR in some individuals led to concerns over quarantine guidelines. To this end, we attempted to design an assay that reduces the frequency of positive test results from individuals who do not shed culturable virus. We describe multiplex quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays that detect genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) species of SARS-CoV-2, including spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and ORF8. The absolute copy number of each RNA target was determined in longitudinal specimens from a household transmission study. Calculated viral RNA levels over the 14-day follow up period were compared with antigen testing and self-reported symptoms to characterize the clinical and molecular dynamics of infection and infer predictive values of these qRT-PCR assays relative to culture isolation. When detection of sgS RNA was added to the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, we found a qRT-PCR positive result was 98% predictive of a positive culture (negative predictive value was 94%). Our findings suggest sgRNA presence correlates with active infection, may help identify individuals shedding culturable virus, and that similar multiplex assays can be adapted to current and future variants.","output":"Surveillance and correlation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, antigen, virus isolation, and self-reported symptoms in a longitudinal study with daily sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality and possible sleep bruxism (SB) in children eight to ten years of age. The study hypothesis was that sleep disturbances influenced a higher occurrence of bruxism during the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study was conducted at two time points: in person prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1), and online during the pandemic (T2). The sample comprised 105 children. Parents/caregivers answered a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic characteristics, the use of electronic devices, reported (vs. clinical) SB, and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) at both T1 and T2. McNemar's and Wilcoxon's tests were used to compare SB and sleep disorders at both time points. Poisson regression analysis determined the relative risk (RR) among the variables, and the incidence of possible SB (p0.05). The comparison of the two time points (T1 and T2) revealed a significant increase in possible SB (p<0.01) and sleep disorders (p < 0.04). Children whose parents had a lower schooling level (RR: 2.67; 95%CI: 1.19-6.01), those with their own electronic devices (RR: 1.97; 95%CI: 1.09-2.50), and those with sleep disorders during the pandemic (RR: 1.74; 95%CI: 1.35-2.24) were at greater risk of developing SB during the pandemic. Moreover, the incidence of bruxism and sleep disorders was greater during the pandemic. The factors influencing SB incidence during the pandemic were a lower level of mothers' schooling, greater access to electronic devices, and the occurrence of sleep disorders.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality and sleep bruxism in children eight to ten years of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 infection control measures have been recommended for dental practices worldwide This qualitative study explored barriers and enablers for the implementation of these measures in German dental practices Methods: Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted in November/December 2020 (purposive/snowball sampling) The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivations influencing Behaviors model (COM-B) were used to guide interviews Mayrings content analysis was employed to analyze interviews Results: All dentists (28C71 years, 4/8 female/male) had implemented infection control measures Measures most frequently not adopted were FFP2 masks, face shields (impractical), the rotation of teams (insufficient staffing) and the avoidance of aerosol-generating treatments Dentists with personal COVID-19 experience or those seeing themselves as a role model were more eager to adopt measures We identified 34 enablers and 20 barriers Major barriers were the lack of knowledge, guidelines and recommendations as well as limited availability and high costs of equipment Pressure by staff and patients to ensure infection control was an enabler Conclusions: Dentists are motivated to implement infection control measures, but lacking opportunities limited the adoption of certain measures Policy makers and equipment manufacturers should address these points to increase the implementation of infection control measures against COVID-19 and potential future pandemics","output":"Implementation of COVID-19 Infection Control Measures by German Dentists: A Qualitative Study to Identify Enablers and Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused lockdown situation impeding all educational institutions including dental colleges.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present protocol was to study the long-term viability of an isolated jejunal segment following neovascularization by omentoenteropexy. Long-term survival of a neovascularized bowel segment is an indication that the utilization of this segment as an intestinal graft can be successful. METHODS: To test the proposed surgical technique, 13 Wistar rats were subjected to laparotomy, the jejunum was exposed at 20 cm from the angle of Treitz and a pedicle of greater omentum was isolated. An incision of 6 cm was made along the antimesenteric jejunal border, exposing the submucosa. Omentoenteropexy was performed between the incision of the jejunum and the pedicle of the greater omentum. After seven weeks, the mesentery of the jejunal segment subjected to omentoenteropexy was ligated and isolated from the rest of the jejunum by a complete proximal and distal transversal section. Subsequently, an end-to-end anastomosis was performed to restore the continuity of the bowel. RESULTS: At 10 weeks from the first surgical intervention, the isolated jejunal segment subjected to omentoenteropexy was completely neovascularized and viable.

Billroth I reconstruction following distal gastrectomy has the physiological advantage of allowing food to pass through the duodenum. It was hypothesized that Billroth I reconstruction would be superior to Roux-en-Y reconstruction in terms of long-term QoL after distal gastrectomy. This study compared two reconstructions in a multicentre prospective randomized clinical trial to identify the optimal reconstruction procedure. METHODS Between January 2009 and September 2010, patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were randomized during surgery to Billroth I or Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The primary endpoint was assessment of QoL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Gastric (FACT-Ga) questionnaire 36 months after surgery. RESULTS A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, 60 to Billroth I and 62 to Roux-en-Y reconstruction. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative complications or mortality, and no significant differences in FACT-Ga total score (P = 0496).

SUBJECTS: Adults 18 years old and over with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019, their family members, members of the general public, and health professionals (including clinicians, policy makers, regulators, funders, and researchers). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: None. MAIN RESULTS: In total, 9,289 participants from 111 countries (776 people with coronavirus disease 2019 or family members, 4,882 health professionals, and 3,631 members of the public) completed the survey. The four outcomes of highest priority for all three groups were: mortality, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and organ failure. Lung function, lung scarring, sepsis, shortness of breath, and oxygen level in the blood were common to the top 10 outcomes across all three groups (mean > 7.5, median  8, and > 70% of respondents rated the outcome as critically important). Patients/family members rated fatigue, anxiety, chest pain, muscle pain, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiovascular disease higher than health professionals. Four themes underpinned prioritization: fear of life-threatening, debilitating, and permanent consequences; addressing knowledge gaps; enabling preparedness and planning; and tolerable or infrequent outcomes.

No other epidemics or pandemics have been politicized at such a level since ancient times. The full political spectrum from right to left has tried to ride this pandemic and upset the public health response efforts. Statistics and politics have changed our daily approach to this brutal infection, but even crueler has been the palpable miscommunication. Massive and uncontrolled lockdowns and not climate change are destroying the economy of our planet. Intolerance against vaccine opponents and hesitant families has been vocalized with martial tones in both social media and news channels.

The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the role of preoperative computed tomography (CT) screening for COVID-19 in a population of COVID-19 asymptomatic patients scheduled for cardiac surgery. Between the 29th of March and the 26th of May 2020, patients asymptomatic for COVID-19 underwent a CT-scan the day before surgery, with reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) reserved for abnormal scan results. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of abnormal scans, which was evaluated using the CO-RADS score, a COVID-19 specific grading system. In a secondary analysis, the rate of abnormal scans was compared between the screening cohort and matched historical controls who underwent routine preoperative CT-screening prior to the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. Of the 109 patients that underwent CT-screening, an abnormal scan result was observed in 7.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.2-14.0%). One patient, with a normal screening CT, was tested positive for COVID-19, with the first positive RT-PCR on the ninth day after surgery. A rate of preoperative CT-scan abnormalities of 8% (na?=a?8) was found in the unexposed historical controls (P > 0.999). In asymptomatic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative screening for COVID-19 using computed tomography will identify pulmonary abnormalities in a small percentage of patients that do not seem to have COVID-19. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19, this results in an unfavorable positive predictive value of CT screening.

METHODS A cost-effectiveness study comparing prophylaxis versus on-demand was conducted on 34 hemophilia patients (24 and 10 patients were on the prophylaxis and on-demand regimens respectively) in 2017. The Markov model was used to estimate the economic and clinical outcomes. The costs were collected from the societal perspective, and the utility criterion was the 'quality adjusted life year (QALY)' indicator. The required data were collected using a researcher-made cost checklist, the EQ5D standard questionnaire and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS The means of costs, joint health score and QALY in the prophylaxis regimen were $478,963.1 purchasing power parity (PPP), 96.67, and 11.98 respectively, and in the on-demand regimen were $521,797.2 PPP, 93.46 and 10.99 respectively. The PSA confirmed the robustness of the model's results. The results of the scatter plots and acceptability curves showed that the prophylaxis regimen in 97% of the simulations for the thresholds below $20950 PPP was more cost-effective than on-demand regimen. CONCLUSION Prophylaxis regimen showed the lower costs and higher effectiveness and utility in comparison with the on-demand regimen. It is recommended that prophylaxis should be considered as the standard care for treatment of hemophilic patients.","output":"A cost-effectiveness analysis of the prophylaxis versus on-demand regimens in severe hemophilia A patients under 12 years old in southern Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Black women in the United States disproportionately suffer adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes compared to White women. Economic adversity and implicit bias during clinical encounters may lead to physiological responses that place Black women at higher risk for adverse birth outcomes. The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) further exacerbated this risk, as safety protocols increased social isolation in clinical settings, thereby limiting opportunities to advocate for unbiased care. Twitter, 1 of the most popular social networking sites, has been used to study a variety of issues of public interest, including health care. This study considers whether posts on Twitter accurately reflect public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic and are being used in infodemiology studies by public health experts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of Twitter for identifying public discourse related to social determinants of health and advocacy that influence maternal health among Black women across the United States and to examine trends in sentiment between 2019 and 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from March 1 to July 13, 2020, from 21 organizations and influencers and from 4 hashtags that focused on Black maternal health. Additionally, tweets from the same organizations and hashtags were collected from the year prior, from March 1 to July 13, 2019. Twint, a Python programming library, was used for data collection and analysis. We gathered the text of approximately 17,000 tweets, as well as all publicly available metadata. Topic modeling and k-means clustering were used to analyze the tweets. RESULTS: A variety of trends were observed when comparing the 2020 data set to the 2019 data set from the same period. The percentages listed for each topic are probabilities of that topic occurring in our corpus. In our topic models, tweets on reproductive justice, maternal mortality crises, and patient care increased by 67.46% in 2020 versus 2019. Topics on community, advocacy, and health equity increased by over 30% in 2020 versus 2019. In contrast, tweet topics that decreased in 2020 versus 2019 were as follows: tweets on Medicaid and medical coverage decreased by 27.73%, and discussions about creating space for Black women decreased by just under 30%. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic may have spurred an increased focus on advocating for improved reproductive health and maternal health outcomes among Black women in the United States. Further analyses are needed to capture a longer time frame that encompasses more of the pandemic, as well as more diverse voices to confirm the robustness of the findings.

We estimated the effect of a comprehensive and systematic set of public health policies on the growth rate in the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases across the 37 member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the period January 1 - July 1 2020.Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis using a multilevel growth model. The dependent variable was the average daily growth rate in weekly SARS-CoV-2 cases, the policy regressors were ordinal variables of the intensity of the following: school closing requirements, workplace closing requirements, public events cancelling requirements, restrictions on gatherings, public transport restrictions, stay at home requirements, restrictions on internal movement, international travel controls, public health information campaigns, mask wearing requirements, testing policy and contact tracing policy. We used both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation to fit the model.Findings: Restrictions on gatherings, mask wearing requirements, school closing requirements, work closing requirements and total number of tests per thousand population were, in that order, significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic control.Interpretation: These findings provide evidence to support policy decision-making regarding which policies to maintain or (re-)initiate in order to control the current spread of the epidemic and any future surge of COVID-19.Funding Statement: None.Declaration of Interests: All of the co-authors of this paper declare that we have no competing interests.","output":"Impact of Type and Timeliness of Public Health Policies on COVID-19 Epidemic Growth: Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Member States, January C July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper is devoted to the participation of the TUDublin team in Constraint@AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection Challenge.

METHOD: This manuscript discusses knowledge related to the critical considerations of patient and caregiver safety relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the operating room environment. RESULTS: During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required contingent upon local availability of COVID\\\\19 testing and the incidence of known COVID\\\\19 infection in the respective community. In addition to standard COVID\\\\19 PPE precautions, a negative\\\\pressure environment, including an OR, has been recommended, especially for the performance of aerosol\\\\generating procedures (AGPs). Hospital spaces ranging from patient wards to ORs to endoscopy rooms have been successfully converted from standard positive\\\\pressure to negative\\\\pressure spaces. Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered. Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles. Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management.

Managers, part-timers, and those in the operating room and the outpatient ward were excluded from the study as it is limited to bedside preventive care. The original tool was translated into Japanese using the Brislin's translation model. A cross-sectional study was used to examine the reliability and validity of the measure within a Japanese sample. Assessment of the multiple-choice test items included analysis of the validity (item difficulty and discriminating index), construct validity, internal consistency, and stability (test-retest reliability). RESULTS: The item difficulty indices ranged from 0.17 to 0.95, whereas values for item discrimination ranged from 0.15 to 0.45.

Small food retail stores that accept SNAP/EBT are important food sources for low-income Americans, especially in areas where traditional grocery stores are difficult to access. SNAP-Ed recognizes healthy food retail interventions as an approach to encourage healthy eating and support direct nutrition education. Small food retail stores that accept SNAP/EBT in low-income census tracts were targeted. Shop Smart Tennessee is an 8-week small food retail program that uses taste testing, educational handouts, and in-store marketing to encourage healthy customer selections. In response to COVID-19, in-store program components were modified for the pilot to be delivered on social media. Food demonstration videos were developed to replace taste testings, and educational handouts were translated to social media posts. Educators posted videos and educational content to the partnering store's Facebook page or tagged the store in posts. To assess the effectiveness of online delivery methods we used participant surveys linked to food demonstration video posts, social media metrics, and nutrition educator feedback. Five stores participated in this pilot. Thirty-seven videos were posted to Facebook with 4,320 views and 863 engagements. Forty-three people completed online participant surveys, with 89% (n = 38) responding they would likely make the recipe at home. Nutrition educator feedback suggested store managers were supportive of online delivery and that it was an acceptable alternative to in-store programming. This pilot demonstrated that components of food retail programming can be adapted for social media. This method was well received by participants, store managers and nutrition educators. It allowed us to reach store customers from a different angle and can be used to inform future food retail work involving social media.

To date, little evidence is available about the effect of lockdown release in terms of adolescent health from the perspective of an emergency department (ED). METHODS: We reviewed data on ED arrivals of adolescents and young adults (aged 13-24 years) in the weeks immediately before and after the Italian lockdown release in 2020, and in the same periods in 2019, with a focus on cases of severe alcohol abuse, psychomotor agitation, and other mental issues. RESULTS: The relative frequency of severe alcohol intoxications increased from .88% during the last part of the lockdown to 11.3% after lockdown release. When comparing these data with the same period in 2019, a highly significant difference emerged, with severe alcohol intoxications accounting for 11.31% of ED visits versus 2.96%, respectively. The relative frequency of ED arrivals related to psychomotor agitation or other mental health issues was not significantly increased after lockdown release. CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that emergency services should be prepared for a possible peak of alcohol intoxication-related emergencies in adolescents and young adults.

Since anti-spike mAbs, used individually, might be unable to block the virus entry in the case of resistant mutations, we designed an innovative strategy for the isolation of multiple novel human scFvs specific for the binding domain (RBD) of Spike. By panning a large phage display antibody library on immobilized RBD, we obtained specific binders by eluting with ACE2 in order to identify those scFvs recognizing the epitope of Spike interacting with its receptor. We converted the novel scFvs into full size IgG4, differently from the previously isolated IgG1 mAbs, to avoid unwanted potential side effects of IgG1 potent effector functions on immune system. The novel antibodies specifically bind to RBD in a nanomolar range and interfere in the interaction of Spike with ACE2 receptor, either used as purified protein or when expressed on cells in its native conformation. Furthermore, some of them have neutralizing activity for virus infection in cell cultures by using two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the highly contagious VOC 202012/01 variant and could become useful therapeutic tools to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Novel human neutralizing mAbs specific for Spike-RBD of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of artificial intelligence has led to a better investigation of many complex research problems from a variety of domains.

The disease, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria, can currently be treated efficiently with antibiotics. However, in the case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, alternative treatments are required. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has shown efficient antibacterial activity in various experimental animal models and in human patients infected with different MDR pathogens. Herein, we evaluated the efficiency of ?A1122 and PST phage therapy, alone or in combination with second-line antibiotics, using a well-established mouse model of pneumonic plague. Phage treatment significantly delayed mortality and limited bacterial proliferation in the lungs. However, the treatment did not prevent bacteremia, suggesting that phage efficiency may decrease in circulation. Indeed, in vitro phage proliferation assays indicated that blood has inhibitory effects on lytic activity, which may be the major cause of treatment inefficiency. Combining phage therapy and second-line ceftriaxone treatment, which are individually insufficient, provided protection that led to survival of all infected animals, presenting a synergistic protective effect that represents a proof of concept for efficient combinatorial therapy in an emergency event of a plague outbreak involving MDR Y. pestis strains. Author summary Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria, can be efficiently treated with antibiotics. However, alternative therapies for the case of natively evolved or maliciously generated antibiotic-resistant Y. pestis must be developed. Due to the global increase in antibiotic resistance, there is renewed interest in examining the effectiveness of bacteriophage-based alternative therapies. Here, using a mouse model of pneumonic plague, we demonstrate that phage treatment significantly delayed mortality. By monitoring bioluminescence of engineered Y. pestis strain and live bacterial counts, we show that phage therapy effectively inhibited bacterial proliferation in the lung but not in blood. In vitro analyses showed decreased phage activity in the presence of blood, which probably explains the low efficacy of phage treatment alone. Because combination therapies will be used in an emergency situation, we tested the efficacy of Y. pestis-lysing phages as adjunctive therapy with a second-line antibiotic, ceftriaxone. Whereas each individual treatment was insufficient, the combination provided effective protection and rescued all infected animals. These results clearly demonstrated the synergistic effect of combined phage and antibiotic therapy and represent a proof of concept for this alternative therapy against multidrug-resistant Y. pestis strains.","output":"Phage therapy potentiates second-line antibiotic treatment against pneumonic plague"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Academic research on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 among Native Americans has largely been restricted to particular indigenous groups or reservations. OBJECTIVE: We estimate COVID-19 mortality for Native Americans relative to other racial/ethnic groups and explore how state-level mortality is associated with known risk factors. METHODS: We use the Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR), adjusted for age and county, to estimate COVID-19 mortality by racial/ethnic groups for the U.S. and 10 selected states. The prevalence of risk factors is derived from the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: The SMR for Native Americans greatly exceeds those for Black and Latino populations and varies enormously across states. There is a strong correlation between the share of Native Americans living on a reservation and the SMR. The SMR for Native Americans is also highly correlated with the income-poverty ratio and the prevalence of multigenerational families, crowded housing, frontline worker status, and health insurance (excluding the Indian Health Service). Risk factors associated with socioeconomic status and co-morbidities are generally more prevalent for Native Americans living on homelands, a proxy for reservation status, than for those living elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Most risk factors for COVID-19 are disproportionately high among Native Americans, particularly for those living on homelands. Reservation life appears to increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality.

In addition, a quantitative gap analysis was conducted to assess the different awareness and demands on services of ASP and preferred antimicrobial-related problems (ARP). In overall, perceptions of ASP varied by profession. The identified setbacks were unorganized institutional leadership, the undefined roles of healthcare professionals, a lack of reimbursement, the hierarchical structure of the health system, and the labor-intensive working environment of pharmacy services. Although demands for ASP improvement were similar among professionals, they had different preferences in prioritizing each service item of ASP/ARP development and the profession responsible for each service. Continuous administrative and financial investments, understanding ASP contents, ASP-specific information technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration with good communication among healthcare professions are needed to continue the progression of ASP.","output":"Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in Community Health Systems Perceived by Physicians and Pharmacists: A Qualitative Study with Gap Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) use was required while performing aerosol-generating procedures. We studied the physiologic effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS: Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and faceshield (FS); N95 FFR, SM, and FS; and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous electrocardiographic frequency-based heart rate (HR) variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing an SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS: Ten of 12 gastroenterologists (83%) reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine of these gastroenterologists (75%) had associated significant HR elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2) = 7.543, P = .004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of the N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratios and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effects in the N95 FFR stage. PAPR use was better tolerated but was associated with headache and elevated HR in 4 gastroenterologists (33%).

This paper aimed to clarify key issues around loneliness among older adults and draw attention to innovative programs and the translation of emerging research into practice. Loneliness is a mismatch between a person's actual and desired social connections, experienced as negative emotions. Older adults are vulnerable to loneliness because of changes associated with ageing. As such, identifying as older is often seen as a burden, negatively impacting self-esteem, sense of purpose and relevance, culminating in loneliness. Interventions combatting loneliness can target individuals, relationships, communities or societies. We advocate for an intersectoral approach to support healthy ageing and reduce loneliness. This will require further research to evaluate new approaches with loneliness as the primary outcome, and additional funding to translate evidence into an integrated multi-level approach to addressing loneliness.","output":"Loneliness in older age: What is it, why is it happening and what should we do about it in Australia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was investigated as a therapeutic target for potent antiviral drugs due to its essential role in not only viral replication but also in regulating the inborn immune response.

Eighty-one compounds, sub-structurally similar to the antiviral drug, were used as potential inhibitors of PLpro. From our results, three complexes containing the ligands with Pubchem IDs: 153012995, 12149203, and 123608715 showed lower binding energies than the control (Ritonavir), indicating that they may become promising inhibitors for PLpro. MD was performed in a water solvent to validate the stability of the three complexes. All complexes achieved stable structure during the simulation as no significant fluctuations were observed in the validation parameters. Moreover, the binding energy for each complex was estimated using the MM-GBSA method. Complex 1 was the most stable structure based on the lowest binding energy score and its structure remained in a similar cavity with the docket snapshot. Based on our studies, three ligands were assumed to be potential inhibitors.

There is a lot of evidence for the possible role of oxidative stress in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the current study, we aimed to measure the levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) in the serum of patients with Covid-19. A total of 96 individuals with and without Covid-19 were enrolled and divided into four groups, including hospitalized group in non-intensive care units (non-ICU) (n=35), hospitalized group in intensive care units with endotracheal intubation (EI) (ICU with EI) (n=19), hospitalized group in intensive care units without endotracheal intubation (ICU without EI) (n=24), and healthy people without Covid-19 disease as our control group (n=18).The present study revealed that the TOS level was significantly lower in the group of control (P = 0.001), and level of (GSH) remarkably increased in the patients' groups (P < 0.001). TAC activity in non-ICU group of patients had no significant difference in comparison with control group. However, in hospitalized patients' groups in ICU with and without EI this activity was significantly different from control group (P<0.001). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the levels of TOS, GSH, and TAC with blood Oxygen saturation (SpO2), fever, duration of hospitalization, and the prognosis of this disease (P<0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) (CI, 95%) of TOS, TAC and GSH-C to predict death among patients were respectively 0.907 (0.841, 0.973), 0.735 (0.626, 0.843) and 0.820 (0.725, 0.914). ROC curve analysis showed that TOS, TAC and GSH-C have the potential specificity and sensitivity to distinguish between alive and dead patients. We found that elevated levels of oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidant indices can aggravate disease's severity in hospitalized patients with Covid-19.

A key challenge of controlling COVID-19 is the large proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains even harder. Unfortunately, till now there is still a lack of cost-effective approaches to detect ACCs except doing a medical screening of the entire population. This paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory for COVID-19 tracing (STEM-COVID) for identifying ACCs from contact tracing data. Based on fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART), STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is implemented based on recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experimental results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and efficiency.","output":"Who Are the 'Silent Spreaders'?: Contact Tracing in Spatio-Temporal Memory Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary artery remodeling that may subsequently culminate in right heart failure and premature death.

As a unique medical treatment, traditional herbal medicine (THM) treatment has gradually exerted its advantages in treating PAH worldwide through a multi-level and multi-target approach. Additionally, the potential mechanisms of THM were deciphered, including suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, controlling the processes of inflammation and oxidative stress, and regulating vasoconstriction and ion channels.

Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, fundamental questions as to how sensory information is represented on a population scale remain unanswered. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body (MB) represents an excellent model to analyze sensory coding and memory plasticity. In this work, we present an experimental setup coupled with a dedicated computational method that provides in vivo measurements of the activity of hundreds of densely packed somata uniformly spread in the MB. We exploit spinning-disk confocal 3D imaging over time of the whole MB cell body layer in vivo while it is exposed to olfactory stimulation. Importantly, to derive individual signal from densely packed somata, we have developed a fully automated image analysis procedure that takes advantage of the specificities of our data. After anisotropy correction, our approach operates a dedicated spot detection and registration over the entire time sequence to transform trajectories to identifiable clusters. This enabled us to discard spurious detections and reconstruct missing ones in a robust way. We demonstrate that this approach outperformed existing methods in this specific context and made possible high-throughput analysis of approximately 500 single somata uniformly spread over the MB in various conditions. Applying this approach, we find that learned experiences change the population code of odor representations in the MB. After long-term memory (LTM) formation, we quantified an increase in responsive somata count and a stable single neuron signal.

Mitigation measures such as social distancing are here assumed to minimize a utility function that consists of two conflicting sub-targets, the disease related mortality and the multifaceted consequences of mitigation. The relative weight of the two sub-targets defines the mitigation readiness H, which entails the political, social, and psychological aspects of decision making. The dynamics of social and behavioral mitigation thus follows an adaptive rule, which in turn is mediated by a non-adaptive dynamics of H. This framework for social dynamics is integrated into an epidemiological model and applied to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Unperturbed simulations accurately reproduce diverse epidemic and mitigation trajectories from 2020 to 2021, reported from 11 European countries, Iran, and 8 US states. High regional variability in the severity and duration of the spring lockdown and in peak mortality rates of the first SARS-CoV-2 wave can be explained by differences in the reconstructed readiness H. A ubiquitous temporal decrease of H has greatly intensified second and third waves and slowed down their decay. The unprecedented skill of the model suggests that the combination of an adaptive and a non-adaptive rule may constitute a more fundamental mode in social dynamics.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of researches and practices on the monitoring and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage have been carried out to assist the fight against COVID-19. Hong Kong's research and experience in using sewage monitoring to control the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 provided an important reference for the development of the methodology in wastewater-based epidemiology, the establishment of technological platforms, and the planning and design of the infrastructure of future cities. The interdisciplinary research team of environmental microbiology, engineering and public health of the University of Hong Kong, with the strong supports and in collaboration with relevant departments of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), has first developed the laboratory analytical method, then conducted testing and explorations in local communities, and finally established a comprehensive sewage monitoring network for Hong Kong. The analytical method developed by the team consists of a two-step separation step and the detection of two gene segments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for determining the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. The research and development results demonstrated that sewage surveillance could be applied in Hong Kong for the following purposes. (1) Providing early warning signals for COVID-19 outbreak: The research showed that the sewage surveillance results have correlated very well with the fourth wave of epidemic outbreaks in Hong Kong since mid-November of 2020. The detection of viruses in sewage could be used as supplementary information to complement clinical testing to provide early warning signals of community outbreak. (2) Tracking the trend of community outbreak: During the epidemic, the changes in the detection rate of viruses in sewage can be used to assess the trend of the epidemic in the community. (3) Complementing the monitoring of infection clusters in local communities/housing estates: In response to the development of the fourth wave of the epidemic in Hong Kong, the research team flexibly adjusted the monitoring plan, conducted targeted sampling and analysis at buildings/housing estates/street blocks with infection clusters, and provided complementary information for clinical tests. Between 28 December 2020 and 9 February 2021, compulsory testing notices were issued in 26 buildings/street blocks of Hong Kong where sewage test results were positive, including compulsory testing in \\"restricted areas\\". More than 50 confirmed COVID- 19 cases were identified, cutting off hidden transmission chains in these communities. The sewage monitoring system of SARS-CoV-2 has now been fully implemented in Hong Kong by EPD (Environmental Protection Department) and DSD (Drainage Services Department), covering over 100 regular sampling sites in Hong Kong, providing early warning signals of COVID-19 re-emergence for over five million people, and has also become an important basis for follow-up epidemic prevention work. Using this system, the HKU team successfully identified the Delta variant in a sewage sample collected on June 21, 2021 from Tai Po, and alerted the first introduction of the Delta variant in the community sewage of Hong Kong before the relevant clinical case was reported. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region took quick action according to sewage test results and stopped the transmission. Following the success in the development of sewage testing methods worldwide, the research and developments should focus on better use of in-manhole samplers, selecting the most suitable sewage sampling time windows, simplifying the sample pre-treatment procedure, increasing the sampling and testing capacity, developing new methods for varia ts and integrating clinical/ epidemiological data, to further develop the sewage surveillance system into a more powerful tool to facilitate decision-making in fighting SARS-CoV-2. At present, it has been clearly realized that sewage monitoring can play an important role in controlling the spread of diseases. Many cities are gradually establishing and improving sewage monitoring systems and using this system as a part of future smart cities to protect public health from known and new pathogens.

Poor communication is the most commonly cited reason for conflict and is exacerbated when providers and families cannot find common ground and develop mutual trust. It is critically important that healthcare providers learn strategies to better partner with families in order to optimize patient medical and psychosocial outcomes. This requires providers to avoid falling prey to their own implicit (or unconscious) biases, including those towards families labeled as difficult. Building a healthy family-provider relationship is part of a healthcare providers duty to treat, has a measurable effect on patient outcomes, and sets up a foundation for the provider-family dyad to more easily navigate any conflicts that do develop. Once a relationship is built, providers and families can talk through their conflicts. They are more likely to have open and transparent communication and are more able to give each other the benefit of the doubt when navigating difficult situations and/or behaviors, rather than labeling each other as intrinsically difficult people.","output":"The Hard Talk: Managing conflict in the cardiac intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic trombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare phenomenon, that may present with diffuse and atypical symptoms.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to examine how people consume chestnut honey as a form of traditional medicine, and how it might protect them from COVID-19. METHODS This study was carried out on 177 people (who had been snowball sampled) from a province in Turkey where chestnut honey is widely produced. The data was collected using a twenty open/closed-question online questionnaire form that asked the participants about their socio-demographic details, about how they consume chestnut honey consumption, and about COVID-19. RESULTS Forty one point eight (41.8%) per-cent of the participants reported that they used chestnut honey to protect themselves against COVID-19, 40.7% of them believed that chestnut honey helped make them immune towards COVID-19, and 37.3% of them felt that chestnut honey could treat COVID-19.

After its first introduction to Turkey in 2009, it quickly became the major pest of tomato growing areas. Although some biocontrol agents have been used especially in greenhouses, the main control of T. absoluta relies heavily on chemical insecticides. However, failure in chemical control has often been reported due to resistance development. In this study, we investigated: 1) the population structure of 22 T. absoluta populations across Turkey, by analysing haplotypes, based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene; 2) the efficacy of three registered insecticides from different classes (metaflumizone, chlorantraniliprole and spinosad) in real field - greenhouse conditions; 3) the geographic distribution of target-site mutations associated with insecticide resistance. RESULTS The efficacy of spinosad was higher than chlorantraniliprole and metaflumizone in the greenhouse trials, as documented by the mortality rates obtained, up to 14 days post application. Known resistance mutations in ryanodine receptors (RyR) (i.e. the I4790M/K and G4946E), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (G275E), acetylcholinesterases (A201S) and voltage-gated sodium channels (F1845Y and V1848I) were found at various frequencies, across the populations genotyped. The I4790K diamide resistance mutation in the RyR has been reported for the first time in T. absoluta populations. Although a total of 8 haplotypes were found, the overall mean genetic distance was lower than 0.001 indicating the high genetic homogeneity among Turkish T. absoluta populations.

The use of remote cardiac telemetry as an alternative to 12?lead electrocardiography (ECG) for continuous QTc monitoring may facilitate this strategy, but its application has not yet been validated or implemented. METHODS: In the validation component of this two-part prospective cohort study, a total of 65 hospitalized patients with simultaneous ECG and telemetry were identified. QTc obtained via remote telemetry as measured by 3 independent, blinded operators were compared with ECG as assessed by 2 board-certified electrophysiologists as the gold-standard. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of linear correlation between the two methods. In a separate cohort comprised of 68 COVID-19 patients treated with combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, telemetry-based QTc values were compared at serial time points after medication administration using Friedman rank-sum test of repeated measures. RESULTS: Telemetry-based QTc measurements highly correlated with QTc values derived from ECG, with correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.79, 0.85 (individual operators), and 0.84 (mean of all operators). Among the COVID-19 cohort, treatment led to a median QTc increase of 15 milliseconds between baseline and following the 9th dose (p = 0.002), with 8 (12%) patients exhibiting an increase in QTc  60 milliseconds and 4 (6%) developing QTc  500 milliseconds.

Due to the sudden imposition of isolation and concrete needs, Berardi suggests that death has re-entered contemporary discourse. As a consequence, he speculates that the capitalist postponement of joy may be replaced by time as enjoyment. This text critically accompanies Berardi in imagining the possible outcome of the pandemic by suggesting that it is not death but mortality that offers a pivotal use of time and enjoyment. Mortality, as Hannah Arendt defines it, extends beyond the temporality of survivalist labour and into durable works that contribute to the construction of a human world. Here it is argued that this world and its work is held together by love, in a robust philosophical sense, that is embodied by amateur practice, primarily developed in relation to the work of Bernard Stiegler. Through the work of Stiegler, Donna Haraway and Byung-Chul Han, this paper argues that, masked by professionalism and marketing, amateurism lurks in the possible ruins of pre-COVID life, ready to emerge in the key areas identified by Berardis texts.

In the 20th century embalming became a tradition despite substantial evidence indicating environmental and occupational hazards related to embalming fluids and carbon dioxide generated from manufacturing steel coffins before placing in concrete burial vaults. Embalming is promoted and considered helpful to the grieving process. Embalmers are expected to produce an illusion of rest, an image that in some ways disguises death for the benefit of mourners. The dead are carefully displayed in a condition of liminal repose where the 'true' condition is hidden, and death is removed from the actual event.

Risks associated with acquiring the virus have been found to most significantly vary by age and presence of underlying comorbidity. In this rapid literature review we explore the prevalence of comorbidities and associated adverse outcomes among individuals with COVID-19 and summarize our findings based on information available as of May 15, 2020. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar to find articles published until May 15, 2020. All relevant articles providing information on PCR tested COVID-19 positive patient population with clinical characteristics and epidemiological information were selected for review and analysis. RESULTS: A total of 27 articles consisting of 22,753 patient cases from major epicenters worldwide were included in the study. Major comorbidities seen in overall population were CVD (8.9%), HTN (27.4%), Diabetes (17.4%), COPD (7.5%), Cancer (3.5%), CKD (2.6%), and other (15.5%). Major comorbidity specific to countries included in the study were China (HTN 39.5%), South Korea (CVD 25.6%), Italy (HTN 35.9%), USA (HTN 38.9%), Mexico, (Other 42.3%), UK (HTN 27.8%), Iran (Diabetes 35.0%).

We also found that proteins 8b and 8ab could physically interact with IRF3. Overexpression of 8b and 8ab resulted in the reduction of poly (I:C)-induced IRF3 dimerization and inhibition of the IFN- signaling pathway. This counteracting effect was partially mediated by protein 8b/8ab-induced degradation of IRF3 in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. Taken together, we propose that SARS-CoV may exploit the unique functions of proteins 8b and 8ab as novel mechanisms to overcome the effect of IFN response during virus infection.","output":"Accessory proteins 8b and 8ab of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus suppress the interferon signaling pathway by mediating ubiquitin-dependent rapid degradation of interferon regulatory factor 3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Specific criteria for de-escalation from the PICU are often not included in viral bronchiolitis institutional pathways.

We aimed to decrease the time from reaching floor-appropriate heated high flow nasal cannula (HHF) settings to the transfer decision by 20% through standardizing PICU-to-floor transfer assessment in a PICU bronchiolitis cohort. METHODS: We included PICU bronchiolitis admissions from October 2019 to April 2020, who were 6-months to 2-years-old with no comorbidities nor intubation during their encounter. Our intervention bundle included introduction of transfer criteria and standardization of transfer-readiness assessment. The primary outcome was time from reaching floor-appropriate HHF settings [8 L per minutes (Lpm)] to placement of the transfer order (time-to-transfer decision). The secondary outcome was PICU length of stay. The main process measure was the proportion of patients transferred on 6 Lpm HHF. Balancing measures included Rapid Response Team activation and unplanned PICU readmission. We assessed admissions meeting inclusion criteria from December, 2018-March, 2019 for the preintervention baseline. RESULTS: Special cause variation indicated improvement in our primary outcome and process measures.

Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2(b)-restricted epitopes (S436C443 and S525C532) and one H-2(d)-restricted epitope (S366C374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers. The optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of SARS-CoV infection.","output":"Identification of murine CD8 T cell epitopes in codon-optimized SARS-associated coronavirus spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Post-hysterectomy vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is rare.

A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR V diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP(+) repurification results in >90% LAP(+)FOXP3(+) Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3(-) and FOXP3(+) nonTregs within the LAP(-) population. After 4-week expansion, the LAP(+) Tregs were >1 billion cells, highly suppressive and anergic in vitro, >90% demethylated in the TSDR and able to maintain TCR V diversity.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV binding site and is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells of several organs, with the highest levels in the cardiovascular system, kidney and lungs. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is involved in ectodomain shedding of ACE2. In the present study, reverse-transcription-quantitative PCR, transfection, TUNNEL assay, dual-luciferase activity assay and western blotting were conducted to investigate the effects of microRNA (miR)-28-3p on ADAM17-dependent shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain following treatment with the spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2. It was found that miR-28-3p was significantly downregulated in 293T cells treated with 100 ng/ml of S-protein for 24 h at 37C, which led to upregulation of ADAM17. In addition, the expression of ADAM17 and miR-28-3p were negatively correlated based on Pearson's correlation test in 293T cells treated with S-protein for 24 h. Overexpression of miR-28-3p and inhibition of ADAM17 regulated 293T cell viability, apoptosis and ACE2 ectodomain shedding. It was also demonstrated that ADAM17 was the target gene of miR-28-3p and that miR-28-3p negatively regulated ADAM17 expression. Notably, the inhibition of ADAM17 expression blocked the effects of miR-28-3p inhibitor on proliferation, apoptosis and ACE2 ectodomain shedding in 293T cells treated with S-protein. The findings of the present study suggested that miR-28-3p inhibits ADAM17-dependent ACE2 ectodomain shedding in 293T cells treated with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, which suggested the potential therapeutic role of miR-28-3p mimic in the prevention and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"MicroRNA-28-3p inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ectodomain shedding in 293T cells treated with the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by targeting A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the association between glycemic control before admission with severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019, and tried to reveal the mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 77 inpatients were grouped into sufficient control group (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] <6.5%, n = 49) and insufficient control group (HbA1c &#8805;6.5%, n = 28). Regression models were used to analyze the clinical data. RESULTS: Compared with patients with HbA1c <6.5, patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5 showed higher heart rate (101 vs 89 b.p.m., P = 0.012), lower percutaneous oxygen saturation (93 vs 97%, P = 0.001), higher levels of multiple indicators of inflammation, such as white blood cell count (7.9 vs 5.9  109 /L, P = 0.019), neutrophil count (6.5 vs 4.1  109 /L, P = 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (52 vs 30 mg/L, P = 0.025) and serum ferritin (1,287 vs 716 g/L, P = 0.023), as well as lower levels of lymphocyte count (0.7 vs 0.8  109 /L, P = 0.049) at hospital admission. Thus, patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5 were more likely to develop secondary respiratory infections (25 [89%] vs 33 [67%], P = 0.032) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (17 [61%] vs 14 [29%], P = 0.006) than patients with HbA1c <6.5, resulting in a higher proportion of critically ill patients (19 [68%] vs 18 [37%], P = 0.009) and non-survivors (13 [46%] vs 11 [22%], P = 0.029). After adjustment for potential risk factors, HbA1c was independently associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: HbA1c was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

Yet it remains unclear whether-and how-these concepts impact resuscitation team performance. In the context of ad hoc teams in prehospital, emergency department, and trauma domains, even less is known about their relevance and impact. METHODS This scoping review, guided by PRISMA-ScR and Arksey & O'Malley's framework, included a systematic search across five databases, followed by article selection and extracting and synthesizing data. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they pertained to NTS for resuscitation teams performing in prehospital, emergency department, or trauma settings. Articles were subjected to descriptive analysis, coherence analysis, and citation network analysis. RESULTS Sixty-one articles were included. Descriptive analysis identified fourteen unique non-technical skills. Coherence analysis revealed inconsistencies in both definition and measurement of various NTS constructs, while citation network analysis suggests parallel, disconnected scholarly conversations that foster discordance in their operationalization across domains. To reconcile these inconsistencies, we offer a taxonomy of non-technical skills for ad hoc resuscitation teams. CONCLUSION This scoping review presents a vigorous investigation into the literature pertaining to how NTS influence optimal resuscitation performance for ad hoc prehospital, emergency department, and trauma teams. Our proposed taxonomy offers a coherent foundation and shared vocabulary for future research and education efforts. Finally, we identify important limitations regarding the traditional measurement of NTS, which constrain our understanding of how and why these concepts support optimal performance in team resuscitation.","output":"Examining non-technical skills for ad hoc resuscitation teams: a scoping review and taxonomy of team-related concepts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN) enable store-carry-and-forward data transmission in networks challenged by frequent disruptions and high latency.

We analyzed the transmission routes of nosocomial COVID-19 and discussed infection control strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing results according to time point and evaluated transmission routes. RESULTS: Since COVID-19 was first confirmed in a healthcare worker (HCW) on 11/13/2020, we performed RT-PCR tests for all patients and caregivers and four complete enumeration surveys for all HCWs. We detected three clusters of nosocomial spread and several sporadic cases. The first cluster originated from the community outbreak spot, where an asymptomatic HCW visited, which led to a total of 22 cases. The second cluster, which included patient-to-patient transmission, originated from a COVID-19 positive caregiver before diagnosis and the third cluster involved a radiologist and a banker. We took measures to isolate Building 1 of the hospital for 17 days and controlled the outbreak during a period of increasing community COVID-19 prevalence. Universal screening of all inpatients upon admission and resident caregivers was made mandatory and hospital-related employees are now screened monthly.

Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3.

It is documented that health-seeking behaviors change during pandemics. The objective of this study was to examine social determinants associated with decisions to seek dental care in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 4372 participants were invited to this cross-sectional web-based survey distributed from April 21 to June 20, 2020. The survey included a list of emergency, urgent, and routine dental procedures. Participants were asked if they would seek dental care for these conditions during the pandemic, and what pain severity would make them seek dental treatment. Logistic regression models were performed for predicting variables that explain the decision to go or not to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for each dental condition. RESULTS: A total of 3443 responded to this survey. The emergency dental situation participants were most willing to go to the dental clinic for was trauma involving facial bones compromising the airway (94.5%). Only 65.8% were willing to seek care for facial cellulitis compromising the airway. On average 35.2% reported seeking teleconsultation as the first step. Eighteen percent of participants were still willing to go to the dental clinic during the pandemic for routine dental procedures. Multiple logistic regression showed that females (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.6, OR 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), people who had never visited a dentist (OR: 1.8, OR 95% CI 1.3, 2.5), and people living in metropolitan regions (OR: 1.8, OR 95%: 1.4, 2.3) had higher odds for not seeking emergency dental care during this pandemic. The pain threshold for seeking dental care during the pandemic was 7 out of 10.

The fundamental properties, such as electronic structure, interatomic bonding, partial charge distribution, and dielectric response function at 0 and 310 K are analyzed, comparing them in dry and solvated models. These accurate microscopic parameters determined from highly reliable quantum mechanical calculations are useful to define the range and strength of complex molecular interactions occurring between the RGD peptide and the integrin receptor. The in-depth bonding picture analyzed using a novel quantum mechanical metric, the total bond order (TBO), quantifies the role played by hydrogen bonds in the internal cohesion of the simulated structures. The TBO at 310 K decreases in the dry model but increases in the solvated model. These differences are small but extremely important in the context of conditions prevalent in the human body and relevant for health issues. Our results provide a new level of understanding of the structure and properties of the 1FUV peptide and help in advancing the study of RGD containing other peptides.","output":"Solvent Effect on the Structure and Properties of RGD Peptide (1FUV) at Body Temperature (310 K) Using Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For epidemiologic, social and economic reasons, assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection prevalence and immunity are important to adapt decisions to current demands. Hence, immunoassays for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are introduced rapidly without requiring FDA emergency use authorization approval. Thus, evaluation of test performance predominantly relies on laboratories. This study aimed to evaluate the test performance of recently launched commercial immunoassays in serum and plasma samples. METHODS: 51 serum samples from 26 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after end of quarantine and 25 control patients were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope to assess diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. 20 matching pairs of serum and plasma samples were included to analyze comparability between different specimens. RESULTS: Overall, a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, 96.2-100% and 100% with a respective diagnostic specificity of 100%, 100% and 84-86% for the immunoassays from Roche, Euroimmun and Epitope were determined. In total, 84-96% of samples were correctly classified as negative and 92.3-95.2% as positive. The level of concordance between plasma- and serum-based testing diverged between the assays (Epitope r2 = 0.97; Euroimmun r2 = 0.91; Roche r2 = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The immunoassays from Euroimmun and Roche revealed a higher specificity than the Epitope assay without a substantial drop of diagnostic sensitivity. Significant differences between plasma- and serum-based testing highlights the need for determination of appropriate cut-offs per specimen type. Hence, there is an urgent need for test harmonization and establishment of quality standards for an appropriate use of COVID-19 serological tests.","output":"Comparison of test performance of commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in serum and plasma samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Several lines of emerging pharmacological and epidemiological evidence imply that overall risks related to COVID-19 may be reduced by green tea catechins. Therefore, it may be expected that: (i) higher green tea consumption is associated with lower COVID-19 morbidity and/or mortality; (ii) countries with higher per/capita green tea consumption would be less affected by COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the second possibility. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: Among countries with at least 3 million population (n=134), countries with relatively high (above 150 g) per/capita green tea consumption have been tentatively identified (n=21); (ii) normalized to population values of COVID-19 cases (morbidity) and deaths (mortality) for groups of countries with high and low per/capita green tea consumption were compared. Results: Striking differences in COVID-19 morbidity (and mortality) between groups of countries with higher and lower green tea consumption. The differences were still observed after the adjustment for the onset of the disease. Besides, preliminary analysis using multiple linear regression approach suggests that the associations are present at the level of individual countries. Conclusion: Evidence supporting the idea that green tea constituents could reduce overall risks related to COVID-19 has been obtained. The results are promising and are in line with emerging evidence from other studies including pharmacological ones. Nevertheless, because of limitations of this study the idea still should be considered as a hypothesis requiring further assessment.","output":"COVID -19: could green tea catechins reduce the risks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian astroviruses comprise a diverse group of viruses affecting many avian species and causing enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis. To date, six different astroviruses have been identified in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys, ducklings, pigeons, and guinea fowl; and TAstrovirus-2-like viruses have also been found in guinea fowl. Astroviruses are commonly associated with enteric disease syndromes in poultry including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), and enteritis in guinea fowl. The molecular characterization of the different avian astroviruses shows great genetic variability among each type, and this variability influences the ability to detect these viruses by molecular and serological techniques.

The pathogenesis of depression involves the interaction of complex biological components such as the immune system and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Adjunctive lifestyle-oriented approaches for depression, including physical exercise and special diets are promising therapeutic options when combined with traditional antidepressants. However, the mechanisms of action of these strategies are incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that physical exercise and specific dietary regimens can modulate both the immune system and gut microbiota composition. Here, we review the current information about the strategies to alleviate depression and their crosstalk with both inflammatory mechanisms and the gut microbiome. We will further discuss the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a potential mediator for the adjunctive therapies for depression through inflammatory mechanisms. Finally, we will review existing and potential future adjunctive strategies to manipulate the gut microbiota with potential use for depression, including physical exercise, dietary interventions, prebiotics/probiotics, and faecal microbiota transplantation.","output":"Inflammation, Lifestyle Factors, and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: Relevance to Depression and Antidepressant Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The book consists of 14 independent chapters, written by academic librarians from the United States and Canada, that each present a case study in which student wellness is centered within the academic library.

BACKGROUND: The transition to remote schooling and associated confinement during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic presents challenges for families, particularly when children are struggling with mental health and learning challenges. METHODS: Data were collected via an online survey between May and June 2020. Before the pandemic, almost half of the children received special education services. RESULTS: Findings revealed that although a minority of children were doing well with remote schooling, the majority were struggling due to lack of motivation and an inability to work independently. Some parents voiced challenges with teacher communication and inconsistencies across classes and were overwhelmed by the demands of their new role as proctor/teacher. Some were dissatisfied with how children's school services had been implemented and noted difficulties with the online format of various services (e.g., therapy was less engaging). Regarding children's mental health, half of parents said it had stayed the same, one third said it had worsened, and the remainder said it had improved. The mental health of children adopted via foster care seemed to have benefited from the additional time spent at home. Yet most children were described as struggling in part due to social isolation and loss of routine, which manifested in a variety of ways, including anxiety, schoolwork avoidance, and boundary testing. Most parents tried to show patience, tolerance, and reassurance, but more than one third reported stress and frustration associated with not knowing how to best support their children. CONCLUSION: The transition to remote schooling during COVID\\\\19 may be especially challenging for adoptive families and other families whose children have higher levels of need. IMPLICATIONS: Findings have implications for parents, teachers, school social workers and psychologists, and other professionals who work with children and families.","output":"School\\\\age adopted children's early responses to remote schooling during COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global lifestyle, and the spreading of the virus is unprecedented. This study aims to assess the association between the meteorological indicators such as air temperature (C), relative humidity (%), and wind speed (w/s) and solar radiation with the COVID-19 total confirmed and death cases in the hot, arid climate of Bahrain. We used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, Kendall rank correlation coefficient measures, and the Wavelet Transform Coherence approach for econometric analysis. The dataset analysis from April 1, 2020, to January 10, 2021. The result shows that the air temperature and humidity, wind speed, PM2.5 indicators have a mild coherence and significant association with the COVID-19 total confirmed cases. In contrast, they have a significant positive association with the COVID-19 total cumulative death cases, especially during the summer period. A positive correlation was indicated between wind speed, PM2.5, and the COVID-19 outbreak. Although this region experienced a high solar radiation incident, the solar radiation has no association with the COVID-19 pandemic total confirmed or death cases. The study suggests that the association between humidity, wind speed, air quality needs to be further examined to spread the outbreak of infectious COVID-19 diseases. The finding of this long-term analysis will help this region's countries take a significant measure to control the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Long terms assessment of the meteorological indicators with COVID-19 pandemic of Bahrain for second wave measure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain and cognitive development is a burgeoning area of scientific inquiry, with tremendous potential to better the lives of children.

Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide. Methods Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes A total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, X^2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, X^2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found. Interpretation SR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized.

Immunotherapies that reinvigorate immune responses by targeting immune checkpoints like PD-1/PD-L1 have proved successful in cancer therapy. Immune cell inhibitory receptors that trigger Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific immunosuppression, however, are unknown. Here, we show that the levels of CD84, a SLAM family receptor, increase in T and B cells in lung tissues from M. tuberculosis-infected C57BL/6 mice and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pulmonary TB patients. M. tuberculosis challenge experiments using CD84-deficient C57BL/6 mice suggest that CD84 expression likely leads to T and B cell immunosuppression during M. tuberculosis pathogenesis and also plays an inhibitory role in B cell activation. Importantly, CD84-deficient mice showed improved M. tuberculosis clearance and longer survival than M. tuberculosis-infected wild-type (WT) mice. That CD84 is a putative M. tuberculosis infection-specific inhibitory receptor suggests it may be a suitable target for the development of TB-specific checkpoint immunotherapies. IMPORTANCE Immune checkpoint therapies, such as targeting checkpoints like PD-1/PD-L1, have proved successful in cancer therapy and can reinvigorate immune responses. The potential of this approach for treating chronic infectious diseases like TB has been recognized, but a lack of suitable immunotherapeutic targets, i.e., immune cell inhibitory receptors that trigger immunosuppression specifically during Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis, has limited the application of this strategy in the development of new TB therapies. Our focus in this study was to address this gap and search for an M. tuberculosis-specific checkpoint target. Our results suggest that CD84 is a putative inhibitory receptor that may be a suitable target for the development of TB-specific checkpoint immunotherapies.","output":"CD84 is a Suppressor of T and B Cell Activation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we generalize fuzzy \\\\module, as intuitionistic fuzzy \\\\submodule of \\\\module (IFM), and utilize it for modeling the spread of coronavirus in air travels.

Medical students who have been in home confinement and who accepted to participate in an online survey were targeted. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, and data related to home confinement were collected.

The identification of proteins associated with PEDV infection might provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis and facilitate the development of novel antiviral strategies. We analyzed the differential protein profile of PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells using mass spectrometry and an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification. A total of 126 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed between the PEDV-infected and mock-infected groups (P < 0.05, quantitative ratio 1.2), among which the expression of 58 proteins was up-regulated and that of 68 proteins was down-regulated in the PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells, involving in integrin 2/3, cystatin-C. The Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the molecular function of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was primarily related to binding and catalytic activity, and that the biological functions in which the DEPs are involved included metabolism, organismal systems, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and diseases. Among the disease-related functions, certain anti-viral pathways and proteins, such as the RIG-I-like receptor, Rap1, autophagy, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K-Akt and Jak-STAT signaling pathways, and integrin 2/3 and cystatin-C proteins, represented potential factors in PEDV infection.

This study aimed to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community-level antibiotic use. METHODS: Using national antibiotic dispensing data from IQVIAs CompuScript database, this ecological study investigated antibiotic dispensing through community retail pharmacies in Canada from November 2014 to October 2020. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, prescription origin, and approximate indication. RESULTS: Adjusting for seasonality, the national rate of antibiotic dispensing in Canada decreased by 26.5% (50.4 to 37.0 average prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants) during the first eight months of the Canadian COVID-19 period (March to October 2020), compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Prescribing rates in children 18 years decreased from 43.7 to 12.2 prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants in males (-72%) and from 46.8 to 14.9 prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants in females (-68%) in April 2020. Rates in adults 65 decreased from 74.9 to 48.8 prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants in males (-35%) and from 91.7 to 61.3 prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants in females (-33%) in May 2020. Antibiotic prescriptions from family physicians experienced a greater decrease compared to surgeons and infectious disease physicians.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to assess the extent to which interest in gun preparation has increased amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns. METHODS: We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up to the week that US President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency. We used this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred, and reported observed deviations from this counterfactual. RESULTS: Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95% CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred. In absolute terms, approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation were performed over just 34 days.

However, the possibility of COVID-19 being a potential trigger for A- + ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) in these patients needs elucidation. Our study aimed at analyzing such a cohort of patients and determining their natural course of -cell recovery on serial follow-up. METHODS: After initial screening, n = 42 previously non-diabetic patients with new-onset DKA and RT-PCR positive COVID-19, were included in our ten-month follow-up study. Of these, n = 22 were negative (suspected A- + KPD) and n = 20 were positive (Type 1A DM) for autoantibodies (GAD/IA-2/ZnT8). Subsequently, n = 19 suspected KPD and n = 18 Type 1A DM patients were followed-up over ten months with serial assessments of clinical, biochemical and -cell secretion. Amongst the former, n = 15 (79%) patients achieved insulin independence, while n = 4 (21%) continued to require insulin at ten-months follow-up. RESULTS: On comparison, the suspected KPD patients showed significantly greater BMI, age, Hba1c, IL-6 and worse DKA parameters at presentation. Serial C-peptide estimations demonstrated significant -cell recovery in KPD group, with complete recovery seen in the 15 patients who became insulin independent on follow-up. Younger age, lower BMI, initial severity of DKA and inflammation (IL-6 levels), along-with reduced 25-hydroxy-Vitamin-D levels were associated with poorer recovery of -cell secretion at ten-month follow-up amongst the KPD patients, CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to demonstrate progressive recovery of -cell secretion in new-onset A- + KPD provoked by COVID-19 infection in Indian adults, with a distinctly different profile from Type 1A DM. Given their significant potential for -cell recovery, meticulous follow-up involving C-peptide estimations can help guide treatment and avoid injudicious use of insulin.","output":"Characterizing progressive beta-cell recovery after new-onset DKA in COVID-19 provoked A-+ KPD (ketosis-prone diabetes): A prospective study from Eastern India()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many cases of pneumonia with extensive lung abnormalities on CT-scans. The consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia on survivors pulmonary function and quality of life are unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived dyspnoea. Methods. A prospective longitudinal cohort study regarding patients discharged from our hospital after PCR-proven, non-critical COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. Cases were classified as moderate or severe pneumonia according to WHO definitions. Six weeks post-discharge subjects underwent interviews and pulmonary function tests, and completed questionnaires to assess their HRQoL, perceived dyspnoea (Borgscale and mMRC), and symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS). Results. 101 patients were included. Twenty-eight (27.7%) pneumonias were classified as moderate cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and 73 (72.3%) were classified as severe cases. Diffusion limitation (DLCOc < 80% of predicted value) was found in 66 (71.7%) of 92 cases, obstruction in 26 (25.7%) of 101, and restriction in 21 (21.2%) of 99. Diffusion capacity was significantly lower in cases after severe pneumonia. In the entire group, HADS scores 8 for depression were found in 16.6% and in 12.5% for anxiety. Across all SF-36 domains, except for bodily pain, significant impairment was found. FEV1 and DLCOc showed significant positive correlations with mMRC scores and multiple SF-36 domains, especially physical functioning. Conclusion.

In addition to the limitations of antimicrobial drugs associated with low transportation rate, water solubility, oral bioavailability and stability, inefficient drug targeting, considerable toxicity, and limited patient compliance, the major cause for their inefficiency is the antimicrobial resistance of microorganisms. In this context, the risk of a pre-antibiotic era is a real possibility. For this reason, the research focus has shifted toward the discovery and development of novel and alternative antimicrobial agents that could overcome the challenges associated with conventional drugs. Nanotechnology is a possible alternative, as there is significant evidence of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of nanomaterials and nanoparticles in particular. Moreover, owing to their considerable advantages regarding their efficient cargo dissolving, entrapment, encapsulation, or surface attachment, the possibility of forming antimicrobial groups for specific targeting and destruction, biocompatibility and biodegradability, low toxicity, and synergistic therapy, polymeric nanoparticles have received considerable attention as potential antimicrobial drug delivery agents.

Because of the wide spreading of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), acute stroke care is negatively impacted. How much acute care for stroke has been affected during the pandemic remains to be assessed. Methods: The first-level response to major public health was launched from January 24th to April 29th, 2020 in Beijing to contain the spread of COVID-19. Based on a database connecting all 77 stroke centers, the quantity and quality in emergency care for stroke during the 97 lockdown days were compared with the equivalent period in 2019. During the pandemic, 15 of the 77 stroke centers were designated to receive patients sick with COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were carried out by different types of hospitals (designated and undesignated). Results: There were 1,281 and 2,354 stroke emergency hospital admissions in the lockdown period and the parallel period in 2019, respectively. A reduction of 45.6% in admission was shown in the lockdown period, with more reductions for hemorrhagic stroke (69.0%) compared with ischemic stroke (42.9%). More reductions happened in COVID-19 designated hospitals (52.6%) compared with undesignated hospitals (41.8%). The mean NIHSS score at hospital arrival was significantly higher in the lockdown period (9.4  7.7 in 2020 vs. 8.4  7.8 in 2019, P < 0.001). For the metrics measuring the quality of acute stroke care, the onset to door (OTD), onset to needle (ONT), and onset to recanalization (OTR) times didn't change significantly, while significant delays are shown for the door to CT scan (DTC, 1 min delay), door to needle (DTN, 4 min delays), and door to puncture (DTP, 29 min delays) times, which mainly happened in COVID-19 undesignated hospitals.

The urgency stems from the frequent tendency to focus attention on seemingly high promising digital health interventions despite being poorly validated in times of crisis. AIM: In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this crisis. METHODS: Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of 26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this manuscript. RESULTS: Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and research during COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the local, national, and international levels.

Currently, no vaccine is commercially available for prevention, and the epidemic is still spreading. Here, we constructed a recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV) (PRV-gE/gI/TK-(CD2v)) that expresses the CD2v protein of ASFV and evaluated its effectiveness and safety as a vaccine candidate in mice. METHODS: A homologous recombination fragment containing ASFV CD2v was synthesized and co-transfected into HEK 293 T cells, a knockout vector targeting the PRV TK gene. The transfected cells were infected with PRV-gE/gI, and the recombinant strain (PRV-gE/gI/TK-(CD2v)) was obtained by plaque purification in Vero cells. The expression of ASFV CD2v in the recombinant virus was confirmed by sequencing, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analysis, and the genetic stability was tested in Vero cells over 20 passages. The virulence, immunogenicity and protective ability of the recombinant virus were further tested in a mouse model. RESULTS: The PRV-gE/gI/TK-(CD2v) recombinant strain is stable in Vero cells, and the processing of CD2v does not depend on ASFV infection. The vaccination of PRV-gE/gI/TK-(CD2v) causes neither pruritus, not a systemic infection and inflammation (with the high expression of interleukin-6 (IL6)). Besides, the virus vaccination can produce anti-CD2v specific antibody and activate a specific cellular immune response, and 100% protect mice from the challenge of the virulent strain (PRV-Fa). The detoxification occurs much earlier upon the recombinant virus vaccination and the amount of detoxification is much lower as well. CONCLUSIONS: The PRV-gE/gI/TK-(CD2v) recombinant strain has strong immunogenicity, is safe and effective, and maybe a potential vaccine candidate for the prevention of ASF and Pseudorabies.","output":"The recombinant pseudorabies virus expressing African swine fever virus CD2v protein is safe and effective in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES In order to meet the needs of the COVID-19 public health crisis and to actively engage students in patient care opportunities, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy in partnership with the Tennessee Health Department, developed a remote Public Health Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) Elective.

In general, social presence research has mainly focused on uni-directional aspects of each exchanged message, not on bidirectional interactions. Our primary purpose is to introduce such bidirectional evaluation by quantifying the degree of social presence with a few statistical measures. To this end, we developed a software called TypeTrace that records all keystrokes of online chat interactants and reenacts their typing actions and analyzed the results from different chat conditions, mainly focusing on the characterization of bi-directional interactions. We also compared the chat interaction patterns with the patterns from phone call datasets to investigate the difference of live communication in different media. The hypothesis of the experiment was that either richness or concurrency of communication is important for organizing social presence. Richness is defined by the variety of information at a time in communication and the concurrency is the number of temporal thread being processed at the same time. Our results show that when we merely increase the richness of information by presenting the typing process, the cognition of others' presence does not significantly increase. However, when the information concurrency is augmented by introducing the transmission of realtime text, we found that the transfer entropy between the interactants becomes considerably higher, and the social presence and emotional arousal, intimacy increased. High transfer entropy was also observed in the phone call dataset. This result shows that the mere augmentation of information richness does not necessarily lead to increased social presence, and concurrent communication is another critical factor for fostering vivid conversation in digital environments.","output":"Analysis and Design of Social Presence in a Computer-Mediated Communication System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted postgraduate training programmes worldwide.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of self-medication reported by parents among children under age 12 in China. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted among parents of children under age 12 in China by using a self-administered online questionnaire. Parents were asked whether they have self-medicated their children in the past 12 months. Logistic regression analysis was performed to access the risk factors of self-medication. RESULTS: Eligible questionnaires were obtained from 4,608 parents. The majority of respondents were mothers aged between 30 and 39 years old who held a college degree.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in suspension of many clinical preventive services, pediatric vaccination rates in the United States have fallen precipitously, dramatically increasing risk of measles resurgence. Previous research has shown that measles outbreaks in high-coverage contexts are driven by spatial clustering of nonvaccination, which decreases local immunity below the herd immunity threshold. However, little is known about how to best conduct surveillance and target interventions to detect and address these high-risk areas, and most vaccination data are reported at the state-level-a resolution too coarse to detect community-level clustering of nonvaccination characteristic of recent outbreaks. In this paper, we perform a series of computational experiments to assess the impact of clustered nonvaccination on outbreak potential and magnitude of bias in predicting disease risk posed by measuring vaccination rates at coarse spatial scales. We find that, when nonvaccination is locally clustered, reporting aggregate data at the state- or county-level can result in substantial underestimates of outbreak risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a bright light on the weaknesses in US infectious disease surveillance and a broader gap in our understanding of how to best use detailed spatial data to interrupt and control infectious disease transmission.

With experimental and theoretical approach, this manuscript discusses the minimum dose received by various parts of the N95 respirator after one complete decontamination cycle with this UVGI unit. The results demonstrate that all parts of the N95 FFR received at least 1 J cm-2 after one complete decontamination cycle with this unit. As there are a variety of UVGI devices and different types of FFRs, this study provides a model by which UVC dose received by different areas of the FFRs can be accurately assessed to ensure proper decontamination for the safety of healthcare providers.","output":"UVC Germicidal Units: Determination of Dose Received and Parameters to be Considered for N95 Respirator Decontamination and Reuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by symptoms of fever and pneumonia, was reported in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 (Phelan, Katz, & Gostin, 2020).

This model predicts COVID-19 deaths and infections based on three insights. First, mortality rates differ significantly by age. Second, heterogeneous social mixing by age during quarantine may result in older adults (higher risk) to have more effectively quarantined conferring lower incidence relative to younger adults (lower risk and disproportionate essential frontline work). Third, deaths and Infection Fatality Rates may more reliably predict incidence relative to reported cases by removing uncertainty introduced from asymptomatic disease, testing availability, and false results. Age stratified IFR and deaths through December 5 were used to projected deaths (99% significance, P-value .002). Sensitivities for IFR, immune durability, and vaccinations were also modeled. By end 2020, 42% of the U.S. population had immunity differing significantly by age with 25-44-year-olds near 80%. A critical mass of immunity in these ages segments conferred herd immunity to other age groups. Herd immunity exists in the context of historic social distancing (quarantine). A significant percent of high-risk individuals remains susceptible and may facilitate another wave if social distancing restrictions are lifted prior to vaccination.

Many other organisms rely instead on RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by a specialized Dicer protein that cleaves viral double-stranded RNA. Whether RNAi also contributes to mammalian antiviral immunity remains controversial. We identified an isoform of Dicer, named antiviral Dicer (aviD), that protects tissue stem cells from RNA viruses-including Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-by dicing viral double-stranded RNA to orchestrate antiviral RNAi.

We discuss mitochondrial contribution to Covid-19 sepsis, specifically the complex interaction of innate immune function, viral replication, hyper-inflammatory state, and HIF-/Sirtuin pathways. METHODS: Articles from PubMed/Medline searches were reviewed using the combination of terms SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, sepsis, mitochondria, aging, and immunometabolism. RESULTS: Evidence indicates that mitochondria in senescent cells may be dysfunctional and unable to keep up with hypermetabolic demands associated with Covid-19 sepsis. Mitochondrial proteins may serve as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) activating innate immunity. Disruption in normal oxidative phosphorylation pathways contributes to elevated ROS which activates sepsis cascade through HIF-/Sirtuin pathway. ViralCmitochondrial interaction may be necessary for replication and increased viral load. Hypoxia and hyper-inflammatory state contribute to increased mortality associated with Covid-19 sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. Modulating Sirtuin activity is emerging as therapeutic agent in sepsis. HIF-, levels of mitochondrial DNA, and other mitochondrial DAMP molecules may also serve as useful biomarker and need to be investigated. These mechanisms should be explored specifically for Covid-19-related sepsis.

Patients with DKD are among the most complex as their care is multifactorial and involves different groups of health care providers. Suboptimal adherence to polypharmacy is frequent and contributes to poor outcomes. As self-management is one of the keys to clinical success, structured medication adherence programs are crucial. The PANDIA-IRIS (patients diabtiques et insuffisants rnaux: un programme interdisciplinaire de soutien  ladhsion thrapeutique) study is based on a routine medication adherence program led by pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to define the impact of the duration of this medication adherence program on long-term adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with DKD. METHODS: This monocentric adherence program consists of short, repeated motivational interviews focused on patients medication behaviors combined with the use of electronic monitors containing patients medications. When patients open the electronic monitor cap to take their medication, the date and hour at each opening are registered. In total, 73 patients are randomized as 1:1 in 2 parallel groups; the adherence program will last 6 months in the first group versus 12 months in the second group. After the intervention phases, patients continue using their electronic monitors for a total of 24 months but without receiving feedback. Electronic monitors and pill counts are used to assess medication adherence. Persistence and implementation will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves and generalized estimating equation multimodeling, respectively. Longitudinal adherence will be presented as the product of persistence and implementation and modelized by generalized estimating equation multimodeling. The evolution of the ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation) and UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) clinical scores based on medication adherence will be analyzed with generalized estimating equation multimodeling. Patients satisfaction with this study will be assessed through qualitative interviews, which will be transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed for the main themes. RESULTS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee (Vaud, Switzerland) in November 2015. Since then, 2 amendments to the protocol have been approved in June 2017 and October 2019. Patients recruitment began in April 2016 and ended in October 2020. This study was introduced to all consecutive eligible patients (n=275). Among them, 73 accepted to participate (26.5%) and 202 (73.5%) refused. Data collection is ongoing and data analysis is planned for 2022.

Dog ownership can improve human well-being. This study aimed to generate a framework of well-being outcomes for dog-related activities in autistic adults and compare it to the framework generated for a general adult population. Thirty-six autistic dog owners (18C74 years old, 18 males) from diverse UK regions were interviewed and transcripts thematically analysed. 16.7% reported that their dogs prevented them from taking their own lives, mainly due to the dog's affection and the need to care for the animal. Close dog-owner interactions (e.g., cuddling, walking, dog's presence) were the most frequent activities improving emotions/moods and life functioning, whereas routine-like activities (e.g., feeding the animal) particularly enhanced life functioning. Well-being worsening was mainly linked to dog behaviour problems, dog poor health/death and obligations to the dog. Despite some negatives associated with ownership, having a dog could improve the well-being of many autistic adults and assist suicide prevention strategies in this high-risk group. The framework was consistent with that generated previously, indicating its robustness and the potential opportunity to focus on dog-related activities rather than the vague concept of ownership when considering the impact of ownership on well-being.","output":"Understanding the impact of dog ownership on autistic adults: implications for mental health and suicide prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 hit in the Spring of 2020, substantial challenges began to emerge for individuals around the world In this empirical piece we examine the impacts of COVID-19 in the sport for development (SFD) context, as it relates to the individual participant, as well as how those individual needs impact the organization itself This case study, explores a hybrid SFD organization, Highway of Hope (HOH) in Kenya, and the actions of local leadership in response to emergent participant needs during the onset of the pandemic Using a case study approach, involving journal responses from program youth participants and local program leadership, along with other field and meeting notes, themes were generated to highlight the most salient challenges and experiences faced by individual participants, as well as the means of addressing those challenges by HOH Participant journals consisted of both positive and negative thematic findings Positive experiences included Family Time, Rest, and Practicing Better Hygiene, while negative experiences revolved around Restriction of Activity, and Difficulty at Home The overall impact on participant lives were expressed in themes such as Socio-emotional, Physical, and Sport-Specific Further, practical implications for grassroots and hybrid SFD programs during times of unprecedented challenge and notable turning points are highlighted","output":"Sport for Development and COVID-19: Responding to Change and Participant Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of physics in particular the topic of differential equations is commonly used in mathematics physics engineering and various other sciences to explain a phenomenon in a system to produce a form of simulation and prediction of a fairly good mathematical equation is needed.

However, little evidence has demonstrated the use of AAC intervention (AACT) in early recovery from people with post-stroke aphasia in in-patient rehabilitation settings for improving these patients communication effectiveness. The pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will explore the effectiveness and feasibility of including AACT in regular SLT for in-patient people with post-stroke aphasia. METHOD: This pilot RCT is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. Both groups receive a 1-h treatment session, including either both AACT and SLT or SLT only for ten consecutive days. We aim to include 22 in-patient participants with post-stroke aphasia in each group. Participants will be assessed at pre- and post-intervention and 2 weeks after intervention. The primary outcomes are the ability of communication measured by the communication of basic needs subtest in the Functional Assessment of Communication Skills for Adult (FACS) and the overall language performance measured by the Chinese Standard Aphasia Battery (ABC). The secondary outcomes include a 10-min conversation, the 10-item Hospital version of the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (SADQH-10), the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL), and a patient and caregiver satisfaction questionnaire.

At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.

The exact mechanism is not fully clarified, and pathogen-to-host interaction studies are warranted to identify biomarkers of exacerbation in the early phase. Only a limited number of international exacerbation cohorts were studied. Here, we have established a local pediatric exacerbation study in Germany consisting of children with asthma or chronic, recurrent bronchitis and analyzed the viriome within the nasopharyngeal swab specimens derived from the entire cohort (n = 141). Interestingly, 41% of exacerbated children had a positive test result for human rhinovirus (HRV)/human enterovirus (HEV), and 14% were positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). HRV was particularly prevalent in asthmatics (56%), wheezers (50%), and atopic (66%) patients. Lymphocytes were decreased in asthmatics and in HRV-infected subjects, and patients allergic to house dust mites were more susceptible to HRV infection. Our study thus confirms HRV infection as a strong biomarker of exacerbated asthma. Further longitudinal studies will show the clinical progress of those children with a history of an RSV or HRV infection. Vaccination strategies and novel treatment guidelines against HRV are urgently needed to protect those high-risk children from a serious course of disease.","output":"Viral Infection and Respiratory Exacerbation in Children: Results from a Local German Pediatric Exacerbation Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Forage oat is an important feed resource in the world. Few studies on the application of different bacterial additives in forage oat silage have been found, which limits the utilization and promotion of oat silage in animal husbandry. In this study, we compared the fermentation quality and in vitro gas production of oat silage treated with four additives (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum F1,LP; Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus XJJ01, LR; Lacticaseibacillus paracasei XJJ02, LC; and Propionibacterium acidipropionici 1.1161, PP). The results show that compared to the CK group (without additives), the LR group had a higher dry matter content, while the LP group showed an improvement in fermentation quality. At the same time, the bacterial community in the LR group was also different from that in other groups. The treatments of PP and LC had no significant effects on fermentation quality, but the in vitro gas production was significantly reduced in the treated oat silage. These results could help us to optimize the utilization of forage oat silage in balanced ruminant diets. ABSTRACT: Bacterial inoculants are considered as a good choice for successful ensiling, playing a key role in improving the silage quality. However, the potential of different bacteria, especially the propionic acid bacteria, in forage oat ensiling is yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation effects of different bacterial additives on the fermentation quality of forage oat silage. Four additives (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum F1, LP; Lacticaseibacillus 0rhamnosus XJJ01, LR; Lacticaseibacillus paracasei XJJ02, LC; and Propionibacterium acidipropionici 1.1161, PP; without additives, CK) were inoculated in forage oat silage, and the fermentation quality and organic compounds were determined after 60 days of ensiling. Notably, LR showed higher dry matter preservation compared to other additives and CK. In addition, LP and LR showed strong lactic acid synthesis capacity, resulting in lower pH compared to other additives and CK. The treatments of PP and LC increased the bacterial diversity in silage, while the bacterial community in the LR group was different from that in other groups. In addition, the PP- and LC-treated oat silage showed significantly lower total in vitro gas production and a lower methane content. These results suggest that LP is more favorable for producing high-quality oat silage than LR, LC, or PP. Both the PP- and LC- treated oat silage may reduce rumen greenhouse gas emissions.","output":"Exploring the Effects of Different Bacteria Additives on Fermentation Quality, Microbial Community and In Vitro Gas Production of Forage Oat Silage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction With concerns about tobacco use being a risk factor for severe disease from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), understanding nicotine and tobacco use patterns is important for preventive efforts. This study aims to understand changes in combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use among U.S. adults. Methods In August 2020, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of adults aged 18 years in the National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6Cmonth use of combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19. Results A total of 1,024 past 6Cmonth cigarette smokers/e-cigarette users were surveyed. Among cigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking and 33% increased cigarette smoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smoking. Among e-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in and 23% reported increasing e-cigarette use. Twenty-six percent of cigarette smokers and 41% of e-cigarette users tried to quit because of COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible cigarettes (AOR=2.37, 95% CI=1.59, 3.55) and e-cigarettes (AOR=3.14, 95% CI=1.73, 5.70). Conclusions Cigarette and e-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-19-related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Some cigarette smokers, especially those reporting higher stress, increased product use.

Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients develop severe illness, and approximately 40% of those with severe illness eventually die, corresponding to more than 2.78 million people. The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 resemble typical sepsis, and severe COVID-19 has been identified as viral sepsis. Progress in sepsis research is important for improving the clinical care of these patients. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis have led to the view that an uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress are core factors. However, in the traditional treatment of sepsis, it is difficult to achieve a balance between the inflammation, pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and patient tolerance, resulting in high mortality of patients with sepsis. In recent years, nanomaterials mediating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the inflammatory response have shown previously unattainable therapeutic effects on sepsis. Despite these advantages, RONS and inflammatory response-based nanomaterials have yet to be extensively adopted as sepsis therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no review has yet discussed the pathogenesis of sepsis and the application of nanomaterials. To help bridge this gap, we discuss the pathogenesis of sepsis related to inflammation and the overproduction RONS, which activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. We also summarize the application of nanomaterials in the treatment of sepsis. As highlighted here, this strategy could synergistically improve the therapeutic efficacy against both RONS and inflammation in sepsis and may prolong survival.

This study explores the impact of COVID-19 on a face-to-face, peer-led psychoeducational intervention for African American ADRD family caregivers, the Senior Companion Program Plus (SCP-Plus), and its subsequent need to pivot during the pandemic. Method: The SCP-Plus was a randomized control trial across three states that assessed program impact on ADRD family caregiver stress/burden, coping, and social support. In spring 2020, the SCP-Plus intervention was halted because of the potential risk to participants due to COVID-19 (n = 20 enrolled dyads). In an effort to maintain rapport and trust, critical to retention in research studies, team members began weekly (March-April) and then bi-weekly calls (May-December) for the purpose of providing a social check-in and to provide updates on the status of the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 396 calls lasting approximately 10 minutes each were completed. Participants shared concerns around safety, access to food/supplies/masks/testing, feelings of stress and loss, concern for others, and the importance of technology as a means of social connection. Although the intervention aspect of the SCP-Plus ultimately ended due to COVID-19, information gleaned from these check-ins were used to pivot the study. The study moved forward by using a descriptive phenomenological approach to capture dyads lived experiences during COVID-19.

To characterize statewide seroprevalence and point prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rhode Island.Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households across Rhode Island in May 2020. Antibody-based and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 were offered. Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans/Blacks were oversampled to ensure adequate representation. Seroprevalence estimations accounted for test sensitivity and specificity and were compared according to age, race/ethnicity, gender, housing environment, and transportation mode.Results. Overall, 1043 individuals from 554 households were tested (1032 antibody tests, 988 PCR tests). The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 2.1% (95% credible interval [CI] = 0.6, 4.1). Seroprevalence was 7.5% (95% CI = 1.3, 17.5) among Hispanics/Latinos, 3.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 15.0) among African Americans/Blacks, and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 2.4) among non-Hispanic Whites.

The disease identification involves manual checking so far, and automation is a current trend in the medical field. Existing methods use a single algorithm for the prediction of diabetes. For complex problems, a single model is not enough because it may not be suitable for the input data or the parameters used in the approach. To solve complex problems, multiple algorithms are used. These multiple algorithms follow a homogeneous model or heterogeneous model. The homogeneous model means the same algorithm, but the model has been used multiple times.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. We also assessed risk factors for inpatient and outpatient status for Covid-19 positive individuals. RESULTS: We found that black participants were at over three times increased risk of testing positive for Covid-19, relative to white participants, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28 to 4.31). Asian participants were also at higher risk of Covid-19 (ARR 2.03, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.95). Next, we analyzed the association of comorbidities with Covid-19.

Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-/) response, which may significantly contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that ORF4b in the cytoplasm could specifically bind to TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IB kinase epsilon (IKK), suppress the molecular interaction between mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and IKK, and inhibit IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and subsequent IFN- production. Further analysis showed that ORF4b could also inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-, whereas deletion of the nuclear localization signal of ORF4b abrogated its ability to inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-, but not IFN- production induced by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK, and TBK-1, suggesting that ORF4b could inhibit the induction of IFN- in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Collectively, these results indicate that MERS-CoV ORF4b inhibits the induction of type I IFN through a direct interaction with IKK/TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism. Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or thwart a hosts antiviral responses. A novel human coronavirus (HCoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is distinguished from other coronaviruses by its high pathogenicity and mortality. However, virulence determinants that distinguish MERS-CoV from other HCoVs have yet to be identified. MERS-CoV ORF4b antagonizes the early antiviral response, which may contribute to MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Here, we report the identification of the interferon (IFN) antagonism mechanism of MERS-CoV ORF4b. MERS-CoV ORF4b inhibits the production of type I IFN through a direct interaction with IKK/TBK1 in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus with unknown mechanism.

The objective of this study was to investigate the nationwide epidemiology of positive blood cultures drawn in ICUs during the first two pandemic waves of COVID-19 in Switzerland. METHODS: We analyzed data on positive blood cultures among ICU patients, prospectively collected through a nationwide surveillance system (ANRESIS), from March 30, 2020, to May 31, 2021, a 14-month timeframe that included a first wave of COVID-19, which affected the French and Italian-speaking regions, an interim period (summer 2020) and a second wave that affected the entire country. We used the number of ICU patient-days provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health as denominator to calculate incidence rates of blood culture contaminations and bloodstream infections (ICU-BSI). Incidence rate ratios comparing the interim period with the second wave were determined by segmented Poisson regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1099 blood culture contaminations and 1616 ICU-BSIs were identified in 52 ICUs during the study. Overall, more episodes of blood culture contaminations and ICU-BSI were observed during the pandemic waves, compared to the interim period. The proportions of blood culture contaminations and ICU-BSI were positively associated with the ICU occupancy rate, which was higher during the COVID-19 waves. During the more representative second wave (versus interim period), we observed an increased incidence of blood culture contaminations (IRR 1.57, 95% CI 1.16C2.12) and ICU-BSI (IRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03C1.39).

Two common classifications of entrepreneurship types are based on professional status and start-up motive, where independent own-account workers are assumed to perform better than dependent self-employed and opportunity entrepreneurs are assumed to perform better than necessity entrepreneurs. However, these supposed performance differentials are seldomly tested or quantified. Using recent data drawn from the European Working Conditions Survey for the EU-28, we explore self-employment earnings (as an indicator of performance) across these different entrepreneurship types. Our results from OLS and multilevel linear regressions show that dependent self-employed workers are indeed observed to have significantly lower earnings than independent own-account workers, but the difference is only 10%, suggesting that the precarious nature of the dependent self-employed may be overstated in certain policy circles. Regarding start-up motive, our paper highlights the importance of distinguishing the group of entrepreneurs who simultaneously have both opportunity and necessity motives to start a business.","output":"Measuring performance differentials across entrepreneurship types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to fake news can result in false memories, with possible consequences for downstream behaviour. Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. In a large, preregistered study (N = 3,746) we measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic, and investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. We report that objectively-assessed knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with fewer false memories and with better discrimination between true and false stories. In contrast, participants who believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for any story, true or false. Individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 were also biased towards remembering any given story, while also showed heightened sensitivity to the difference between true and false stories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer false memories and with a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data suggest that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news, and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individuals knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.","output":"Individual differences in susceptibility to false memories for COVID-19 fake news"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can be mistaken for vaccine-related side effects during initial days after immunization.

Telemedicine has rapidly emerged as a critical technology enabling health care visits to continue while supporting social distancing to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients, families, and clinicians. This model of patient care is being utilized at major cancer centers around the USAand tele-oncology (telemedicine in oncology) has rapidly become the primary method of providing cancer care. However, most clinicians have little experience and inadequate training in this new form of care delivery. Because many practicing oncology clinicians are not familiar with telemedicine technology and the best practices for virtual communication, we strongly believe that training in this field is essential. Utilizing best practices of communication skills training, this paper presents a brief tele-oncology communication guide (Comskil TeleOnc) to address the timely need to maximize high-quality care to patients with cancer. The goal of the Comskil TeleOnc Guide is to recognize, elicit, and effectively respond to patients medical needs and concerns while utilizing empathic responses to communicate understanding, alleviate distress, and provide support via videoconferencing. We recommend five strategies to achieve the communication goal outlined above: (1) Establish the clinician-patient relationship/create rapport, (2) set the agenda, (3) respond empathically to emotions, (4) deliver the information, and (5) effectively end the tele-oncology visit.

METHODS: An online follow-up questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, and coping style was completed by participants 2 months after the end of the quarantine (n = 758). RESULTS: Individuals experienced psychological symptoms also 2 months after the end of the quarantine. No decrease in depression and anxiety scores emerged, but younger individuals and females experienced more severe symptoms. Anger symptoms decreased in young adults, whereas they increased in older adults. Moreover, individuals reported more cognitive failures at follow-up. No changes were observed in resilience, whereas participants reported adopting fewer coping strategies at follow-up. Finally, post-traumatic stress symptoms 2 months after the end of the lockdown were associated with more severe psychological symptoms and more fear of getting infected at baseline.

The patient was treated with gastropexy and Stamm gastrostomy tube. DISCUSSION: Gastric volvulus is a rare phenomenon, in which the stomach rotates around the short (mesentero-axial) or longitudinal (organo-axial) axes. Diagnosis of gastric volvulus is challenging due to non-specific presentation and rarity of this clinical condition. The diagnosis of volvulus in patients with altered anatomy is even more challenging, requiring a high index of suspicion, and heavily relies on cross sectional imaging. CONCLUSION: Extensive gastric mobilization is a key step in several foregut and bariatric surgeries, this will leave the stomach with no attachments posteriorly and along the greater curvature and increases the likelihood of volvulus.","output":"Gastric remnant mesentero-axial volvulus following Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy: A rare complication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated a national lockdown in the UK. The public were advised to avoid unnecessary hospital attendances and health professionals were advised to avoid aerosol-generating procedures wherever possible. The authors hypothesised that these measures would result in a reduction in the number of patients presenting to hospital with acute appendicitis and alter treatment choices. METHODS A multicentred, prospective observational study was undertaken during April 2020 to identify adults treated for acute appendicitis. Searches of operative and radiological records were performed to identify patients treated during April 2018 and April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS A total of 190 patients were treated for acute appendicitis pre-lockdown compared with 64 patients treated during lockdown. Patients treated during the pandemic were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (p = 0.049) and to have delayed their presentation to hospital (2 versus 3 days, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, the use of computed tomography (CT) increased from 36.3% to 85.9% (p < 0.001), the use of an antibiotic-only approach increased from 6.2% to 40.6% (p < 0.001) and the rate of laparoscopic appendicectomy reduced from 85.3% to 17.2% (p < 0.001). The negative appendicectomy rate decreased from 21.7% to 7.1% during lockdown (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis and a significant shift in the management approach. The increased use of CT allows the identification of simple appendicitis for conservative treatment and decreases the negative appendicectomy rate.","output":"Where have all the appendicectomies gone?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention not only on health and social issues, but on the issue of digital transformation as well.

We enrolled 103 recovered COVID-19 patients as well as 27 healthy donors, and performed pulmonary function tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans, laboratory examinations, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma metabolite profiles of COVID-19 survivors with abnormal pulmonary function were evidently different from those of healthy donors or subjects with normal pulmonary function. These alterations were associated with disease severity and mainly involved amino acid, and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Furthermore, increased levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, prostaglandin E2, arginine, and decreased levels of betain and adenosine were associated with pulmonary CO diffusing capacity and total lung capacity.

Interestingly, many of the actions and policies adopted in countries are linked to the social determinants of health (SDH). The SDH are critical determinants of health and health inequalities that are not directly within the health sector. Policies such as social distancing, good hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, cancelling of social and sports events, using personal protective equipment, schools and restaurants closure, country lockdown, etc. are not necessarily within the health sector but have been promoted to prevent and attenuate COVID-19 infection rates significantly. The SDH that serve to reduce morbidity will forestall or substantially reduce the pressure on many weak health systems in developing countries that cannot cope with increased hospitalisation and intensive health care. This paper argues that one of the most critical social determinants of health (i.e. effective crisis and risk communication), is crucial in many developing countries, including those with fewer confirmed coronavirus cases. We note that the effectiveness of many of the other SDH in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on effective communication, especially crisis and risk communication. Although many countries are adopting different communication strategies during the COVID-19 crisis, effective crisis and risk communication will lead to building trust, credibility, honesty, transparency, and accountability. The peculiarity of many developing countries in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity is an essential consideration in ensuring effective crisis and risk communication. Developing countries facing significant poverty and disease burden cannot afford to handle the burgeoning of COVID-19 infections and must take preventive measures seriously. Thus, we submit that there is a need to intensify SDH actions and ensure that no one is left behind when communicating crisis and risk to the population to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Social determinants of health: the role of effective communication in the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine the multiple intelligences possessed by students, the level of multiple intelligences of students and to measure the relationship between multiple intelligences with the learning outcomes of welding practice lectures in the Undergraduate Program of Mechanical Engineering Education, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University The method used is a survey The research was carried out in the Undergraduate Program of Mechanical Engineering Education, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University The research was conducted from April to July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and was conducted online The research subjects were students of the 2018 Undergraduate Program of Mechanical Engineering Education, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University The independent variable is the student's multiple intelligences and the dependent variable is the learning result of welding practice lectures The result of this research shows that the highest multiple intelligences is interpersonal intelligence (78 91%) and the lowest multiple intelligences is naturalist intelligence (63 48%) Other multiple intelligences include verballinguistic intelligence (72 01%), logic-mathematics (72 59%), visual-spatial (71 29%), kinesthetic (72 02%), musical (68 36%), intrapersonal (73 93%) and existential (65 43%) The highest multiple intelligences that became dominant from the students of the S1 Mechanical Engineering Study Program, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University, were interpersonal intelligence with 20 students (25 97%), intrapersonal with 17 students (22 08%), visual-spatial with 8 students (10 39%), logic-mathematics with 7 students (9 09%), musical with 7 students (9 09%), verbal-linguistics with 6 students (7 79%), kinesthetic with 5 students (6 49%), existential with 5 students (6 49%) and naturalists with 2 students (2 60%) The value (Sig ) Is 0 028 1 99897, it can be concluded that there is a contribution of multiple intelligences of students of the S1 Mechanical Engineering Study Program, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University (X) to the learning outcomes of welding practice in the Undergraduate Program of Mechanical Engineering Education, Faculty of Engineering, Yogyakarta State University (Y) ? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"Multiple intelligences in welding practice lectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, taking place globally, occurs as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection which has caused death of innumerable numbers of people and is responsible for a massive drop in the global economy.

Common sources of MSCs include among others, bone marrow (BM), fat, umbilical cord, and placenta-derived decidua stromal cells (DSCs). We here summarize our more than 20-years of scientific experience in the clinical use of MSCs and DSCs in different clinical settings. BM-MSCs were first explored to enhance the engraftment of autografts in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and osteogenesis imperfecta around 30 years ago. In 2004, our group reported the first anti-inflammatory use of BM-MSCs in a child with grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Subsequent studies have shown that MSCs appear to be more effective in acute than chronic GvHD. Today BM-MSC-therapy is registered for acute GvHD in Japan and for GvHD in children in Canada and New Zeeland. MSCs first home to the lung following intravenous injection and exert strong local and systemic immunomodulatory effects on the host immune system. Thus, they were studied for ameliorating the cytokine storm in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both, MSCs and DSCs were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced ARDS. In addition, they were also used for other novel indications, such as pneumomediastinum, colon perforation, and radiculomyelopathy. MSC and DSCs trigger coagulation and were thus explored to stop hemorrhages. DSCs appear to be more effective for acute GvHD, ARDS, and hemorrhages, but randomized studies are needed to prove superiority. Stromal cell infusion is safe, well tolerated, and only gives rise to a slight fever in a limited number of patients, but no major side effects have been reported in multiple safety studies and metaanalysis. In this review we summarize current evidence from in vitro studies, animal models, and importantly our clinical experience, to support stromal cell therapy in multiple clinical indications. This encloses MSCs effects on the immune system, coagulation, and their safety and efficacy, which are discussed in relation to prominent clinical trials within the field.","output":"Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Enhancing Hematopoietic Engraftment and Treatment of Graft-Versus-Host Disease, Hemorrhages and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare skin reaction, commonly caused by drugs.

Febrile response is mediated by endogenous pyrogens (cytokines) in response to invading exogenous pyrogens, primarily microorganisms or their direct products (toxins). ? These endogenous pyrogens act on thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus, which ultimately upgrade the set point via prostaglandins. ? The body reacts by increasing the heat production and decreasing the heat loss until the body temperature reaches this elevated set point. ? Fever, in contrast to hyperthermia, will not climb up relentlessly because of an effective central control of the hypothalamic center. ? Cytokines play a pivotal role in the immune response by activation of the B cells and T lymphocytes. The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favor of the protective role of fever. ? The protective processes of the immune response are optimal at high temperature (around 39.5C). ? Not all effects resulting from fever generation benefit the host; some are harmful and even lethal.

METHODS Sixty-one cases of SARS with positive antibodies to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were classified into the following categories: initial stage (3 - 7 days), peak stage (8 - 14 days), and remission and recovery stage (15 - 27 days). Forty-four healthy individuals were used as controls. Serum levels of ILs, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 were measured in all subjects. Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected only in SARS cases. RESULTS The mean concentration of serum IL-6 in SARS patients did not differ from that in the control group in initial and peak stages, but became significantly higher in remission and recovery stage compared with the control group, initial and peak stages (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of serum IL-8 in SARS patients did not differ from that of the control group in initial stage, but was significantly higher than control group in peak stage and remission and recovery stage (P < 0.05). And it was more significantly higher in remission and recovery stage than in peak stage (P < 0.01). The mean concentrations of IL-16 and TNF-alpha in SARS patients were higher than those of the control group for every length of the clinical courses investigated, and were especially high in remission and recovery stage (P < 0.01). SARS patients experienced higher concentration of serum IL-13 compared with the controls in initial stage (P < 0.01), but returned to normal levels in peak stage and in remission and recovery stage. The mean concentration of serum IL-18 in SARS patients was significantly lower than that of the control group during all clinical courses (P < 0.05). The mean concentration of serum TGF-beta1 in SARS patients was higher than that of the control group during all clinical courses. Although TGF-beta1 in serum decreased in remission and recovery stage in SARS patients, the average was still higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Most proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta 1 were elevated during the early phase of SARS, which may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation. Concurrently, the mean concentration of serum IL-13 decreased gradually, and the mean concentration of serum IL-18 level in SARS patients was lower than that of the control group during all the courses of SARS, suggesting that the immune state of the patients with SARS was obviously abnormal.

Finally, we propose a data-driven rolling horizon procedure to facilitate decision-making in real-time, which mitigates some critical limitations of stochastic programming approaches and makes the resulting strategies implementable in practice. We use two different case studies related to COVID-19 to examine our optimization and simulation tools by extensive computational results.

Among them, the control group was treated with radiotherapy, while the experimental group was treated with radiotherapy combined with capecitabine. The therapeutic efficacy, CEA levels, the incidence and recurrence rate of adverse reactions, as well as the progression-free survival and survival rate after 2-year treatment were analyzed in the two groups. RESULTS: The effective rate of treatment in the experimental group of 87.5% (35/40) was significantly higher than 50% (20/40) in the control group, with statistical significance (X(2) = 13.09, P < 0.001).

Most LET procedures result in a construct that is fixed to both the femur and the tibia. In a modified Ellison procedure, the construct is only fixed distally, reducing the risk of inadvertently overconstraining the lateral compartment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of the modified Ellison procedure in a cohort of patients deemed to be at a high risk of further ACL injury after primary ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Included were 25 consecutive patients with at least 2 of the following risk factors: age <20 years at the time of surgery, previous contralateral ACL reconstruction, positive family history of ACL rupture (parent or sibling), generalized ligamentous laxity (Beighton 4), grade 3 pivot shift in the consulting room, a desire to return to a pivoting sport, and an elite or professional status. All patients underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an additional modified Ellison procedure. Postoperatively, patients completed the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form (International Knee Documentation Committee), KOOS Quality of Life subscale (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), ACLCReturn to Sport After Injury Scale, Marx Activity Rating Scale, and SANE score (Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation). RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, the mean outcome scores were as follows: SANE, 94/100; IKDC, 92/100; Marx, 13/16; ACLCReturn to Sport, 85/100; and KOOS, 77/100. At 24 months, return-to-sport data were available for 23 of 25 patients; 17 (74%) were playing at the same level or higher than preinjury and 2 at a lower level. One patient (4%) sustained a contact mechanism graft rupture at 12 months. There were 2 (9%) contralateral ACL injuries, including 1 ACL graft rupture, at 11 and 22 months postoperatively. There was a further contralateral ACL graft rupture at 26 months. CONCLUSION: The use of the modified Ellison procedure as a LET augmentation of a primary ACL reconstruction to produce a low graft rupture rate appeared to be safe in a cohort considered to be at a high risk of reinjury.

This is exemplified by the recent COVID-19 outbreak which has had a significant impact on both personnel health and normal operations of the assets. The occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases on marine and offshore assets can, however, be mitigated by appropriate physical arrangements on board and having operational procedures in place. This paper addresses the former. The effectiveness of operational measures can be significantly increased if infectious diseases are considered at the assets design stage. ABS has identified a lack of available technical guidance regarding physical arrangements that can help make marine and offshore assets safer for crews and reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVD-19. This paper presents the best practices and recommendations for physical arrangements drawn mainly from the recognized standards for land-based medical facilities and applied to marine and offshore assets. The recommendations focus on specific spaces inside the accommodation block, their number, location, layout, ventilation, and interior surfaces. Isolation cabins with their associated anterooms are proposed as the most reliable way of isolating suspected or confirmed cases of an infectious disease from the rest of the personnel on board. Negative pressure, independent exhaust system, and easy to clean surfaces that are accessible and resistant to deterioration from frequent cleaning and disinfection are effective measures in containing the transmission of infectious diseases that are spread through the air or direct and indirect contact. The paper also emphasizes the need to promote segregation of the visitors from crew and passengers by providing designated spaces for the visitors and gives recommendations on the communication equipment needed for receiving medical advice from land-based medical specialists. If properly implemented and if augmented with robust operational measures, physical arrangement measures have the potential to significantly improve the safety of the crew, passengers, and visitors, as well as minimize the negative consequences of disruptions to normal asset operations. ?

In response, telerehabilitation (TR) has emerged as alternative care model. Aims were: (1) describe baseline patient characteristics and available unadjusted outcomes for episodes of care administered during COVID-19 using TR vs. traditional in-person care, (2) describe TR frequency levels by condition and telecommunication modes. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective observational design was used to report patient variables and outcomes including physical function, number of visits, and patient satisfaction, by TR frequency (few, most, or all visits) and telecommunication modes. Standardized differences were used to compare baseline characteristics between episodes with and without TR. RESULTS: Sample consisted of 222,680 patients [59% female; mean age (SD) = 55(18)]. Overall TR rate was 6% decreasing from 10% to 5% between 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2020. Outcome measures were available for 90% to 100% of episodes. Thirty-seven percent of clinicians administered care via TR. Patients treated using TR compared to in-person care were more likely to be younger, and live in large metropolitan areas. From those with TR, 55%, 20%, and 25% had TR during few, most, or all visits, respectively. TR care was administered equally across orthopedic body parts, with lower use for non-orthopedic conditions such as stroke, edema, and vestibular dysfunction. TR was primarily administered using synchronous (video or audio) modes. The rate of patients reported being very satisfied with their treatment results was 3% higher for no TR compared to TR. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new knowledge about to whom and how TR is being administered during the pandemic in outpatient rehabilitation practices throughout the USA. The database assessed was found to be suitable for conducting studies on associations between TR and diverse outcome measures, controlling for a comprehensive set of patient characteristics, to advance best TR care models, and promote high quality care. IMPACT: This study provided detailed and robust descriptive information using an existing national patient database containing patient health and demographic characteristics, outcome measures, and TR administration data. Findings support the feasibility to conduct future studies on associations between TR care and patient outcomes, adjusting for a wide range of patient characteristics and clinical setting factors that may be associated with the probability of receiving TR. Finding of limited and decreasing use of TR over the study period calls for studies aimed to better understand facilitators and inhibitors of TR use by rehabilitation therapists during everyday practice to promote its use when clinically appropriate.","output":"Telerehabilitation During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Outpatient Rehabilitation Settings: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute psychological stress is commonly experienced by university students as they transition through a new learning environment; however, uncontrolled and long-term stress, such as that experienced due to the global respiratory pandemic, contributes to a severe decline in the physical and mental health of nursing students and decreases their academic success.

To eliminate the direct observation, we investigated the effectiveness of an end-to-end framework that works with the data from a single wearable sensor. The framework is used to identify the performed task as the major contextual risk factor, and then estimate the task duration and number of repetitions as two main indicators of task intensity. For evaluation of the framework, we recruited 37 participants to complete 10 simulated work tasks in a laboratory setting. In testing, we achieved an average accuracy of 92% for task identification, 7.3% error in estimation of task duration, and 7.1% error for counting the number of task repetitions. Moreover, we showed the utility of the framework outputs in two ergonomic tools to estimate the risk of injury.

Despite the potential correlation of these outcomes, they are typically analysed separately, potentially leading to misinformation and inefficient estimates due to partial assessment of safety data. Using joint modelling, we investigated whether clinical AEs vary by treatment and how laboratory outcomes (alanine amino-transferase, total bilirubin) and concomitant medication are associated with clinical AEs over time following artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy. METHODS: We used data from a trial of artemisinin-based treatments for malaria during pregnancy that randomized 870 women to receive artemetherClumefantrine (AL), amodiaquineCartesunate (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisininCpiperaquine (DHAPQ). We fitted a joint model containing four sub-models from four outcomes: longitudinal sub-model for alanine aminotransferase, longitudinal sub-model for total bilirubin, Poisson sub-model for concomitant medication and Poisson sub-model for clinical AEs. Since the clinical AEs was our primary outcome, the longitudinal sub-models and concomitant medication sub-model were linked to the clinical AEs sub-model via current value and random effects association structures respectively. We fitted a conventional Poisson model for clinical AEs to assess if the effect of treatment on clinical AEs (i.e. incidence rate ratio (IRR)) estimates differed between the conventional Poisson and the joint models, where AL was reference treatment. RESULTS: Out of the 870 women, 564 (65%) experienced at least one AE. Using joint model, AEs were associated with the concomitant medication (log IRR 1.7487; 95% CI: 1.5471, 1.9503; p < 0.001) but not the total bilirubin (log IRR: -0.0288; 95% CI: ? 0.5045, 0.4469; p = 0.906) and alanine aminotransferase (log IRR: 0.1153; 95% CI: ? 0.0889, 0.3194; p = 0.269). The Poisson model underestimated the effects of treatment on AE incidence such that log IRR for ASAQ was 0.2118 (95% CI: 0.0082, 0.4154; p = 0.041) for joint model compared to 0.1838 (95% CI: 0.0574, 0.3102; p = 0.004) for Poisson model. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that although the AEs did not vary across the treatments, the joint model yielded efficient AE incidence estimates compared to the Poisson model.

We hypothesize a consequence of COVID-19 is reduced operative volume across the country. We aim to examine changes in volume of common gastrointestinal operations during COVID-19, including elective, urgent/emergent, and cancer operations. We also evaluate if hospitals with more COVID-19 admissions were most impacted. METHODS: The Vizient database was used to determine monthly operative volume from November 2019 to June 2020 for elective operations (hiatal hernia repairs, bariatric surgery), urgent operations (cholecystectomies, appendectomies, inguinal hernia repairs), and cancer operations (colectomies, gastrectomies, esophagectomies). COVID-19 admissions per hospital were also determined. November 2019-January 2020 was defined as \\"pre-COVID.\\" The monthly reduction in volume from pre-COVID was calculated for each operation. The top quartile (25%) of hospitals with the most COVID admissions were also evaluated separately from hospitals with fewer COVID cases. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Data from 559 hospitals were analyzed. The volumes of all operations evaluated were significantly reduced during the pandemic except gastrectomies and esophagectomies for cancer. The greatest reduction in all operations was in April. In April, the volume of bariatric surgery reduced by 98% (P < 0.001), hiatal hernia repairs by 96% (P < 0.001), urgent cholecystectomies by 42% (P < 0.001), urgent inguinal hernia repairs by 40% (P < 0.001), urgent appendectomies by 24% (P < 0.001), and colectomies for cancer by 39% (P < 0.001). Hospitals with the most COVID-19 admissions had greater reductions in all operations than hospitals with fewer COVID cases. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus pandemic led to a significant reduction in volume of all gastrointestinal operations evaluated except gastrectomies and esophagectomies. While elective, non-cancer operations were most affected, urgent and some cancer operations also declined significantly.

Antigenicity was compared by detection of polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) against the virus and S protein using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a serum cross-neutralization (SN) assay. Reactivity with the PAbs revealed significant cross-reactivity between the two PEDV subtypes, although there was a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on PAb titers in the ELISA and IFA. Consistent with the variation in the S gene sequences, the SN titer suggested differences in the neutralization activity of the S protein between the two subtypes, which could explain the antigenic variation between the PEDV subtypes G1 and G2.","output":"Immunogenicity and antigenic relationships among spike proteins of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus subtypes G1 and G2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: To provide an overview of current literature on the pathophysiology of sepsis, with a focus on mediators of endothelial injury and organ dysfunction. SUMMARY: Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that triggers cascades of interconnected systems. Sepsis has been a significant cause of mortality worldwide, and the recent viral pandemic that may produce severe sepsis and septic shock has been a major contributor to sepsis-related mortality. Understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has changed dramatically over the last several decades. Significant insight into the components of the inflammatory response that contribute to endothelial injury and trigger coagulation pathways has been achieved. Similarly, characterization of anti-inflammatory pathways that may lead to secondary infections and poor outcome has illustrated opportunities for improved therapies. Description of an increasing number of important mediators and pathways has occurred and may point the way to novel therapies to address immune dysregulation. Pharmacists will need a fundamental understanding of the overlapping pathways of the immune response to fully prepare for use of novel treatment options. While pharmacists typically understand coagulation cascade how to utilize anticoagulants, the issues in sepsis related coagulopathy and role of mediators such as cytokines and complement and role of activated platelets and neutrophils require a different perspective. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists can benefit from understanding both the cellular and organ system issues in sepsis to facilitate assessment of potential therapies for risk and benefit.","output":"The pathophysiology of sepsis2021 update: Part 1, immunology and coagulopathy leading to endothelial injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"eHealth programs have been found to be effective in treating many psychological conditions.

The therapeutic alliance is an important factor predicting treatment outcome in BPD. However, we do not know yet to what extent BPD patients form a therapeutic alliance with an eHealth tool and how this relationship differs from the relationship with their human therapist. This study aims to address this question using priovi, an interactive schema therapy-based eHealth tool for BPD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how patients perceived the therapeutic alliance with priovi and its differences compared to the alliance with their human therapist (N = 9). Interview data were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) was administered in two versions (regarding the human therapist and priovi, N = 16) every three months during the treatment phase of one year. Results indicate that patients were able to form a good therapeutic relationship with priovi, but it differed from the relationship to their human therapist. Important categories were \\"priovi is helpful, supportive and always there\\" and \\"priovi is less flexible\\". WAI ratings for the task subscale were high in both relationships but significantly higher in WAItherapist compared to WAIpriovi in two measurements (nine-months measurement: t = 2.76, df = 15, p = 0.015; twelve-months measurement: t = 3.44, df = 15, p = 0.004).

This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment.

Our objectives were to describe, through electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the impact of PP on global and regional ventilation, and optimal PEEP level. METHODS: A monocentric study conducted on ECMO-supported severe ARDS patients, ventilated in pressure-controlled mode, with 14-cmH(2)O driving pressure and EIT-based optimal PEEP. Before, during and after a 16-h PP session, EIT-based distribution and variation of tidal impedance, VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio, end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and static compliance were collected. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who increased their static compliance by  3 mL/cmH(2)O after 16 h of PP. RESULTS: For all patients (n = 21), tidal volume and EELI were redistributed from ventral to dorsal regions during PP. EIT-based optimal PEEP was significantly lower in PP than in supine position. Median (IQR) optimal PEEP decreased from 14 (12C16) to 10 (8C14) cmH(2)O. Thirteen (62%) patients increased their static compliance by  3 mL/cmH(2)O after PP on ECMO. This subgroup had higher body mass index, more frequent viral pneumonia, shorter ECMO duration, and lower baseline VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio than patients with compliance  3 mL/cmH(2)O (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although baseline tidal volume distribution on EIT may predict static compliance improvement after PP on ECMO, our results support physiological benefits of PP in all ECMO patients, by modifying lung mechanics and potentially reducing VILI.

Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies and extracted data on efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory agents used therapeutically in SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage of disease. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with validated tools. RESULTS: Of the 26 959 records, 520 articles were eligible for inclusion. Studies were mainly at high or unclear RoB. New randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on tocilizumab clarified its benefit in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, mainly if associated with glucocorticoids. There are emergent data on the usefulness of baricitinib and tofacitinib in severe COVID-19.

Molecular docking is one of the methods used to analyze antiviral compounds and their molecular target from Indonesian herbs believed to have properties as anti-COVID-19. This study aims to analyze antiviral compounds from 5 herbs potent inhibitors of PLpro and 3CLpro, both non-structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2, using a molecular docking approach using PLANTS. Remdesivir triphosphate, the active metabolite of Remdesivir, was used as the comparison compound in studies. The results showed docking scores obtained from interactions between natural ligands, Remdesivir triphosphate, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, luteolin, apigenin, quarcetin, kaempferol, formononrtin-7-O-glucoronide, androgafolide, and neoandrogafolide with PLpro are as follows -111,441, -103,827, -103,609, -102,363, -100,27,-79,6655, -78.6901, -80.9337, -79.4686, -82.1124, -79.1789, and -97.2452. The combination of quercetin, neoandrographolide, bisdemethoxycurcumin, demetoxycurcumin, and curcumin showed a synergy effect by reducing its docking score. Meanwhile, its interaction with the protein 3CLpro showed docking score for those compounds as follows 64.0074, -86.1811, -81.428, -87.1625, -78.2899, -73.4345,-70,3368, -71.5539, -68.4321, -72.0154, -75.9777 and -93.7746.

Moreover, restaurant/music/product/movie/news/app recommendations are only a few of the applications of a recommender system. A small percent improvement on the CTR prediction accuracy has been mentioned to add millions of dollars of revenue to the advertisement industry. Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction is a special version of recommender system in which the goal is predicting whether or not a user is going to click on a recommended item. A content-based recommendation approach takes into account the past history of the user's behavior, i.e. the recommended products and the users reaction to them. So, a personalized model that recommends the right item to the right user at the right time is the key to building such a model. On the other hand, the so-called collaborative filtering approach incorporates the click history of the users who are very similar to a particular user, thereby helping the recommender to come up with a more confident prediction for that particular user by leveraging the wider knowledge of users who share their taste in a connected network of users. In this project, we are interested in building a CTR predictor using Graph Neural Networks complemented by an online learning algorithm that models such dynamic interactions. By framing the problem as a binary classification task, we have evaluated this system both on the offline models (GNN, Deep Factorization Machines) with test-AUC of 0.7417 and on the online learning model with test-AUC of 0.7585 using a sub-sampled version of Criteo public dataset consisting of 10,000 data points.","output":"Click-Through Rate Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks and Online Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A common effect of disease is disruption to serum electrolyte levels Diseases responsible for this manifestation can be non-communicable or infectious All aspects of patient care have been impacted by the (COVID-19) disease, occur due to infection with virus of SARS-CoV-2 Early studies of hospitalised COVID-19 patients report a putative relationship between the severity of infection and serum electrolytes, indicating these are potential diagnostic biomarkers of COVID-19 infection Monitoring serum electrolytes as biomarkers of disease can assist with early diagnosis of COVID-19, as low or elevated concentrations of serum various electrolytes are associated with various inflammatory diseases This study explores the effectiveness of using serum electrolytes as biomarkers for COVID-19 detection and clinically management of COVID-19 infected patients Evaluation of efficacy of the method is determined by using a control group for comparison The results reveal significant differences in the blood biochemical parameters among both study categories The blood biochemistry picture of COVID-19 infected individuals is summarised Methods: A total of 100 fully confirmed COVID-19 infected subjects that attending to specialist laboratory during the period from August 2020 to September-2020 were included in this study and evaluated for their serum level of biochemical biomarker (Mg, P, Ca, Na, Cl, K) Results: Of all the Covid-19 patients evaluated, we found that chloride (Cl) and magnesium (Mg) were respectively elevated in 20% and 15% of patients Five per cent of patients had abnormal levels of phosphorus (P) and 73% of patients had reduced serum calcium (Ca), though it was increased in 1% of patients Serum levels of potassium (K) were elevated in 37%, while 19% of patients had abnormal levels of sodium (Na) Conclusions: The range of serum electrolyte abnormalities exhibited by some COVID-19 patients might indicate varying degrees of organ dysfunction The severity of the disease may be reflected to an extent in abnormal biochemical readings of (Ca) and (Na), for example The results of this study indicate that serum concentrations of electrolytes have clinical implications for the management of COVID-19 patient;therefore, to help provide the most appropriate care for these patients, blood tests should be performed to evaluate these biomarkers ? 2020, Advanced Scientific Research All rights reserved","output":"Biochemical biomarker disorder potential to identify COVID-19 patients in Iraq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to indirectly impact transmission dynamics and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI).

Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-19-related sexual distancing and service interruption within 4 service categories (HIV screening, preexposure prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy, and STI treatment). RESULTS: A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM, -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23 800 cases).

Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area.

METHODS: A convenience sampling cross-sectional serology study was conducted (October 2020 to June 2021) in households (N = 20) containing a child with MtD (N = 22). Samples (N = 83) were collected in the home using a microsampling apparatus and shipped to investigators. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (IgG), spike protein (IgG, IgM, IgA), and receptor binding domain (IgG, IgM, IgA) were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: While only 4.8% of participants were clinically diagnosed for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 75.9% of study participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Most samples were IgM positive for spike or RBD (70%), indicating that infection was recent. This translated to all 20 families showing evidence of infection in at least one household member.

Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1 , 5 percent of the population, and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4 M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100 k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak.

Absence of obstructive CAD was associated with insular cortex lesions, no clinical symptoms for ACS, less than three cardiovascular risk factors, younger age and normal wall motion. CONCLUSION Several variables suggest absence of CAD in AIS patients and may help in clinical decision making in stroke patients with myocardial injury.","output":"Coronary angiography in acute ischemic stroke patients: frequency and determinants of pathological findings in a multicenter cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally and has severely impacted public health and the economy. Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission. Effective wastewater treatment methods with high virus removal capacity and low treatment costs should be selected to control the virus spread and safeguard society from this deadly virus.","output":"Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater: Concerns and tactics for treatment to effectively control the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A limited number of pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported since the emergence of the pandemic The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children remain unclear The aim of this review article is to describe the current knowledge of COVID-19 in children regarding its prevalence, signs, symptoms, severity and the role of children in disease transmission This article is based on a comprehensive review of PUbMED and Google Scholar for original articles, letters to editors, editorials, and case reports published from January to October 2020 It was concluded that Children of all age groups are susceptible to acquiring COVID-19 but will most likely be asymptomatic or with mild symptoms Many explanations for this have been suggested, but the exact reason is not clear Although children may show typical symptoms such as fever and cough, yet gastrointestinal involvement is much more common than in adults Dry coughing is also lighter in children There is no significant difference in prevalence between both sexes Regarding transmission, it has not been confirmed whether COVID-19 is often transmitted from children to adults, but it is wise for families and their COVID-19 affected children to follow preventive measures to help stop COVID-19 from spreading","output":"COVID-19 in Children: Prevalence, Clinical Characteristics, Severity, and Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Soft, skin-integrated electronic sensors can provide continuous measurements of diverse physiological parameters, with broad relevance to the future of human health care.

Numerous studies have revealed the growing implementation of novel engineered systems during the intervention at various points of the diseases pathogenesis, especially as it relates to comorbidities and complications related to cardiovascular and respiratory organ systems. In this review, we provide a succinct, but extensive, review of the pathogenesis of COVID-19, particularly as it relates to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a viral entry point. This is followed by a comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities of COVID-19 and novel technologies that are used to diagnose and manage hospitalized patients. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring systems, novel machine learning algorithms for rapidly triaging patients, various imaging modalities, wearable immunosensors, hotspot tracking systems, and other emerging technologies are reviewed. COVID-19 effects on the immune system, associated inflammatory biomarkers, and innovative therapies are also assessed. Finally, with emphasis on the impact of wearable and non-wearable systems, this review highlights future technologies that could help diagnose, monitor, and mitigate disease progression.

Although several vaccines have been deployed, there are few alternative anti-viral treatments available in the case of reduced or non-existent vaccine protection. Adopting a long-term holistic approach to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic appears critical with the emergence of novel and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our objective was to identify comorbidity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), potentially conferring increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a computational meta-analysis approach. SNP datasets were downloaded from a publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog for 141 of 258 candidate COVID-19 comorbidities. Gene-level SNP analysis was performed to identify significant pathways by using the program MAGMA. An SNP annotation program was used to analyze MAGMA-identified genes. Differential gene expression was determined for significant genes across 30 general tissue types using the Functional and Annotation Mapping of GWAS online tool GENE2FUNC. COVID-19 comorbidities (n = 22) from six disease categories were found to have significant associated pathways, validated by QCQ plots (p < 0.05). ProteinCprotein interactions of significant (p < 0.05) differentially expressed genes were visualized with the STRING program.

A transversal study was carried out on a sample comprising 509 men and 396 women aged between 26 and 35 years old. The results showed that there were no differences between the men and women in the number of work-related events and changes experienced in the last 12 months, nor in terms of job satisfaction. The results from the multiple regression analysis showed that a greater number of work-related events and changes experienced during the last 12 months were associated with increased psychological distress and reduced life satisfaction amongst men, but this was not the case for women. Although job satisfaction was independent from the men and womens psychological distress when self-esteem and social support was included in the regression equation, greater job satisfaction was associated with greater life satisfaction for both men and women. It concludes that work-related events and job satisfaction are important for the health and well-being of young people, even though a larger number of work-related events and changes is associated with increased psychological distress and reduced life satisfaction for men only.","output":"The Importance of Work-Related Events and Changes in Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction amongst Young Workers in Spain: A Gender Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic Campylobacter speciesmainly C. jejuni and C. coliare major causes of food-borne bacterial infectious gastroenteritis worldwide.

Moreover, in immunocompromised individuals, systemic spread of the pathogens may trigger diseases of the circulatory system and septicemia. The socioeconomic costs associated with Campylobacter infections have been calculated to several billion dollars annually. Poultry meat products represent major sources of human infections. Thus, a One WorldOne Health approach with collective efforts of public health authorities, veterinarians, clinicians, researchers and politicians is required to reduce the burden of campylobacteriosis. Innovative intervention regimes for the prevention of Campylobacter contaminations along the food chain include improvements of information distribution to strengthen hygiene measures for agricultural remediation.

Here we used bipartite networks to quantitatively and visually analyze heterogeneity in the comorbidity profiles of COVID-19 inpatients, based on electronic health records from 12 hospitals and 60 clinics in the greater Minneapolis region. This approach enabled the analysis and interpretation of heterogeneity at three levels of granularity (cohort, subgroup, and patient), each of which enabled clinicians to rapidly translate the results into the design of clinical interventions.

COVID-19 is an age-related disease with a higher risk of organ dysfunction and mortality in older adults. Coagulation disorders and thrombosis are important pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 infection. Up to 95% of COVID-19 patients have coagulation disorders characterized by an elevated D-dimer, a prolonged prothrombin time, a low platelet count and other laboratory abnormalities. Thrombosis is found in critical cases with an increased risk of death. Endothelial cells are prone to be affected by the novel SARS-CoV-2 and express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The evidence, such as the presence of the virus, has been identified, leading to the inflammation and dysfunction. Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction play a pivotal role in the hypercoagulation status in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the direct exposure of subendothelial tissue to blood, Weibel-Palade bodies within the endothelium containing coagulants can be released into the circulation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may be impaired, thus facilitating platelet adhesion. Moreover, anti-2-glycoprotein I antibodies may also contribute to the coagulopathy in COVID-19 by inducing the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. To conclude, coagulation disorders and thrombosis are vital and predict a poor outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction may play an important role in causing clot formation.

Methods: Data of clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary pathological results were retrospectively reviewed in a case of COVID-19 with rapid exacerbation from mild to critical condition. Results: This patient hospitalized at day 9 post 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection, experienced progressive deterioration from mild to severe at day 11, severe to critical at day 18 and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT) as well as heart lung transplantation during day 28-45 day post infection, and died on the second day post heart and lung transplantation. The patient had suffered from hypertension for 8 years. At the early stage of the disease, his symptoms were mild and the inflammatory indices increased and the lymphocyte count decreased continuously. The patient's condition exacerbated rapidly with multi-organ infections, and eventually developed pulmonary hemorrhage and consolidation, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, liver dysfunction, etc. His clinical manifestations could not be improved despite viral RNAs test results became negative. The patient underwent lung and heart transplantation and finally died of multi organ failure at the second day post lung and heart transplantation.

Altogether 36 articles regarding SARS-CoV-2 associated neuropathy of cranial nerves describing 56 patients were retrieved as per the end of January 2021. Out of these 56 patients, cranial nerves were compromised without the involvement of peripheral nerves in 32 of the patients, while Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with cranial nerve involvement was described in 24 patients. A single cranial nerve was involved either unilaterally or bilaterally in 36 patients, while in 19 patients multiple cranial nerves were involved. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent in the GBS group (n = 11) as compared to the cohort with isolated cranial nerve involvement (n = 5). Treatment of cranial nerve neuropathy included steroids (n = 18), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (n = 18), acyclovir/valacyclovir (n = 3), and plasma exchange (n = 1).

The involvement of cranial nerves in COVID-19 may or may not be associated with GBS. In patients with cranial nerve involvement, COVID-19 infections are usually mild. Isolated cranial nerve palsy without GBS usually responds favorably to steroids.

Patients with hematological cancers are regarded as a high-risk group for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, few reports have investigated factors that might account for the differential severity of COVID-19 disease in these patients. METHODS: Gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry-promoting factors and entry-restricting factors and the associated effects on myeloid malignancies were evaluated. Gene expression levels of 11 SARS-CoV-2 entry-promoting factors and 4 SARS-CoV-2 entry-restricting factors were analyzed in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia and its subtypes. RESULTS: Expression levels of promoting and restricting factors were most affected in MDS. Specifically, 4 of the 11 analyzed SARS-CoV-2 entry-promoting factors were significantly increased (TMPRSS4, CD209, CLEC4G, and CTSB), and 2 of the 4 analyzed SARS-CoV-2 entry-restricting factors were significantly decreased (IFITM1 and IFITM2) in MDS. Patients with CML also exhibited a pattern of significant changes in SARS-CoV-2 entry-promoting and entry-restricting factors. Five of the 11 analyzed SARS-CoV-2 entry-promoting factors were significantly increased (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, ANPEP, CD209), and 1 of the 4 analyzed SARS-CoV-2 entry-restricting factors was significantly decreased (LY6E) in CML.

Consequently, novel and efficacious treatment approaches are highly warranted. Based on our experiences with concentrated treatment formats for other health challenges, we developed a highly concentrated interdisciplinary group rehabilitation approach for chronic illnesses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the acceptability of the intervention and describe potential changes in functional impairment at follow-up. METHODS: The cornerstones of the intervention are as follows: (1) prepare the patient for change prior to treatment, (2) focus on health promoting microchoices instead of symptoms, and (3) expect the patient to integrate the changes in everyday living with limited hands-on follow-up. The intervention will be delivered to patients with highly diverse primary symptoms, namely patients with low back pain, postCCOVID-19 symptoms, anxiety and depression, and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Recruitment started between August 2020 and January 2021 (according to the illness category). For initial 3-month results, recruitment is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, this study may have a substantial impact on the treatment of low back pain, postCCOVID-19 symptoms, anxiety and depression, and type 2 diabetes, which together constitute a major socioeconomic cost.

We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids. Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomew's Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period. Results: In total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1  3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3  2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7  9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6  9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6  15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2  25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients.

Renal resistive index (RRI) is a noninvasive instrument to evaluate kidney hemodynamics, and it is obtained by analysis of intrarenal arterial waves using Doppler ultrasound. This study aimed to determine the role of RRI in predicting AKI and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 65 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit from April 1, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Cardiac, pulmonary, and kidney ultrasonographic evaluations were performed in a protocolized way. RESULTS: In this cohort, 65 patients were included, mean age was 53.4 years, 79% were male, and 35% were diabetic. Thirty-four percent of patients developed AKI, 12% required RRT, and 35% died. Of the patients who developed AKI, 68% had RRI  0.7. Also, 75% of the patients who required RRT had RRI  0.7. In the adjusted Cox model, the RRI  0.7 was associated with higher mortality (HR 2.86, 95% CI: 1.19C6.82, p = 0.01).

This variability has been treated as an unavoidable nuisance inherent to infant research. Here we asked whether the variability contains signal in addition to noise: namely, whether some infants show consistently stronger responses to expectancy violations than others. Infants watched two unrelated physical events 6 mo apart; these events culminated in either an impossible or an expected outcome. We found that infants who exhibited the strongest looking response to an impossible event at 11 mo also exhibited the strongest response to an entirely different impossible event at 17 mo. Furthermore, violation-of-expectation responses in infancy predicted childrens explanation-based curiosity at 3 y old. In contrast, there was no longitudinal relation between infants responses to events with expected outcomes at 11 and 17 mo, nor any link with later curiosity; hence, infants responses do not merely reflect individual differences in attention but are specific to expectancy violations.

In many aspects, GI endoscopy has led the field of nonsurgical interventional medicine. In many aspects, this growth is facilitated by advancements in sedation-both drugs and techniques. Unfortunately, the topic of GI endoscopy sedation is also mired in many controversies, mainly emanating from the cost of anesthesia providers. While no one debates their role in the majority of advanced endoscopic procedures, the practice of universal propofol sedation in the USA, delivered by anesthesia providers, needs a closer look. In this review, medical, political, and economic considerations of this important topic are discussed in a very frank and honest way. While such ubiquitous propofol use has increased satisfaction of both patients and gastroenterologists, there is little justification. More importantly, going by the evidence, there is even less justification for the mandated anesthesia providers use for such delivery. Unfortunately, the FDA could not be convinced otherwise. The new drug fospropofol met the same fate. Approval of SEDASYS?, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system, was a step in the right direction, nevertheless an insufficient step that failed to takeoff. As a result, in spite of years of research and efforts of many august societies, the logjam of balancing cost and justification of propofol sedation has continued. We hope that recent approval of remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine, and potential approval of oliceridine, a novel short-acting opioid, might be able to contain the cost without compromising the quality of sedation.","output":"Medical, Political, and Economic Considerations for the Use of MAC for Endoscopic Sedation: Big Price, Little Justification?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Patients with kidney failure have notoriously weak responses to common vaccines.

To determine immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic dialysis, we analyzed the humoral and T-cell response after two doses of mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (BNT162b2 BioNTech/Pfizer). Design, Settings, and Participants: This observational study included 43 patients on dialysis before vaccination with two doses of Tozinameran 21 days apart. Overall, 36 patients completed the observation period. Serum samples were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies ~1 and ~3-4 weeks after the second vaccination. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were assessed at the later time point by an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Outcomes at later timepoints were compared to a group of 44 elderly patients with no dialysis after immunization with Tozinameran. Exposures: Blood drawings during regular laboratory routine assessment right before start of dialysis therapy or at the time of vaccination and at follow-up study visits. Main Outcomes and Measures: Assessment of immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients on and without dialysis. Results: Median age of patients on chronic dialysis was 74.0 years (IQR 66.0, 82.0). The proportion of males was higher (69.4%) than females. Only 20/36 patients (55.6%, 95%CI: 38.29-71.67) developed SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies at first sampling, whereas 32/36 patients (88.9%, 95%CI:73.00-96.38) demonstrated seropositivity at the second sampling. Seroconversion rates and antibody titers were significantly lower compared to a cohort of vaccinees with similar age but no chronic dialysis (>90% seropositivity). SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses 3 weeks after second vaccination were detected in 21/31 vaccinated dialysis patients (67.7%, 95%CI: 48.53-82.68) compared to 42/44 (93.3%, 95%CI: 76.49-98.84) in controls of similar age. Conclusion and Relevance: Patients on dialysis demonstrate a delayed, but robust immune response three weeks after the second dose, which indicates effective vaccination of this vulnerable group.

Infectious complications due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae can lead to fulminant sepsis and death, particularly in young children, in the period shortly after splenectomy, and in immunocompromised patients. Patients with asplenia are also at risk for less common infections due to Capnocytophaga, Babesia, and malaria. Antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccines, and patient and family education are the mainstays of prevention in these at-risk patients. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis typically target high-risk periods, such as 1 to 3 years after splenectomy, children 5 years of age, or patients with concomitant immunocompromise. However, the risk for sepsis is lifelong, with infections occurring as late as 40 years after splenectomy. Currently available vaccines recommended for patients with asplenia include pneumococcal vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), meningococcal vaccines (meningococcal conjugate vaccines for serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines), H. influenzae type b vaccines, and inactivated influenza vaccines. Ongoing booster doses are also recommended for pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to maintain protection. Despite the availability of prevention tools, adherence is often a challenge.

It poses as diagnostic conundrum due to its rarity and not picked by conventional radiography. A 50-year-old male presented with pain in RLQ for past 1 day, which kept on increasing without any other symptoms. His abdomen was soft with tenderness localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), classically at McBurney's point along with mild peritonism. Rest laboratory test, chest, and abdominal X-ray were normal except slight leukocytosis. Ultrasound was inconclusive. A working clinical diagnosis of appendicitis was made. Patient did not consent for surgery and was started on antibiotics with pain killers. With no significant improvement, he underwent CT scan which revealed focal area of soft-tissue attenuation along the lateral wall of ascending colon with fat stranding. He was diagnosed as EA and improved on conservative treatment. EA of RLQ of abdomen mimics acute appendicitis and can be considered as an uncommon differential diagnosis in presence of radiological findings of normal-appearing appendix.

Synthesising evidence on quantitative health outcomes and implementation barriers and facilitators would inform practice and policy on CGA for community-dwelling older adults. METHODS We systematically searched four medical and social sciences electronic databases for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies published from 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2020. Due to heterogeneity of articles, we narratively reviewed the synthesis of evidence on health outcomes and implementation barriers and facilitators. RESULTS We screened 14,151 titles and abstracts and 203 full text articles, and included 43 selected articles. Study designs included controlled intervention studies (n = 31), pre-post studies without controls (n = 4), case-control (n = 1), qualitative methods (n = 3), and mixed methods (n = 4). A majority of articles studied populations aged 75 years (n = 18, 42%). CGAs were most frequently conducted in the home (n = 25, 58%) and primary care settings (n = 8, 19%). CGAs were conducted by nurses in most studies (n = 22, 51%). There was evidence of improved functional status (5 of 19 RCTs, 2 of 3 pre-post), frailty and fall outcomes (3 of 6 RCTs, 1 of 1 pre-post), mental health outcomes (3 of 6 RCTs, 2 of 2 pre-post), self-rated health (1 of 6 RCTs, 1 of 1 pre-post), and quality of life (4 of 17 RCTs, 3 of 3 pre-post). Barriers to implementation of CGAs involved a lack of partnership alignment and feedback, poor acceptance of preventive work, and challenges faced by providers in operationalising and optimising CGAs. The perceived benefits of CGA that served to facilitate its implementation included the use of highly skilled staff to provide holistic assessments and patient education, and the resultant improvements in care coordination and convenience to the patients, particularly where home-based assessments and management were performed. CONCLUSION There is mixed evidence on the quantitative health outcomes of CGA on community-dwelling older adults. While there is perceived positive value from CGA when carried out by highly skilled staff, barriers such as bringing providers into a partnership, greater acceptance of preventive care, and operational issues could impede its implementation.","output":"Health outcomes and implementation barriers and facilitators of comprehensive geriatric assessment in community settings: a systematic integrative review [PROSPERO registration no.: CRD42021229953]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research suggests that the coronavirus pandemic disproportionately affected poor communities.

The principle of greater involvement of PLHIV (GIPA) has and will increasingly ensure equitable access to services and engagement of marginalized groups in the HIV response, and to health services more broadly. This paper describes the history, current place in the HIV response and potential future role of PLHIV and communities in health responses. DISCUSSION: Historically, the role of communities of PLHIV and peers in service delivery, research and drug development, advocacy, social and political accountability, resource mobilization and social and human rights protection is well documented. Their leadership and engagement have contributed directly to improved outcomes in access to HIV treatment, prevention, support and care services around the world. Their continued and expanded role is especially important for the future success of HIV responses in sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV burden remains the greatest. The lessons learned from the leadership and involvement of communities of PLHIV and peers in the HIV response hold value beyond HIV responses. The models and approaches they have efficiently and effectively utilized have relevant applications in addressing shortfalls in health systems in the COVID-19 era, as well as broader, more integrated health challenges as countries move to develop and operationalize universal health coverage (UHC). However, neither HIV nor other health and development targets can be met if their contributions are not adequately recognized, valued and funded. CONCLUSIONS: The past three decades have demonstrated that communities of PLHIV and their peers are instrumental in sustaining engagement and advocacy for health equity and financing for health and ensuring that the human rights of all people are recognized and upheld. Quality and effective integration of health systems and UHC can be more effectively designed, implemented and sustained with communities of PLHIV and peers at the centre.","output":"The continuing role of communities affected by HIV in sustained engagement in health and rights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Care homes were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although high levels of psychosocial burden (i.e., anxiety, depression and stress) during the pandemic have been described for healthcare workers in hospitals, evidence on the psychosocial burden for nurses in care homes during the pandemic is scarce. METHODS: A total of 811 nurses participated in a retrospective online survey between November 2020 and February 2021. Information about the COVID-19 situation (i.e., working demands, COVID-19 cases in their facility, and COVID-19-related burden) of nurses in German care homes during the first wave of the pandemic (March 2020 to June 2020) was gathered. The Stress Scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (SDASS-21), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2), the Patients-Health-Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) were used to screen for psychosocial burden. RESULTS: Among nurses, 94.2% stated that working demands since the COVID-19 pandemic increased. Further, 59.1% showed clinically relevant levels of either stress, anxiety, and/or depression. Multiple regression analysis showed significant associations between COVID-19-related burden and qualification (p < .01), dissatisfaction with COVID-19 management of care home manager (p < .05), COVID-19-related anxiety (p < .001), and dementia as a focus of care (p < .05). Stress, depression, and anxiety showed associations with COVID-19 related burden at work (p < .01), COVID-19-related anxiety (p < .001), social support (p < .01), and sense of community (p < .05). Stress was also associated with COVID-19 cases among residents (p < .05), and size of care home (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Short- and long-term strategies (i.e., psychosocial counseling, mandatory team meetings, more highly qualified nurses, additional training) in the work environment of nursing, in crises, but beyond, should be encouraged to reduce the burden on nursing staff in care homes.

Their ages ranged from 35 to 63 years (M = 46.54; SD = 5.09). The variables assessed were anxiety, depression and stress (DASS), moods (MOOD), somatization (SCL) and resilience (CD-RISC). Descriptive analyses, t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, and hierarchical regressions were performed. All this by means of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design. RESULTS: at the beginning of the confinement parents showed low levels of emotional distress and moderate levels of positive emotionality and resilience. However, those with a prior psychological problem, who had lost their job, or had lost someone to the pandemic, showed worse emotional adjustment. Resilience was relevant in predicting anxiety-depressive symptoms, and a low level of happiness was relevant in predicting stress. Emotional symptoms improved over time, and resilience remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: the emotional impact of COVID over time is influenced by mood, mental health, and resilience. In addition, parents who had a previous health problem, had lost their job or a loved one, had a worse adjustment.

Its 2018C2020 Ebola outbreak was the second largest in history. Lessons were known from the previous West African outbreak. Chief among these was the recognition that local action and involvement are key to establishing effective epidemic-response. It remains unclear whether and how this was achieved in DRCs Ebola response. Additionally, there is a lack of scholarship on how to build resilience (the ability to adapt or transform under pressure) in crisis-response. In this article, we critically review literature to examine evidence on whether and how communities were involved, trust built, and resilience strengthened through adaptation or transformation of DRCs 2018C2020 Ebola response measures. Overall, we found limited evidence that the response adapted to engage and involve local actors and institutions or respond to locally expressed concerns. When adaptations occurred, they were shaped by national and international actors rather than enabling local actors to develop locally trusted initiatives. Communities were engaged to understand their perceptions but were not involved in decision-making or shaping responses. Few studies documented how trust was built or analyzed power dynamics between different groups in DRC. Yet, both these elements appear to be critical in building effective, resilient responses. These failures occurred because there was no willingness by the national government or international agencies to concede decision-making power to local people. Emergency humanitarian response is entrenched in highly medicalized, military style command and control approaches which have no space for decentralizing decision-making to non-experts. To transform humanitarian responses, international responders can no longer be regarded as experts who own the knowledge and control the response. To successfully tackle future humanitarian crises requires a transformation of international humanitarian and emergency response systems such that they are led, or shaped, through inclusive, equitable collaboration with local actors.","output":"Responding to the 2018C2020 Ebola Virus Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Rethinking Humanitarian Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of RNA viruses that are associated with different diseases in animals, birds, and humans.

Yet, the spatial interrelation of different areas has been rarely addressed both in the public discourse and in early accounts of the various consequences of COVID-19. METHODS: Our study proposes a spatial analysis of the association between commuting flows and COVID-19 mortality in England between March and June 2020, using a range of publicly available area-level data. To account for spatial correlation, we used a structural mobility gravity model to analyse commuting flows between Local Authority Districts. By accounting for these spatial dependencies, we temper concerns of bias and inefficiency affecting simple linear estimates. Additionally, we disentangle the direct and indirect (from other areas) influence of commuting on COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: The results of our spatial regression models suggest that higher commuting flows - in general and particularly by public transport - are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Our results are consistent with a reduction in COVID-related mortality after the introduction of a national lockdown in March. The spatial-lag term is statistically significant, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial dependencies. CONCLUSION: We suggest that considering spatial interactions through commuting or travel motivations may offer interesting perspectives on the trade-off between health and economic activity during lockdowns.","output":"Corona and Coffee on your commute: A spatial analysis of COVID-19 mortality and commuting flows in England in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The place of hospitals in health systems is undergoing rapid change worldwide due to the high cost of hospital care and the changing health needs of the population. The Covid-19 pandemic has recently drawn public attention towards hospital capacity and has added new urgency to discussions on the future role of hospitals. In this context, recent experience in Germany provides valuable information for health systems seeking to manage hospital capacity. Despite reform efforts to reduce hospital capacity, Germany has the highest rates of intensive care beds among high-income countries and the highest overall hospital capacity in Europe. The capacity of the German hospital system can be explained in large part by the high number of elderly in-patients. This, in turn, is driven by (1) a fragmented ambulatory care system; (2) physicians admitting and maintaining elderly patients in hospital at a high rate; (3) a hospital market adding incentives to admit patients; and (4) a political commitment to egalitarian access and universal care. Additionally, recent policies to reduce hospital capacity have had limited impact because hospitals have not responded to financial incentives in the expected manner. Countries looking to learn from Germany's hospital capacity must therefore consider systemic features, political commitments, and unintended policy consequences.","output":"Why are there so many hospital beds in Germany?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is mainly mediated by pathological T-cells.

While ECMO has been shown to increase risk of stroke, few studies have examined this association in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to characterise neurological events during ECMO support in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Systematic review of cohort and large case series of COVID-19 patients who received ECMO support. DATA SOURCES: Studies retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and mdRxiv from inception to November 11, 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were a) Adult population (>18 year old); b) Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 with active COVID-19 disease; c) ECMO therapy due to COVID-19 ARDS; and d) Neurological events and outcome described while on ECMO support. We excluded articles when no details of neurologic events were available. RESULTS: 1,322 patients from 12 case series and retrospective cohort studies were included in our study. The median age was 49.2, and 75% (n=985) of the patients were male. Diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia were the most common comorbidities (24% and 20%, respectively). Most (95%, n=1,241) patients were on venovenous ECMO with a median P:F ratio at the time of ECMO cannulation of 69.1. The prevalence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), ischaemic stroke, and hypoxic ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) was 5.9% (n=78), 1.1% (n=15), and 0.3% (n=4), respectively. The overall mortality of the 1,296 ECMO patients in the 10 studies that reported death was 36% (n=477), and the mortality of the subset of patients who had a neurological event was 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological injury is a concern for COVID-19 patients who receive ECMO.

No adequate treatments of muscle wasting are available. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a naturally occurring antioxidant component with multiple functions including mitochondrial modulation, demonstrates the ability to protect against muscle dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether PQQ enhances PGC-1 activation and resists skeletal muscle atrophy in mice subjected to a denervation operation. This work investigates the expression of PGC-1 and mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle of denervated mice administered PQQ. The C57BL6/J mouse was subjected to a hindlimb sciatic axotomy. A PQQ-containing ALZET? osmotic pump (equivalent to 4.5 mg/day/kg b.w.) was implanted subcutaneously into the right lower abdomen of the mouse. In the time course study, the mouse was sacrificed and the gastrocnemius muscle was prepared for further myopathological staining, energy metabolism analysis, western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR studies. We observed that PQQ administration abolished the denervation-induced decrease in muscle mass and reduced mitochondrial activities, as evidenced by the reduced fiber size and the decreased expression of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-tetrazolium reductase. Bioenergetic analysis demonstrated that PQQ reprogrammed the denervation-induced increase in the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and led to an increase in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measurement of the glycolytic metabolism. The protein levels of PGC-1 and the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes were also increased by treatment with PQQ. Furthermore, PQQ administration highly enhanced the expression of oxidative fibers and maintained the type II glycolytic fibers. This pre-clinical in vivo study suggests that PQQ may provide a potent therapeutic benefit for the treatment of denervation-induced atrophy by activating PGC-1 and maintaining the mitochondrial ETC complex in skeletal muscles.","output":"Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Resists Denervation-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy by Activating PGC-1 and Integrating Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Complexes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preparedness for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread in India calls for setting up of adequately equipped and dedicated health facilities to manage sick patients while protecting healthcare workers and the environment.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known to increase the risk of lung cancer. PAHs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A subfamily, comprised of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 monooxygenases. These enzymes bioactivate PAHs into reactive metabolites that induce mutagenic DNA adducts, which can lead to cancer. Past studies have investigated the role of CYP1A1 in PAH bioactivation; however, the individual roles of each CYP1A enzyme are still unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice lacking the genes for Cyp1a1 or Cyp1a2 will display altered susceptibilities to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT), Cyp1a1-null (Cyp1a1-/-), and Cyp1a2-null (Cyp1a2-/-) male and female mice were treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) for cancer initiation and tumor formation studies. In WT mice, CYP1A1 and 1A2 expression was induced by MC. Cyp1a1-/- and Cyp1a2-/- mice treated with PAHs displayed a compensatory pattern, where knocking out one Cyp1a gene led to increased expression of the other. Cyp1a1-/- mice were resistant to DNA adduct and tumor formation, while Cyp1a2-/- mice displayed increased levels of both. UALCAN analysis revealed that lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with high levels of CYP1A2 expression survive significantly better than patients with low/medium expression. In conclusion, Cyp1a1-/- mice were less susceptible to PAH-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis, while Cyp1a2-/- mice were more susceptible. Additionally, high CYP1A2 expression was found to be protective for LUAD patients. These results support the need to develop novel CYP1A1 inhibitors to mitigate human lung cancer.","output":"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH)-Induced Pulmonary Carcinogenesis in Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1- and 1A2-null Mice: Roles of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the ease of access to information, and its rapid dissemination over the internet (both velocity and volume), it has become challenging to filter out truthful information from fake ones.

Next, we collected the serums from healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients with different severities and profile the neutralizing activity as well as antibody isotypes. We identified the inhibition of ACE2 binding was stronger against multiple variants in severe compared to mild/moderate or critical patients. Moreover, the serum IgG against nonstructural protein 3 was elevated in severe but not in mild/moderate and critical cases. Finally, we evaluated two ACE2 inhibitors, Ramipril and Perindopril, and found the dose-dependent inhibition of ACE2 binding to all the spike variants except for B.1.617.3.

In this study, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of the southern Jiangsu (SJ) segment of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal (SJ-BHGC) were explored. Fluorescent component similarity and high-performance size exclusion chromatography analyses indicated that the textile printing and dyeing wastewater might be one of the main pollution sources in SJ-BHGC. The water quality parameters and intensities of fluorescent components (WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20)) decreased to low level due to the collective shutdown of all industries in SJ region during the Spring Festival holiday and the outbreak of the domestic COVID-19 pandemic in China (January 24th to late February, 2020). Then, they presented a gradual upward trend after the domestic epidemic was under control. In mid-March, the outbreak of the international COVID-19 pandemic hit the garment export trade of China and consequently inhibited the production activities of textile printing and dyeing industry (TPDI) in SJ region. After peaking on March 26th, the intensities of WT-C1(20) and WT-C2(20) decreased again with changed intensity ratio until April 12th.

In order to benefit from its experience in the least affected countries, this study aims to describe the current situation of the epidemic and then retrospectively estimate its real burden. As a first part of the study, we described the indicators of the epidemic as; the cumulative and daily reported cases and deaths, and we computed the R0 evolution. Secondly, we used the New York City cases-fatality rate standardized by Algerian age structure, to retrospectively estimate the actual burden. We found that reported cases are in a clear diminution, but, the epidemic epicentre is moving from Blida to other cities. We noted a clear peak in daily cases-fatality from March 30, to April 17, 2020, Fig. 3, due to underestimating the actual infections of the first 25 days. Since May 8, 2020, the daily R0 is around one, Fig. 4. Moreover, we noticed 31% reduction of its mean value from 1,41 to 0,97 between the last two months. The Algerian Age-Standardized Infection Fatality Rate we found is 0,88%. Based on that, we demonstrated that only 1,5% of actual infections were detected and reported before March 30, and 20% after March 31, Fig. 5. Therefore, the actual infections burden is currently five times higher than reported. At the end, we found that at least 0,2 % of the population have been infected until May 27. Consequently, the acquired herd immunity to date is therefore not sufficient to avoid a second wave.

Data were combined with odds ratio (OR) and metanalysed. Severe COVID-19 was defined by acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission and death. RESULTS: We included 12 studies with 2794 patients, of whom 596 (21.33%) had severe disease. A slightly higher age was found in severe vs non-severe disease. We found that prevalent cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-7.72), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.10-5.19), prevalent cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-5.10), diabetes (OR: 2.78, 95% CI 2.09-3.72), hypertension (OR: 2.24, 95% CI 1.63-3.08), smoking (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22) and male sex (OR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.49) were associated with severe disease.

METHODS: A total of 65 ambulatory patients with SLE and 9 healthy controls underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scanning, for quantitative assessment of BBB permeability. Volumetric data were extracted using the VolBrain pipeline. Global cognitive function was evaluated using a screening battery consisting of tasks falling into five broad cognitive domains, and was compared between patients with normal versus extensive BBB leakage. RESULTS: Patients with SLE had significantly higher levels of BBB leakage compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage (affecting over >9% of brain volume) was identified only in patients with SLE (16/65; 24.6%), who also had smaller right and left cerebral grey matter volumes compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage was associated with lower global cognitive scores (p=0.02), and with the presence of impairment on one or more cognitive tasks (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for a link between extensive BBB leakage and changes in both brain structure and cognitive function in patients with SLE. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms underlying BBB-mediated cognitive impairment, validate the diagnostic utility of BBB imaging, and determine the potential of targeting the BBB as a therapeutic strategy in patients with SLE.","output":"Blood-brain barrier leakage in systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with gray matter loss and cognitive impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative residual knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a significant factor that contributes to patient dissatisfaction. Patients with preoperative central sensitization (CS) may be more susceptible to unexplained chronic pain after TKA, and duloxetine has been reported to be effective in post-TKA pain control in patients with CS. However, there remains limited evidence to support this off-label use in routine clinical practice. Hence, we designed this randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind clinical trial to evaluate the effects of preoperative screening and targeted duloxetine treatment of CS on postoperative residual pain compared with the care-as-usual control group. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial includes patients with knee osteoarthritis on a waiting list for primary unilateral TKA. Patients with preoperative CS will be randomly allocated to the perioperative duloxetine treatment group (duloxetine group) or the care-as-usual control group (placebo group). Patients in the duloxetine group will receive a half-dose of preemptive duloxetine (30 mg/day) for a week before surgery and a full-dose of duloxetine (60 mg/day) for six weeks after surgery. The primary outcome is the intensity of residual pain at six months after TKA, including the visual analogue scale, 11-point numeric rating scale, the sensory dimension of the brief pain inventory, and the pain subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The secondary outcome measures will include the pain and function related outcomes. All of the patients will be followed up at one, three, and six months after surgery. All adverse events will be recorded and immediately reported to the primary investigator and ethics committee to decide if the patient needs to drop out from the trial. DISCUSSION: This clinical trial will convey the latest evidence of the efficacy and safety of the application of duloxetine in postoperative pain control in CS patients who are scheduled for TKA.

However, interpretation of the results of serologic studies has been hampered by the diversity of approaches and the lack of standardized methods and reporting. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the CONSISE ROSES \\\\I statement was to improve the quality and transparency of reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies and facilitate the assessment of the validity and generalizability of published results. METHODS: The ROSES\\\\I statement was developed as an expert consensus of the CONSISE epidemiology and laboratory working groups. The recommendations are presented in the familiar format of a reporting guideline. Because seroepidemiologic studies are a specific type of observational epidemiology study, the ROSES\\\\I statement is built upon the STROBE guidelines. As such, the ROSES\\\\I statement should be seen as an extension of the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: The ROSES \\\\I statement presents 42 items that can be used as a checklist of the information that should be included in the results of published seroepidemiologic studies, and which can also serve as a guide to the items that need to be considered during study design and implementation.

Living in such camps make it difficult to stay healthy due to the psychological stresses associated with the loss of privacy, the hygienic conditions and the bad nutrition. While these conditions are known, few studies exist that capture the lived experiences of refugees in such shelters. METHODS: The project Vulnerability and empowerment: Participatory approaches to health promotion with refugees' (EMPOW), funded by the German Research Foundation (2019-2022) applies a participatory design involving three study sites. In Munich, the Photovoice method was used to identify health challenges in the camps. Examples are shown and discussed. RESULTS: Being forced to live in camps constitutes a specific hazard to the health of refugees. Often, they are not allowed to cook or to bring their own food. Canteens, bedrooms and sanitary facilities are shared with many people, which poses a major hygiene problems (especially during the Corona pandemic). Particularly for pregnant women this situation is harmful to their health. The COVID-19-pandemic worsens these problems significantly e.g. via quarantine measures that are imposed on shelters and its inhabitants for long periods. CONCLUSIONS: The photovoice stories document the serious deficits of the shelter system from a community perspective showing how these are detrimental to the inhabitants' health. Suggestions are made for improving the situation so that persons seeking asylum in Germany have better chances to stay healthy. The perspective of refugees themselves on these challenges must be taken seriously in order to improve their health.

METHODS: Data were collected from 528 socioeconomically disadvantaged Chinese university students through electronic questionnaires on perceived discrimination, self-compassion, and psychological distress (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) in two waves with a 1-year interval. RESULTS: Only CS moderated the relationships between perceived discrimination and all three indicators of psychological distress; overall, SC and RUS did not play moderating roles in these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: CS buffered the impact of perceived discrimination on subsequent psychological distress. This suggests that the protective function of self-compassion might lie mainly in the role played by CS in psychopathological domains (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress, rumination, negative affect) or in the stressor-psychological distress link.

Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data.

CASE SUMMARY: We report two cases with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and myocardial injury with large LV thrombi and other multisystem thrombotic events. The first patient represents an unusual case of large LV apical thrombus without concordant regional wall motion abnormality and mildly reduced LV function. A subsequent inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was likely related to either an embolic event or in situ coronary thrombosis. We could not ascertain whether the acute right ventricular dysfunction was due to in situ pulmonary thrombosis or inferior STEMI. The catastrophic cerebrovascular accident was likely an embolic phenomenon. Similarly, the second patient demonstrated multiple large pedunculated thrombi occupying one-third of the LV cavity with moderately reduced LV function. A segmental pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on computed tomography chest, confirming multiple territories of in situ thrombosis. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related inflammatory cytokine release has been linked to activation of coagulation pathways. Marked elevation of ferritin and C-reactive protein levels in both patients were consistent with evidence of a hyperinflammatory state with cytokine storm. Furthermore, the finding of elevated D-dimer levels lends support to the altered coagulation cascade that plausibly explains the multisystem thrombosis observed in our patients.

We analyze a base set of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic at an earlier stage, an intermediate set of 88 countries and an extended set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.

The pneumoperitoneum was created by a periumbilical 12-mm trocar, through which a laparoscope was advanced for intra-abdominal visualization. For TV-NOTES PN, a gastroscope was used to obtain TV peritoneal access. For TR-NOTES PN, a horizontal incision was made 2 cm above the dentate line, and a submucosal tunnel was created in the posterior rectal wall. The gastroscope was advanced through the submucosal tunnel and retroperitoneum to the kidney, and a peritoneal window was created. For both TR- and TV-NOTES PN, the gastroscope was exchanged for the SPIDER Surgical System. Flexible dissecting instruments and hook cautery introduced through the SPIDER Surgical System were used to mobilize the kidney.

In contrast, the other stakeholders mentioned to have no or little experience with such interventions. Factors like anonymity, availability and cost-effectiveness were seen as major advantages. Also disadvantages, e.g. lack of personal contact, limitations by disease severity and concerns on data safety, were mentioned. Stakeholders stated the need for interventions which are usable, evidence-based, tailored and provide personal support. CONCLUSION: Stakeholders considered Internet-based programmes to have more advantages than disadvantages. Effort should be put in providing systematic education to address prejudices. When offering an online intervention, stakeholders needs, as well as a continuous evaluation and adaptation, have to be taken into account.","output":"Stakeholders perspectives on online interventions to improve mental health in eating disorder patients and carers in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of new effective anti-coronavirus drugs and therapies is important, but it requires significant human, financial and, most importantly, time expenditures.

Several recent scientific studies have shown that medicinal plants and vitamins can benefit and improve the health of COVID-19 patients. However, the benefits of medicinal plants and vitamins in the treatment of COVID-19 remain unproven. Therefore, the objective of this article is to expounds the benefits of using medicinal plants (Allium sativum, curcumin, Nigella sativa, Zingiber officitale) and vitamins (vitamin C and vitamin D) that possess the antiviral properties for the prevention and/or control of COVID-19. To reach our objective, we searched scientific databases of ongoing trials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites, PubMed Central, Medline databases, and Google Scholar websites. We also searched databases on World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to collect relevant papers. We found that all of the selected medicinal plants and vitamins possess antiviral activities, and their individual intake shows promise for the prevention and/or control of COVID-19.

Its efficacy as a barrier protection in addition to the use of a standard personal protective equipment (PPE) is not fully known. We performed a simulated study to investigate the relationship between aerosol box usage during intubation and contaminations on healthcare workers pre-doffing and post-doffing of PPE. METHODS: This was a randomised cross-over study conducted between 9 April to 5 May 2020 in the ED of University Malaya Medical Centre. Postgraduate Emergency Medicine trainees performed video laryngoscope-assisted intubation on an airway manikin with and without an aerosol box in a random order. Contamination was simulated by nebulised Glo Germ. Primary outcome was number of contaminated front and back body regions pre-doffing and post-doffing of PPE of the intubator and assistant. Secondary outcomes were intubation time, Cormack-Lehane score, number of intubation attempts and participants feedback. RESULTS: Thirty-six trainees completed the study interventions. The number of contaminated front and back body regions pre-doffing of PPE was significantly higher without the aerosol box (all p values<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the number of contaminations post-doffing of PPE between using and not using the aerosol box, with a median contamination of zero. Intubation time was longer with the aerosol box (42.5 s vs 35.5 s, p<0.001). Cormack-Lehane scores were similar with and without the aerosol box. First-pass intubation success rate was 94.4% and 100% with and without the aerosol box, respectively. More participants reported reduced mobility and visibility when intubating with the aerosol box. CONCLUSIONS: An aerosol box may significantly reduce exposure to contaminations but with increased intubation time and reduced operators mobility and visibility. Furthermore, the difference in degree of contamination between using and not using an aerosol box could be offset by proper doffing of PPE.","output":"COVID-19 aerosol box as protection from droplet and aerosol contaminations in healthcare workers performing airway intubation: a randomised cross-over simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This final chapter discusses the policy insights and implications derived from the Energy Atlas and the research projects it has enabled, as well as directions for future research that are supportive of a just energy transition.

The ever-increasing need for fuels and increasing nutritional problems have made a serious concern on the demand for nutrients and renewable and eco-friendly fuel sources. Currently, the use of fossil fuels is creating ecological and economic problems. Microalgae have been considered as a promising candidate for high-value metabolites and alternative renewable energy sources. Microalgae offer several advantages such as rapid growth rate, efficient land utilization, carbon dioxide sequestration, ability to cultivate in wastewater, and most importantly, they do not participate in the food crop versus energy crop dilemma or debate. An efficient microalgal biorefinery system for the production of lipids and subsequent byproduct for nutraceutical applications could well satisfy the need. But, the current microalgal cultivation systems for the production of lipids and nutraceuticals do not offer techno-economic feasibility together with energy and environmental sustainability. This review article has its main focus on the production of lipids and nutraceuticals from microalgae, covering the current strategies used for lipid production and the major high-value metabolites from microalgae and their nutraceutical importance.

This research work evaluates the difference of extracted RNA purity of pooled samples with and without treatment with isopropyl alcohol and its effect on real-time RT-PCR. As per the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 5 sample pools were analysed using qRT-PCR. A total of 100 pooled samples were selected for the study by mixing 50 L of one COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimen and 50 L each of 4 known negative specimens. Pool RNA was extracted using the column-based method, and 1 set of pooled extracted RNA was tested as such, while RNA of the second set was treated additionally with chilled isopropyl alcohol (modified protocol). Further, the purity of extracted RNA in both the groups was checked using Microvolume Spectrophotometers (Nanodrop) followed by RT-PCR targeting E-gene and RNaseP target. The results showed that the purity index of extracted RNA of untreated pooled specimens was inferior to isopropyl alcohol-treated templates, which was observed to be 85% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The average Cq (E gene) in the unpurified and purified pool RNA group was 34.66 and 31.48, respectively. The nanodrop data suggested that purified RNA concentration was significantly increased with an average value of 24.73  1.49 ng/uL, which might be the reason for high sensitivity and specificity. Thus, this group testing of SARS-CoV-2 cases using pools of 5 individual samples would be the best alternative for saving molecular reagents, personnel time, and can increase the overall testing capacity. However, purity of RNA is one of the important determinants to procure unfailing results, thus, this additional purification step must be included in the protocol after RNA has been extracted using commercially available kit before performing qRT-PCR.","output":"Assessment of Successful qRT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 Assay in Pool Screening Using Isopropyl Alcohol Purification Step in RNA Extraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The molecular interactions between viral proteins form the basis of virus production and can be used to develop strategies against virus infection. The interactions of the envelope proteins and the viral RNA-binding nucleocapsid (N) protein are essential for the assembly of coronaviruses including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods: Using co-immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and proteomics analysis, we identified a protein interacting with the spike (S) protein in the cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. To confirm the interaction, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the S protein (Spike CD) were produced and their effect on the interaction was investigated in vitro. In vivo effect of the Spike CD peptides after cell penetration was further investigated using viral plaque formation assay. Phylogeographic analyses were conducted to deduce homology of Spike CDs and N proteins. Results: We identified a direct interaction between the S protein and the N protein of MERS-CoV that takes place during virus assembly in infected cells. Spike CD peptides of MERS-CoV inhibited the interaction between the S and N proteins in vitro. Furthermore, cell penetration by the synthetic Spike CD peptides inhibited viral plaque formation in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Phylogeographic analyses of Spike CDs and N proteins showed high homology among betacoronavirus lineage C strains. To determine if Spike CD peptides can inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used the same strategy and found that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike CD peptide inhibited virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Conclusions: We suggest that the interaction between the S protein and the N protein can be targeted to design new therapeutics against emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","output":"MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication can be inhibited by targeting the interaction between the viral spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CRISPR diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx) technology that employs the trans-cleavage activities has shown great potential in diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, convenience, and portability, and has been recognized as the next-generation diagnostic methods.

METHODS The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes centre during the past year. The survey was carried out through telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed(83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their healthcare providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized telemedicine facility(n=117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of self-monitoring of blood glucose(SMBG) increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown.

METHODS: Records of patients aged over 18 and admitted with BTT between January 2017 and October 2019 dates were ret-rospectively evaluated. Only patients with both BTT and rib fracture were included in the study. Age, gender, trauma mechanism, additional organ injuries, and need for intensive care unit of patients were identified. The total length of hospital stay, length of stay in the intensive care unit, treatment modalities, need for mechanical ventilator; blood and blood products, complications, and mortality rates for patients were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six (73.8%) and 66 (26.2%) of 252 included patients were male and female, respectively. The most commonly seen trauma mechanism was motor vehicle accidents (51.4%). The mean age of patients was 5212 (18-91). We identified that there was a significant association between hemothorax and non-thoracic additional organ injuries (p=0.024). There was no significant association between pneumothorax and additional organ injuries (p=0.067). The number of fractured ribs was significantly different between cases with and without hemothorax (p<0.001). There was also a significant difference between cases with and without pneumothorax in terms of the number of broken ribs (p<0.039). There was a significant difference between cases undergone thoracotomy and cases who did not undergo thoracotomy in terms of mean length of stay in the hospital (p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between the number of broken ribs and length of stay in the hospital (r=320, p<0.001).

Here we evaluated the immune response specific for Micobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 using a whole-blood-based assay-platform in COVID-19 patients either with TB or latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: We evaluated IFN-?3 level in plasma from whole-blood stimulated with Mtb antigens in the Quantiferon-Plus format or with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (CD4-S). RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 63 COVID-19, 10 TB-COVID-19 and 11 LTBI-COVID-19 patients. IFN-?3 response to Mtb-antigens was significantly associated to TB status and therefore it was higher in TB-COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19 patients (p &#8804; 0.0007). Positive responses against CD4-S were found in 35/63 COVID-19 patients, 7/11 LTBI-COVID-19 and only 2/10 TB-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the responders in the TB-COVID-19 group were less compared to COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.037 and 0.044, respectively). Moreover, TB-COVID-19 patients showed the lowest quantitative IFN-?3 response to CD4-S compared to COVID-19-patients (p = 0.0336) and LTBI-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0178).

We argue that the effective response of Malawi to limit the spread of the virus was facilitated by the engagement of local leadership to mobilize communities to adapt and adhere to Covid-19 prevention strategies. Using linear and ordered probit models and controlling for time fixed effects, we show that village heads (VHs) played pivotal role in shaping individuals knowledge about the pandemic and the adoption of preventive health behaviors and were crucial for mitigating the negative economic and health consequences of the pandemic. We further show that trust in institutions is of particular importance in shaping individuals behavior during the pandemic, and these findings highlight the pivotal role of community leadership in fostering better compliance and adoption of public health measures essential to contain the virus. Overall, our findings point to distinctive patterns of pandemic response in a low-income sub-Saharan African rural population that emphasized local leadership as mediators of public health messages and policies.

Ninety\\\\six articles were included in our review. Key article characteristics were year of publication, sample size, country, study design, definition of depression, definition of wealth, and association between wealth and depression. Thirty\\\\two longitudinal articles were included in a detailed charted review. RESULTS: Depression was defined in a relatively standard manner across articles. In contrast, definitions and measurements of wealth varied greatly. The majority of studies in the full review (n = 56, 58%) and half of the studies in the longitudinal charted review (n = 16, 50%) reported an inverse relation between wealth and depression. The longitudinal charted review showed that (1) macro\\\\economic events influenced depression, (2) wealth status influenced depression across the lifecourse, (3) wealth protected against depression in the face of stressors such as job loss, (4) subjective or psychosocial factors such as perception of wealth, relative comparison, and social status modified the relation between wealth and depression, and (5) savings interventions were successful in reducing depression and varied by context.

Health care workers are required to use a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged hours and, as a result, they face varying degrees of cutaneous complications. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey to investigate skin problems caused by the use of PPE and personal hygiene measures. We developed a survey with 32 questions using Google forms and distributed it via WhatsApp and Facebook groups. RESULTS A total of 1142 responses were obtained. Among the respondents, 88.1% reported adverse skin reactions due to PPE and personal hygiene measures. Female sex, working as a nurse, wearing PPE more than 6 hours per day, and working more than 3 days per week increase the risk of PPE-related skin problems.

Early recognition to identify serious adverse events such as ischemia/ perforation is critical to reducing mortality rates. COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant shift of resources for the treatment of patients with reduced utilization of endoscopy and imaging, which could have impacted outcomes in patients with ACPO. In this study, we aim to identify the change in the clinical outcomes in ACPO patients in 2020. Methods: All adult patients with a new diagnosis of intestinal obstruction without mechanical cause were identified using ICD-10 codes (K59.8, K56.69). Patients diagnosed with megacolon (K59.3) were excluded. Patients were included from TriNetX, a federated cloud-based network that comprises 92 healthcare organizations across the entire US. The primary outcomes were rates of pharmacological therapy (neostigmine use), lower GI endoscopic decompression (Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy), surgery (laparotomy), and overall 30 day- mortality. The outcomes were measured after 1:1 propensity matching of the groups based on the baseline demographics and comorbidities. Results: A total of 24,310 patients were diagnosed with ACPO in 2020 compared to 95,014 with a reduced incidence of 74.5%. Comorbidities of these patients at presentation and clinical outcomes are noted in Table 1. Patients with behavioral/neurodevelopmental disorders, obesity, opioid use and laxative were significantly higher in ACPO patients. After matching, rates of neostigmine use (risk ratio [RR]- 0.71 (CI- 0.41 - 1.23)), imaging (CT/MRI) (RR- 0.86 (CI- 0.72 - 1.03)), surgery ((RR- 0.93 (CI- 0.83 - 1.03)) did not differ between the groups. Endoscopic utilization reduced significantly in 2020 (RR- 0.86 (CI- 0.78 - 0.95)). Furthermore, mortality was low in 2020 group (RR- 0.74 (CI- 0.65 - 0.84)). Conclusion: The rates of ACPO diagnosis in 2020 reduced by 74.5% compared to 2019. Although the neostigmine use, cross-sectional imaging use, and surgery rates did not change, endoscopic utilization was reduced by 15%. This was noted despite a need for urgent endoscopic decompression needed in these patients.

Several factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.","output":"Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM and Dynamic Behavioral Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: Las clulas ?-pancreticas son susceptibles a la infeccin y replicacin de SARS-CoV-2, lo que podra conducir a una diabetes relacionada con infeccin o precipitar el debut de una diabetes tipo 1.

There are conflicting results about the duration of antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2, but several studies show a rapid decay in a few months after infection. To evaluate antibody decline, we re-evaluated the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among individuals found seropositive in a first population survey conducted 4 months before. Methods. All individuals above ten years of age resident in 5 municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Trento, northern Italy, who resulted IgG positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies in a serosurvey conducted on May 2020 were retested after 4 months. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott Diagnostics, USA) detecting anti-NC antibodies. Samples that gave a negative result were re-tested using the same test plus Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy) to assess anti-spike (S) S1/S2 IgG antibodies. Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive people on the total number of tested. A neutralizing assay was performed on a subgroup of formerly positives sera using fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) as endpoint dilution to produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated Vero E6 cells culture. In all the analyses a p value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by STATA version 16.1 (STATA Corp., College Station, Texas, USA). Findings. Overall, 1159 out of 1402 initially anti-NC seropositive participants were enrolled in the study. Of them, 480 (41.1%) became seronegative for anti-NC IgG antibodies. When 479 negative sera were tested for anti-S IgG, 373 samples (77.9%) resulted positives. A functional neutralization assay was performed on 106 sera showing high concordance with anti-S antibodies positivity. Interpretation. A decline of anti-NC IgG values was recorded 4 months after the first evaluation. Worth of note, a high proportion of anti-NC seronegative individuals were positive for anti-spike IgG antibodies, which appear to persist longer and to better correlate with neutralization activity.","output":"Longevity of seropositivity and neutralizing titers among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals after 4 months from baseline: a population-based study in the province of Trento"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclic and macrocyclic peptides constitute advanced molecules for modulating proteinCprotein interactions (PPIs).

Previous report showed that NS5A inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling induced by poly(I:C); however, the mechanism was not elucidated. Here, we report that NS5A interacts with NF-B essential modulator (NEMO),a regulatory subunit of the IB kinase (IKK) complex, and that the zinc finger domain of NEMO essential for NEMO ubiquitination and IKK activation is required for the interaction of NEMO with NS5A. Viral infection or NS5A expression by itself reduced the protein level of NEMO. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NS5A mediated proteasomal degradation of NEMO. Ubiquitination assay showed that NS5A induced K27-but not K48-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO. In addition, NS5A blocked k63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, thereby inhibiting activation of IKK and NF-B. These findings indicate that NS5A inhibits NF-B signaling by mediating proteasomal degradation of NEMO and blocking k63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, thereby revealing a novel mechanism by which CSFV inhibits host innate immunity. Importance Classical swine fever (CSF) is a economically important swine viral disease leading to hemorrhagic fever and immuno-suppression. In order to successfully infect and replicate in a host cell, viruses have evolved various strategies to antagonize host innate immunity. It is known that CSFV non-structural protein Npro interacts with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and mediates its proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting the production of type I interferon. However, no other mechanism by which CSFV antagonizes host innate immunity has so far been reported.

Accordingly, three typical desulfurization share setups of 80%, 85%, and 90% were compared under various operational conditions by varying the fuel-sulfur content, liquid/gas ratio, and seawater alkalinity. In complying with the desulfurization requirements of emission control areas, 85% was obtained as the optimal desulfurization share among the three setups.

At relatively higher sulfur content above 3.5%, the open-loop solution solely achieved the desulfurization requirements of non-emission control areas by using higher liquid/gas ratio levels of 6.5-8.0 L/Nm3, while fully failed to meet the much stricter requirements of emission control areas except the lowest 1.5% fuel-sulfur conditions.

Acute exacerbations lead to an increase in symptoms, decline in lung function and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this review is to do a literature search for any prophylactic anti-microbial treatment trials in GOLD class D patients who failed recommended therapy and discuss the role of COPD phenotypes, lung and gut microbiota and co-morbidities in developing a tailored approach to anti-microbial therapies for high frequency exacerbators. MAIN TEXT: There is a paucity of large, well-conducted studies in the published literature to date. Factors such as single-centre, study design, lack of well-defined controls, insufficient patient numbers enrolled and short follow-up periods were significant limiting factors in numerous studies. One placebo-controlled study involving more than 1000 patients, who had 2 or more moderate exacerbations in the previous year, demonstrated a non-significant reduction in exacerbations of 19% with 5 day course of moxifloxacillin repeated at 8 week intervals. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) colonised COPD patients, inhaled antimicrobial therapy using tobramycin, colistin and gentamicin resulted in significant reductions in exacerbation frequency. Viruses were found to frequently cause acute exacerbations in COPD (AECOPD), either as the primary infecting agent or as a co-factor. However, other, than the influenza vaccination, there were no trials of anti-viral therapies that resulted in a positive effect on reducing AECOPD. Identifying clinical phenotypes and co-existing conditions that impact on exacerbation frequency and severity is essential to provide individualised treatment with targeted therapies. The role of the lung and gut microbiome is increasingly recognised and identification of pathogenic bacteria will likely play an important role in personalised antimicrobial therapies. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial therapeutic options in patients who continue to exacerbate despite adherence to guidelines-directed therapy are limited. Phenotyping patients, identification of co-existing conditions and assessment of the microbiome is key to individualising antimicrobial therapy. Given the impact of viruses on AECOPD, anti-viral therapeutic agents and targeted anti-viral vaccinations should be the focus of future research studies.","output":"Antimicrobial therapies for prevention of recurrent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): beyond the guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prevented a group-based partial hospitalization program (PHP) from running in-person care due to social distancing guidelines. However, the crisis also simultaneously increased stress on families while decreasing their desire to hospitalize youth for a nonmedical issue. Hence, the need for a PHP remained high. Health care organizations worked diligently to create a secure telehealth platform (tele-PHP) to be delivered to patients in their home environments. This article describes the development and implementation of child and adolescent tele-PHPs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new programs were started in mid-March 2020, and changes were implemented over the next 3 to 4 weeks. Overall, patients and families have been receptive to behavioral health services delivered through telemedicine. While tele-PHPs are the most plausible solution to continue behavioral health care for these patients, some challenges were observed during this process. Besides procedural and technological challenges associated with creating a virtual setup, other difficulties include variable patient engagement, specific treatment-related challenges, and system-related changes. These challenges are addressed through psychoeducation, provision of online measures to assess treatment outcomes, and efforts to optimize parent engagement prior to treatment initiation for better treatment adherence. Initial experiences during a time of crisis suggest that tele-PHP services can be a viable long-term treatment option in the future during both a disaster and routine times to improve access for those who otherwise cannot take advantage of such services.

Moreover, we also explored the mutation landscape, expression pattern, and prognostic implications of genes involved with COVID-19 in distinct cancers. Among all of the cancer types we analyzed, only the genetic predisposition to lung adenocarcinoma was causally associated with increased COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.93,  = 1.074, se = 0.411, p = 0.009) with no obvious heterogeneity (Q = 17.29, p = 0.24) or symmetry of the funnel plot. In addition, the results of the pleiotropy test demonstrated that instrument SNPs were less likely to affect COVID-19 severity via approaches other than lung adenocarcinoma cancer susceptibility (p = 0.96). Leave-one-out analysis showed no outliers in instrument SNPs, whose elimination rendered alterations in statistical significance, which further supported the reliability of the MR results. Broad mutation and differential expression of these genes were also found in cancers, which may provide valuable information for developing new treatment modalities for patients with both cancer and COVID-19.

We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness. Conclusions and recommendations: Due to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing handwashing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","output":"Global epidemiology, pathogenesis, immune response, diagnosis, treatment, economic and psychological impact, challenges, and future prevention of COVID-19: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the generation Z (Gen Z) cohort&rsquo;s self-assessed knowledge regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms as well as their interest in acquiring information and learning more about the transmission and spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2 virus) and the COVID-19 symptoms Additionally, it investigates gender differences in self-assessed knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms Field research employing a nonprobability sampling method with an online questionnaire resulted in collecting 762 valid questionnaires Data analysis included descriptive statistics, factor and reliability analysis, and the independent sample t-test Results reveal that overall symptom knowledge was assessed higher than the self-assessed knowledge of the 13 specific symptoms No gender differences were detected regarding self-assessed knowledge of the following COVID-19 symptoms: cough, dyspnea, anorexia, productive cough with expectoration (phlegm), headache, and diarrhea On the other hand, for self-assessed overall knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as self-assessed knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms related to fever and fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), pharyngodynia, nausea&ndash;vomitus, hemoptysis, and abdominal pain, the t-tests conducted showed that there are statistical differences in knowledge assessment between male and female subjects Based on the outcomes, the paper provides marketing communication practices targeting this young generation cohort to raise awareness so that Gen Z&rsquo;ers may react effectively if these symptoms are observed and, thus, request medical assistance","output":"Knowledge Assessment of COVID-19 Symptoms: Gender Differences and Communication Routes for the Generation Z Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection spreaded rapidly worldwide, as far as it has become a global pandemic. Therefore, the introduction of serological tests for determination of IgM and IgG antibodies has become the main diagnostic tool, useful for tracking the spread of the virus and for consequently allowing its containment. In our study we compared point of care test (POCT) lateral flow immunoassay (FIA) vs automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), in order to assess their specificity and sensibility for COVID-19 antibodies detection. RESULTS: We find that different specificities and sensitivities for IgM and IgG tests. Notably IgM POCT FIA method vs CLIA method (gold standard) has a low sensitivity (0.526), while IgG POCT FIA method vs CLIA method (gold standard) test has a much higher sensitivity (0.937); further, with respect of IgG, FIA and CLIA could arguably provide equivalent information.

Apart from antivirals and respiratory support, anticoagulants, corticoids and immunomodulators are increasingly being prescribed, especially for more severe cases. We describe the clinical outcome of a large cohort of patients preferentially treated with glucocorticoids and interleukin inhibitors. Methods Single center and retrospective case series. Adult patients admitted with COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency were included.Patients who died within 2 days after admission and those testing positive but asymptomatic were excluded. We defined two study periods: from March 3rd to March 31 st, 2020 (beginning of epidemic until peak of incidence) and April 1 st to May 7 th,2020 (second half of epidemic). The majority of patients received respiratory support,combinations of antimicrobials, anticoagulants, corticoids and interleukin inhibitors.Antivirals were preferentially given in the first period. The clinical outcome (death and ventilator dependency) of both periods was compared. Results From March 3 rd to May 7 th, 685 patients were included for analysis (58.4% males, mean age 68.9 years). Patients in the first period (n=408) were younger (66.6 vs 71.1 years, p=0.003),presented lower mean P a O 2/F i O2 ratio at admission (256.5 vs 270.4 mm Hg,p=0.0563), higher ferritin (1520 vs 1221 ng/ml, p=0.01), higher IL-6 (679 vs 194 pg/ml,p<0.0001) and similar D-dimer levels (3.59 vs 3.39 g/mL, p=0.65) compared to the second period (n=277). Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon were preferentially given in the first period (23.8% and 32% vs 1.8% and 11.9%, p<0.0001). Use of corticoids (88.2% vs 87.4%, p=0,74) and tocilizumab (26.29 vs 20.22% p=0.06) were similarly administered in both periods. Patients in the second period needed less mechanical ventilation (4.9% vs 16.9%, p<0.0001), fewer ICU admission (6.1% vs 20.1%,p<0.0001) and showed similar mortality (17.7% vs 15.4%, p=0.43).

S100P is a member of large family of multifunctional Ca(2+)-binding proteins with cytokine-like activities.

Relative to Canada, US methadone provision is more restricted and limited to specialized opioid treatment programs. OBJECTIVE: To compare timely access to methadone initiation in the US and Canada during COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2020. Participating clinics provided methadone for opioid use disorder in 14 US states and territories and 3 Canadian provinces with the highest opioid overdose death rates. Statistical analysis was performed from July 2020 to January 2021. EXPOSURES: Nation and type of health insurance (US Medicaid and US self-pay vs Canadian provincial). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of clinics accepting new patients and days to first appointment. RESULTS: Among 268 of 298 US clinics contacted as a patient with Medicaid (90%), 271 of 301 US clinics contacted as a self-pay patient (90%), and 237 of 288 Canadian clinics contacted as a patient with provincial insurance (82%), new patients were accepted for methadone at 231 clinics (86%) during US Medicaid contacts, 230 clinics (85%) during US self-pay contacts, and at 210 clinics (89%) during Canadian contacts. Among clinics not accepting new patients, at least 44% of 27 clinics reported that the COVID-19 pandemic was the reason. The mean wait for first appointment was greater among US Medicaid contacts (3.5 days [95% CI, 2.9-4.2 days]) and US self-pay contacts (4.1 days [95% CI, 3.4-4.8 days]) than Canadian contacts (1.9 days [95% CI, 1.7-2.1 days]) (P < .001). Open-access model (walk-in hours for new patients without an appointment) utilization was reported by 57 Medicaid (30%), 57 self-pay (30%), and 115 Canadian (59%) contacts offering an appointment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of 2 nations, more than 1 in 10 methadone clinics were not accepting new patients. Canadian clinics offered more timely methadone access than US opioid treatment programs. These results suggest that the methadone access shortage was exacerbated by COVID-19 and that changes to the US opioid treatment program model are needed to improve the timeliness of access.

Methods: Cross-sectional study with 1,587 participants aged 3 to 17 years. Five anthropometric indicators were calculated according to weight, height and waist circumference (WC). Anthropometric measurements and laboratory indicators were used to diagnose CMRFs, which included hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose and abdominal obesity. Partial correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship among anthropometric indicators, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were used to compare the predict ability of each anthropometric indicators, the cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity and Youden Index of each indicator were calculated. Results: In 3-6 years old children, ABSI-adolescent positively correlated with WC (r=0.727, P<0.001), BMI (r=0.218, P<0.001) and WHtR (r=0.752, P<0.001), and in 7-17 years old participants, the correlation coefficients increased to 0.842, 0.563 and 0.850 (P<0.001), respectively. BRI were strong correlated with BMI, WHtR and ABSI-adolescents in both age group (P<0.001). In 3-6 years group, the ROC analysis showed that BMI and ABSI were significantly better in identifying hypertension in both genders, WHtR and BRI were significantly better in identifying abdominal obesity in girls, but all of them were failed in identifying dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. In 7-17 years group, WHtR and BRI were significantly better in identifying hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity in both genders, BMI and ABSI performed better in identifying hyperglycemia in girls. Conclusions: In Chinese children aged 3-6 years, there is no indicator performed best in all the CMRFs, in 7-17 years old teenagers, WHtR and BRI can be recommended to identify hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity and clustered CMRFs in both genders.

Consequently, many authors studied the onset and evolution of the cytokine storm. In contrast, other inflammatory mediators such as oxylipins have received almost no attention. Methods We conducted a monocentric observational and retrospective study (IMPRE-COVID-19) with patients (aged [] 18 years) admitted to Pisa University Hospital with COVID-19 related pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in a nasopharyngeal swab, while pneumonia was demonstrated by CT scan. Oxylipin plasma levels were analysed in a convenient sample of 52 patients randomly selected from those that had a complete set of cytokine values evaluated for clinical purposes. In 12 cases, plasma samples collected on different days were available at the BMS Multispecialistic Biobank of Pisa University Hospital and were analysed to understand the evolution of the oxylipin levels during hospitalization. The two datasets that included oxylipin and cytokine values were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA), computation of Fisher s canonical variable, and a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Findings Between March and April 2020, 52 patients were enrolled of which 28 were hospitalised in COVID-19 wards, 20 in ICUs, and 4 who were initially hospitalised in the wards and who were then transferred to the ICUs due to deteriorating health conditions. Plasma samples collected on different days were available from 7 patients in the wards, 1 from an ICU, and 4 from patients who were hospitalised in both. The mean age of participants was 61 years (SD 16), 11 were females (21%), and 41 were males (79%), without significant differences between groups in terms of age and gender. PCA of oxylipin data led to a clear differentiation of samples collected in COVID-19 wards and ICUs. This differentiation had not been obtained with cytokine data. In addition, borderline samples were from patients hospitalised in COVID-19 wards that were about to be transferred to the ICUs, thus suggesting that differentiation is not a consequence of a different treatment, but somehow related to a diverse evolution of the pathology. Computation of Fisher s canonical variable identified the original input variables that were the most effective in discriminating between the two classes. The combination of the two datasets did not improve the discrimination, thus suggesting that oxylipins are more informative than cytokines for this purpose. A multivariate class model built using the four lowest-order principal components as the input variables, and COVID-19 ward samples as the target class, produced a ROC curve with a resulting area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0{middle dot}92 - which is much higher than most AUC outcomes obtained for individual oxylipins. Interpretation After analysing the metabolic pathways of the most informative oxylipins, we speculate that more severe COVID-19 is associated with a selective deficiency of pro-resolving oxylipins leading to ineffective resolutive mechanisms of inflammation, likely worsened by endothelial damage. We believe that our oxylipin data suggest the possibility to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in individual patients at an early stage.

One primary issue is that they do not consider variation between providers that is outside the providers' control, for example, due to unobserved patient characteristics that vary between providers. In this article, we review the existing fixed- and random-effects methods, and propose a smoothed empirical null approach that accounts for the total variation and adapts to different provider sizes. The linear model with random provider effects provides an illustration of the proposed empirical null method.

We would need to cover 85% of the population (including many 5-16 year-olds to achieve herd immunity). At lower reproduction number of 3 and our current Mixed strategy, we can achieve herd immunity without vaccinating 5-15 year olds.

We also examine the impact of vaccination on death in the event that herd immunity is not achieved. Direct effects of vaccination on reducing death are very good for both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. However we estimate that the Mixed or Pfizer program performs better than the AstraZeneca program. Furthermore, vaccination levels below the herd immunity threshold can lead to substantial (albeit incomplete) indirect protection for both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.

The sudden decline in electricity load demand caused by strict social distancing restrictions has made it difficult for traditional models to forecast the load demand during the pandemic.

First, a knowledge base containing mobility data is constructed, which can reflect the changes in visitor volume in different regions and buildings based on mobile services. Therefore, the sudden decline in load can be analyzed according to the socioeconomic behavior changes during the pandemic. Furthermore, a new transfer deep learning model is proposed to address the problem of limited mobility data associated with the pandemic. Moreover, reinforcement learning is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed model automatically, which avoids the manual adjustment of the hyperparameters, thereby maximizing the forecasting accuracy. To enhance the hyperparameter optimization efficiency of the reinforcement-learning agents, a new advance forecasting method is proposed to forecast the state-action values of the state space that have not been traversed.

Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs).

However, it has been associated with various infections such as liver and brain abscesses, bacteremia, osteo-articular infections, and endocarditis. Since 2005, high throughput genome sequencing methods enabled understanding the genetic landscape and diversity of bacteria as well as their pathogenic role. Here, in order to determine whether specific virulence genes could be related to specific clinical manifestations, we compared the genomes from 27 S. intermedius strains isolated from patients with various types of infections, including 13 that were sequenced in our institute and 14 available in GenBank. RESULTS: We estimated the theoretical pangenome size to be of 4,020 genes, including 1,355 core genes, 1,054 strain-specific genes and 1,611 accessory genes shared by 2 or more strains. The pangenome analysis demonstrated that the genomic diversity of S. intermedius represents an open pangenome model. We identified a core virulome of 70 genes and 78 unique virulence markers. The phylogenetic clusters based upon core-genome sequences and SNPs were independent from disease types and sample sources. However, using Principal Component analysis based on presence/ absence of virulence genes, we identified the sda histidine kinase, adhesion protein LAP and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein cps4E as being associated to brain abscess or broncho-pulmonary infection. In contrast, liver and abdominal abscess were associated to presence of the fibronectin binding protein fbp54 and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein cap8D and cpsB. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the virulence gene content of 27 S. intermedius strains causing various diseases, we identified putative disease-specific genetic profiles discriminating those causing brain abscess or broncho-pulmonary infection from those causing liver and abdominal abscess. These results provide an insight into S. intermedius pathogenesis and highlights putative targets in a diagnostic perspective.","output":"Pangenome analysis and virulence profiling of Streptococcus intermedius"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 emerged towards the end of 2019 which was identified as a global pandemic by the world heath organization (WHO). With the rapid spread of COVID-19, the number of infected and suspected patients has increased dramatically.

However, the huge CT data make it difficult for radiologist to fully exploit them on the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis system that can automatically analyze CT images to distinguish the COVID-19 against to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The proposed system is based on an unsupervised pulmonary opacity detection method that locates opacity regions by a detector unsupervisedly trained from CT images with normal lung tissues. Radiomics based features are extracted insides the opacity regions, and fed into classifiers for classification. We evaluate the proposed CAD system by using 200 CT images collected from different patients in several hospitals.

Among commercial enrollees,  1 condition increased the risk for severe LRTI (1 condition: adjusted relative risk, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-2.78; 3 conditions: adjusted relative risk, 4.85; 95% confidence interval, 4.65-5.07) compared with children with no medical conditions. Using commercial/Medicaid combined rates, an estimated 31289 hospitalizations for severe LRTI occurred each year in children in the United States. CONCLUSIONS Among children, the burden of hospitalization for severe LRTI is greatest among children aged <1 year. Children with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk for severe LRTI hospitalization.","output":"Hospitalizations for severe lower respiratory tract infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new theoretical framework, polarized Fock states (PFS), to describe the coupled molecule-cavity hybrid system in quantum electrodynamics. Through the quantum light-matter interactions under the dipole Gauge, the molecular permanent dipoles polarize the photon field by displacing the photonic coordinate. Hence, it is convenient to use these shifted Fock states (referred to as the PFS) to describe light-matter interactions under the strong coupling regimes. These PFS are non-orthogonal to each other and are light-matter entangled states. They allow an intuitive understanding of several phenomena that go beyond the prediction of the quantum Rabi model, while also offering numerical convenience to converge the results with much fewer states. With this powerful new theoretical framework, we explain how molecular permanent dipoles lead to the generation of multiple photons from a single electronic excitation (downconversion), effectively achieving the dynamical Casimir effect through the nuclear vibration instead of the cavity mirror oscillations.","output":"Polarized Fock States and the Dynamical Casimir Effect in Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the globe in previously unimaginable ways, with far-reaching economic and social implications.

We describe the process and outcomes of a new proactive, virtual nurse-led, resource center navigation model enhanced by using volunteer patient navigators. Using known patient risk factors, this model provides interventions to reduce barriers to care, with an emphasis on non-English-speaking populations. METHODS: Patients were included if they (1) were in active cancer treatment and (2) had one or more known risk factors: distance from cancer hospital, needing complex care, 65 years or older, malignant hematological diagnosis, new treatment start, lives alone, non-English speaker, or a new hospital discharge. Nurse navigators triaged referrals to appropriate team members who identified and addressed barriers to care. RESULTS: The program engaged with 586 adult cancer patients over 1459 encounters. The most common risk factors included distance (59.7%), complex care (48.8%), and new treatment start (43.5%). The most common interventions were core education (69.4%), emotional support (61.2%), and education (35.7%). Statistical differences were found between Spanish-speaking (n = 118) and non-Spanish-speaking patients (n = 468). While Spanish-speaking patients had fewer risk factors (1.95 vs. 2.80, p  .0001), they had nearly double the number of visits (4.27 vs. 2.04, p  .0001) and 69% more interventions (8.26 vs. 4.90, p  .0001). Many patients (42.7%) required follow-up visits. CONCLUSION: We successfully established a new navigation model for the resource center during the pandemic that identified and reduced barriers to care, particularly in the Spanish-speaking population.

Given the risk to human health and the theoretical potential for JEV use as a bioweapon, the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent JEV infection is vital for preserving human health. The development of vaccines for JE began in the 1940s with formalin-inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines. These vaccines have been shown to induce a protective immune response and to be very effective. Mouse brain-derived vaccines were still in use until May 2011 when the last lots of the BIKEN(?)

Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were selected. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t = 2.767, P < 0.010). After treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.231, P > 0.819). The level of lymphocytes in severe/critical patients was lower than that in normal patients (t = 4.636, P < 0.001) before treatment. After treatment, the absolute value of lymphocytes in the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t=1.208, P=0.237).

Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested. The predicted CTL epitopes were then tested to eliminate those with MHC class II binding potential, a property that could induce hyperinflammatory responses mediated by TH2 cells in immunized hosts.

The main aim of this study was to assess public compliance with and support for government-imposed stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with different COVID-19 infection and death rates. Design: In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to nationally representative respondents from April 2-8, 2020. Setting: Regions with different disease prevalence included two nations [the United States (US, high) and Australia (AU, low)] and two cities [New York (NY, high) and Los Angeles (LA, low)]. Participants: For adults 18 years or older residing in specified regions, eligible respondents were empaneled until representative quotas were reached for age, gender, and either race and ethnicity (US, NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), matching the 2010 US or 2016 AU census. Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys (US: 3010; NY: 507; LA: 525; AU: 1531). The median age was 47 years (range, 18-89); 3039 (54.5%) were female.

Main Outcomes Measures: Public compliance with and attitudes regarding government-imposed stay-at-home orders were evaluated and compared between regions. Results: Of 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported compliance with recommended quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Despite significant disruptions of social and work life, health, and behavior, 5022 respondents (90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples, 88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe orders should last at least three more weeks or until public health or government officials recommend, with such support spanning the political spectrum. Conclusions: Public compliance with stringent quarantine and stay-at-home policies was very high, in both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA).

However, questions have been raised about the role and reliability of models. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of combining probabilistic forecasts from multiple models for forecasts of incident and cumulative COVID mortalities. Methods We considered 95% interval and point forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortalities between 16 May 2020 and 8 May 2021 in multiple locations in the United States. We compared the accuracy of simple and more complex combining methods, as well as individual models. Results The average of the forecasts from the individual models was consistently more accurate than the average performance of these models, which provides a fundamental motivation for combining. Weighted combining performed well for both incident and cumulative mortalities, and for both interval and point forecasting. Inverse score with tuning was the most accurate method overall. The median combination was a leading method in the last quarter for both mortalities, and it was consistently more accurate than the mean combination for point forecasting of both mortalities. For interval forecasts of cumulative mortality, the mean performed better than the median. The leading individual models were most competitive for point forecasts of incident mortality. Conclusions We recommend that harnessing the wisdom of the crowd can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting of epidemics to health policy decision making, and report that the relative performance of the different combining methods depends on several factors including the type of data, type of forecast and timing.","output":"Harnessing the Wisdom of the Crowd to Forecast Incident and Cumulative COVID-19 Mortality in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) production is one of the crucial responses in innate immunity upon infection with viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and is modulated by both viral and host cellular proteins. Among host proteins involved, we identified tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) as a positive regulator of porcine NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 production. TRIM25 achieved this function by enhancing the pro-caspase-1 interaction with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain (ASC).

These results support the notion that clinical disease in coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis results from a balance between factors critical for virus clearance, such as virus-specific effector T cells and anti-inflammatory elements, such as Tregs. These findings also show that unlike chronic infections, in which an excessive number of Tregs contributes to pathogen persistence, Tregs in the setting of acute encephalitis may help to limit immunopathological disease without delaying virus clearance.","output":"Role of Regulatory T Cells in Coronavirus-Induced Acute Encephalitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world's population has been evolving rapidly; every country in the world is facing this drastic progression in the number and the percentage of the elderly in their net population. As the chronological age advances, physiological and psychosocial decline will be evident among all older adults. The potentially relevant literature was identified using appropriate search terms in electronic databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, CINAHL, IndMed, and Google Scholar. Articles published from 2006 to 2019, reported the prevalence and the risk factors for depression among older adults living in the community, old age homes, or hospitals of the South Asian countries. Articles were published in the languages other than English and those reporting the categorised or mean depressive scores were excluded from the review. After quality check for all the retrieved articles from different databases, 120 articles were included for the meta-analysis. The data were extracted based on a validated data extraction form, and the reviewer contacted the authors for clarification of the missing data whenever required. The estimates were pooled using the random effect model for meta-analyses. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were also performed. The overall pooled estimate (random effect models) of the prevalence of depression among the elderly was 42.0% (95% CI: 0.38-0.46), Chi-squared P-value <0.001, and I2 99.14%. The pooled estimate of the prevalence was higher in the community settings than the old age homes (44.0%; 95% CI: 39.0-49.0 vs. 42.0%; 95% CI: 34.0-49.0). Depression is a common problem among the elderly population and the pooled estimate of depression would give directions to the healthcare providers, policymakers, and future researchers to plan some measures (either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions) to effectively tackle the burden of geriatric depression in the future.","output":"Depression among older adults: a systematic review of South Asian countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Western literature, employment relations/human resource management (ERs/HRM) is a widely debated area.

The risk to restarting activities is unknown. Objective Assess the risk of SARS-Cov-2 virus contagion, both to patients and healthcare workers in relation to esophageal and anorectal functional tests during the pandemic without protective measures. Method A questionnaire was designed to find out whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed either by a test or only compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. Results 263 (92.9%) patients answered the survey. In the two weeks after functional test, four (1.52%) patients had confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 (95% CI -0.06-16.74), OR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83-0.85), p<0.001), no one after anorectal manometry. Other five had only compatible symptoms, total 9 (3.42%) (adjusted rate 27.50 cases / 1,000 (95% CI: 7.27-47.74), OR 2.84 (95% CI: 2.81-2.87).

The average of days between the procedure and the first day of symptoms was progressively shortened: January 56 days, February 33 days, March 10.5 days. Two out of 10 healthcare workers (20%) were confirmed with COVID-19. Conclusions The risk of COVID-19 contagion when performing functional tests is low and more related to the evolution of the pandemic than to the procedures themselves. The small number of healthcare workers included in the study does not allow a definitive conclusion to be drawn on their risk of contagion.","output":"Risk of COVID-19 transmission in esophageal, anorectal manometry, and 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and profound dysregulation of the thrombotic/fibrinolytic pathway, with thrombotic complications common in affected patients (pts). Fibrin deposition may be a key feature of the pathobiology, with markedly elevated levels of PAI-1 reported. Defibrotide (DF), a polyanionic naturally-derived polydeoxyribonucelotide with endothelial stabilizing activity, has fibrinolytic, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties, with known activity in reducing PAI-1 levels and inhibiting heparanase. We now report a prospective, open label, safety and tolerability trial of defibrotide for the management of patients with advanced SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients (pts) were 18 years in age, with clinical and radiographic signs of ARDS, no signs of active bleeding, a serum D-Dimer > 2X ULN, and a positive PCR-based assay for SARS-CoV-2. Concomitant use of systemic anticoagulants or fibrinolytics was initially precluded, with the study amended to allow prophylactic doses of systemic heparin in its latter stages. Defibrotide (6.25 mg/kg/dose IV q. 6 hours) was administered for a planned 7-day course, with day 1 defined as the first day of study therapy. Therapy was able to be discontinued prior to day 7 in pts who met the pulmonary response parameter at that earlier timepoint. Patients with a partial response to therapy (> 20% reduction in FiO2) by day 7 were allowed to receive an additional 7 days of therapy (14 days total). Response was defined as complete cessation of supplemental O2 support, or  2 point reduction in WHO ordinal score for 48 consecutive hours by day 7. Patients were recruited from a single center between October 2020 and March 2021. Results: Twelve pts (median 63 years, range 35-73 years) were treated, with 10 of 12 pts on mechanical ventilation (median FiO2 55%, PEEP 18 mmHg), and six on vasopressor support at the time of study entry. Baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratios ranged from 82 - 200 mmHg. The median D-Dimer was 3.25 mcg/ml (range 1.33-12.3 mcg/ml), and fibrinogen 637 mg/dl (range 250-1208 mg/dl) at study entry. Dexamethasone and remdesivir had been administered prior to DF in all pts, with no other SARS-CoV-2 targeted treatment given during DF therapy. Eleven pts received 7 days of therapy, with one pt receiving 14 days. The first 9 pts received DF without other concomitant anticoagulants, with the last 3 pts concurrently receiving prophylactic heparin plus DF. No hemorrhagic or bleeding complications occurred during DF therapy, including the 3 pts receiving concurrent heparin prophylaxis. Likewise, no thrombotic complications developed during study therapy, including the 9 patients in which DF was their sole anti-coagulant. All 12 patients were evaluable for response. Four pts met the day 7 pulmonary response parameter, with 2 pts having a complete cessation of O2 support within this period. Three pts died from progressive pulmonary disease, at 11, 17 and 34 days from study entry. The 3 pts (who died) had the lowest baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratios (82-115 mmHg) of all study subjects. Nine pts (75%) remain alive, 64 to 174 days from study entry, all 9 discharged from their primary hospitalization. Day 30 all-cause mortality was 17% (95%CI: 0-35%). Serial coagulation and fibrinolytic assays were available in 7 patients. Total PAI-1 levels decreased from a median 167 ng/ml (range 105-264 ng/ml) to a median 104 ng/ml (range 55-166 ng/ml) by day 4 of therapy, with all 7 subjects showing a decline in PAI-1 levels at that time point. Total tPA levels increased from a median 3.02 ng/ml (range 0.72 - 36.1 ng/ml) at baseline to 4.5 ng/ml (range 1.1-8.2 ng/ml) by day 4 in study subjects. Allowing for the small sample size, baseline PAI-1, tPA or D-Dimer levels did not impact response. One of two patients with a baseline D-Dimer > 10 mcg/ml responded, while both patients with a baseline D-Dimer <2.0 mcg/ml failed to meet the response parameter. Conclusion: The use of DF for the management of SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS proved safe and tolerable in a prospective, open label trial. No hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications were reported during therapy. Outcomes were promising, including an overall survival of 75% in a patient population with a historically high mortality rate.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is considered as the revisional procedure of choice. However, revisional bariatric surgery is associated with relatively higher rates of complications. The aim of the current study is to analyse our single-centre experience with patients requiring revisional RYGB following primary VBG. METHODS Retrospective review of the prospectively collected database identified 153 patients who underwent RYGB as a revisional procedure after VBG from Feb 2004-Feb 2011. Early and late complications, weight data and resolution of symptoms related to gastric outlet obstruction were analysed. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three females and 30 males underwent revisional RYGB post VBG. Mean age was 44.4 (15-74) years with a mean pre-operative body mass index (BMI) of 34.2 (23.5-65.5) kg/m(2). Mean hospital stay was 4.3 days. Early complication rate was 3.9 % with a 30-day re-operation rate of 1.3 %. Mortality and leak rate were zero. After a mean follow-up of 48 months, the mean BMI decreased significantly to 28.8 kg/m(2) and a complete resolution of the obstructive symptoms was achieved in nearly all patients. Late complications developed in 11 (7.7 %) of the patients of which seven (4.9 %) required surgery. CONCLUSIONS Revisional RYGB following VBG is technically challenging but safe with low rates of morbidity and mortality, comparable to primary RYGB. It produces a significant reduction in body weight and in symptoms resolution.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, thorax computed tomographic (CT) findings have played a crucial role in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we compared the thorax CT findings of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants (variant group) with those of patients infected with the non-variant strain (non-variant group) to assess if thorax CT findings may be utilized to discriminate between the groups. Furthermore, we compared demographic and laboratory data between the groups. Methods The study comprised a total of 77 patients who presented to our hospital with a preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical symptoms, a positive oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing, and thorax CT examinations. Patients' laboratory and demographic features as well as thorax CT findings were retrospectively evaluated, and the results were grouped according to RT-PCR results. Results There were 42 patients in the non-variant group and 35 patients in the variant group. The average age of patients infected with the non-variant strain, alpha variant, and gamma variant was 63.5214.87 years, 54.8614.31 years, and 59.417.79 years, respectively. The average age of the variant group was significantly lower than that of the non-variant group. There was no significant difference in thorax CT findings between the groups, and consolidation, ground glass densities, and cobblestone pattern in the bilateral lower lobes and peripheral areas were the most common thorax CT findings in both the groups. Conclusion There is no significant difference in thorax CT findings between the variant and non-variant groups. Therefore, clinical and laboratory characteristics should take precedence over thorax CT findings for distinguishing between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants and the non-variant strain.","output":"Evaluation of thorax computed tomographic findings in COVID-19 variant cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical research studies reporting on post-COVID-19 syndrome should follow some basic recommendations","output":"Nefer, Sinuhe and clinical research assessing post-COVID-19 syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper starts with a review of the secondary literature published in English about the strengths and weaknesses of the web-based learning tools available in museum systems as brought forward by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

OBJECTIVE: In this 30-month study, we propose to develop an in-clinic, youth-tailored, vaccine-promoting intervention for vaccine hesitancy reduction that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing environments of pediatric and family practice settings in rural Alabama. METHODS: This exploratory, sequential mixed methods study will be conducted in 3 phases. In the first phase, we will assess stakeholders knowledge, sentiments, and beliefs related to vaccination in general, COVID-19 vaccination, and human papillomavirus vaccination. We will also assess stakeholders perceptions of barriers to vaccination that exist in rural Alabama. This will be followed by a second phase wherein we will use the data collected in the first phase to inform the development and finalization of a noninvasive, modular, synchronous counseling intervention that targets the behaviors of 15- to 26-year-old adolescents. In the third phase, we will conduct a pilot hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized controlled trial to assess intervention acceptability and feasibility (clinics: N=4; African American youth: N=120) while assessing a clinical signal of effectiveness.

Home-confinement and primary care phone follow-ups was the first-level regional policy for preventing EDs to collapse. But when ppCOVID-19 needed x-rays assessment, the traditional outpatient workflow at the radiology department (RD) was inefficient and raised concerns about potential interpersonal infections. We aimed to assess the efficiency of a primary care high-resolution radiology service (pcHRRS) for ppCOVID-19 in terms of time consumed at hospital and decisions reliability. Methods: We assessed 849 consecutive ppCOVID-19 patients, 418 appointed by general practitioners to the pcHRRS (home-confined ppCOVID-19 cases with negative Cgroup-1- and positive -group-2- x-ray results) and 431 arriving the ED by themselves (group-3). The pcHRRS provided x-rays and oximetry in an only-one-patient agenda for home-confined ppCOVID-19 patients. Radiologists made next-step decisions (group-1: pneumonia-, home-confinement follow-up;group-2: pneumonia+, ED assessment) according to x-rays results. ANOVA and Bonferroni correction, t-student, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi2 tests were used to analyse changes in the ED workload, time-to-decision differences between groups, and pcHRRS performance for discriminating need for admission. Results: The pcHRRS halved ED respiratory patients (49.2%), allowed faster decisions (group-1 vs. home-discharged group-2 and group-3 patients: 0:411:05h vs. 3:503:16h;group-1 vs. all group-2 and group-3 patients: 0:411:05h vs. 5:364:36h;group-2 vs. group-3 admitted patients: 5:273:08h vs. 7:425:02h;P <0.001) and prompted admission in most cases (84/93, 90.3%).

We investigated the association between receipt of tocilizumab and mortality in a large cohort of hospitalized patients. METHODS: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain, the primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time-varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between receipt of tocilizumab and outcome. RESULTS: Data from 1229 patients were analysed, with 261 patients (61 deaths) in the tocilizumab group and 969 patients (120 deaths) in the control group. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between receipt of tocilizumab and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.72, p 0.005) and ICU admission or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.80, p 0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L but not among those with CRP &#8804;150 mg/L.

Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.

The purpose of the current study was to predict a library of phytochemicals derived from diverse plant families with high binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 helicase (Nsp13) enzyme. High throughput virtual screening of the Medicinal Plant Database for Drug Design (MPD3) database was performed on SARS-CoV-2 helicase using AutoDock Vina. Nilotinib, with a docking value of ?9.6 kcal/mol, was chosen as a reference molecule. A compound (PubChem CID: 110143421, ZINC database ID: ZINC257223845, eMolecules: 43290531) was screened as the best binder (binding energy of ?10.2 kcal/mol on average) to the enzyme by using repeated docking runs in the screening process. On inspection, the compound was disclosed to show different binding sites of the triangular pockets collectively formed by Rec1A, Rec2A, and 1B domains and a stalk domain at the base. The molecule is often bound to the ATP binding site (referred to as binding site 2) of the helicase enzyme. The compound was further discovered to fulfill drug-likeness and lead-likeness criteria, have good physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties, and to be non-toxic. Molecular dynamic simulation analysis of the control/lead compound complexes demonstrated the formation of stable complexes with good intermolecular binding affinity. Lastly, affirmation of the docking simulation studies was accomplished by estimating the binding free energy by MMPB/GBSA technique.

Protomer with the up-conformational form of RBD, which binds with hACE2, exhibits higher intermolecular interactions at the RBD-ACE2 interface, with differential distributions and the inclusion of specific H-bonds in the CoV-2 complex. Further interface analysis has shown that interfacial water promotes and stabilizes the formation of CoV-2/hACE2 complex.

The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. RESULTS: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program.

Approaches that improve antibody responses to conserved B cell epitopes have increased the protective efficacy of vaccines within a subtype or phylogenetic group of influenza viruses. Vaccines that elicit significant levels of T cells recognizing highly conserved viral epitopes possess a high cross-protective potential and may cover most circulating influenza viruses. However, the development of T cell-based universal influenza vaccines is challenging owing to the diversity of MHCs in the population, unpredictable degree of immunodominance, lack of adequate animal models, and difficulty in establishing T cell immunity in humans.","output":"Influenza vaccine: progress in a vaccine that elicits a broad immune response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), there is a lack of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This study assesses the use of serum calprotectin (sCal) as a marker to monitor disease activity, and as a classification and prognosis tool of response to treatment or risk of flares in patients with JIA. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with JIA from the CAP48 multicentric cohort were included in this study, as well as 11 non-paediatric healthy controls. An ELISA method was used to quantify sCal with a commercial kit. RESULTS: Patients with an active disease compared with healthy controls and with patients with inactive disease showed an eightfold and a twofold increased level of sCal, respectively. sCal was found to be correlated with the C-reactive protein (CRP) and even more strongly with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Evolution of DAS28 scores correlated well with evolution of sCal, as opposed to evolution of CRP. With regard to CRP, sCal could differentiate forms with active oligoarthritis from polyarthritis and systemic forms. However, sCal brought an added value compared with the CRP as a prognosis marker. Indeed, patients with active disease and reaching minimal disease activity (according to Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score) at 6 months following the test had higher sCal levels, while patients with inactive disease had higher sCal levels if a flare was observed up to 3C9 months following the test.

METHODS: We analyzed the transcriptomes of 605,904 single cells isolated from healthy (79 samples) and diseased human lungs (31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 82 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 18 non-IPF interstitial lung disease samples). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cellular distribution and relative expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, TMPRSS2) was similar in disease and control lungs. Epithelial cells isolated from diseased lungs expressed higher levels of genes linked directly to efficiency of viral replication and the innate immune response. Unique ACE2-correlated gene sets were identified for each diagnosis group in the type II alveolar cells. Diseased lungs have a significant increase in the proportion of CD4, CD8 and NK cells compared to control lungs. Components of the interferon pathway, the IL6 cytokine pathway and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are upregulated in several diseased immune cell types. These differences in inflammatory gene expression programs highlight how chronic lung disease alters the inflammatory microenvironment encountered upon viral exposure to the peripheral lung. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic lung disease is accompanied by changes in cell-type-specific gene expression programs that prime the lung epithelium for and influence innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals dysregulation of molecular programs associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity and outcomes in patients with chronic lung disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long COVID is seen in a growing group of patients who experience a large number of symptoms after previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Synthetic DNA aptamers are easy to generate, inexpensive, highly specific and have been postulated to replace antibodies for research and clinical use. Despite the considerable amount of published work on the use of DNA aptamers for research use, to date they have not been exploited for clinical diagnostics. SARS-CoV-2 virus is a pandemic causing a global disruptive event preventing people from travel, work and leisure activities resulting in a major health crisis, hospital overloads and a high death rate. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in communities is therefore very important, especially for returning normality of life. The current gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus is RT-PCR, a technique that is relatively expensive and most importantly with a slow turnaround time between sample procurement and result. This paper describes the development of a rapid, accurate, low-cost, facile to use assay for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in saliva. The assay exploits a simple system based on the use of a gold nanoparticle-aptamer complex, that can be easily produced and distributed, facilitating its deployment to the point-of-need, potentially reaching millions of individuals in resource-limited settings. The proposed colorimetric diagnostic test kit uses a SARS-CoV-2 DNA aptamer adsorbed on gold nanoparticles and salt-induced aggregation to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in saliva samples indicated by a color change of the gold absorbance spectrum that can be quantified by a spectrophotometer, linked to a mobile phone for data processing and analysis. The assay parameters were optimized and then tested in a field calibration clinical test in Indonesia. At a research level, a limit of detection of ca. 1.25 nM to synthetic spike protein (S1) was observed and a method to test human saliva samples developed. The DNA aptamer was specific to SARS-CoV-2, with minor cross-reactivity observed with MERS and SARS-CoV-1, but negligible cross-reactivity seen with common cold coronaviruses. A calibration clinical test of patients in Indonesia demonstrated a classification resulting in a > 97% sensitivity and a > 97% specificity compared with saliva RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the data indicates that anatomical location and sample type (swab vs saliva) can affect RT-PCR results. In conclusion, we have developed the use of a robust and reproducible aptamer-gold nanoparticle assay for clinical diagnostic use based on a colorimetric system that is cheap, simple, rapid, sensitive and can be employed for large scale testing of human populations for SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"DNA Aptamer Gold Nanoparticle Colorimetric Diagnostic Test Kit of Saliva Samples for SARS-CoV-2 Virus Linked to Mobile Phone Application (AptamexTM)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-like particles are an emerging class of nano-biotechnology with the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) having found a wide range of applications in imaging, drug delivery, and vaccine development. TMV is typically produced in planta, and, as an RNA virus, is highly susceptible to natural mutation that may impact its properties. Over the course of 2 years, from 2018 until 2020, our laboratory followed a spontaneous point mutation in the TMV coat proteinfirst observed as a 30 Da difference in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESICMS). The mutation would have been difficult to notice by electrophoretic mobility in agarose or SDS-PAGE and does not alter viral morphology as assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The mutation responsible for the 30 Da difference between the wild-type (wTMV) and mutant (mTMV) coat proteins was identified by a bottom-up proteomic approach as a change from glycine to serine at position 155 based on collision-induced dissociation data. Since residue 155 is located on the outer surface of the TMV rod, it is feasible that the mutation alters TMV surface chemistry. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays found no difference in binding between mTMV and wTMV. Functionalization of a nearby residue, tyrosine 139, with diazonium salt, also appears unaffected. Overall, this study highlights the necessity of standard workflows to quality-control viral stocks.

RECENT FINDINGS: Commonly reported neurologic complications include toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disorders, seizures, and anoxic-brain injury. These complications represent secondary injury due to COVID-19 related hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulability, or hyperinflammation. Postinfectious complications, such as encephalitis, postinfectious demyelination, and Guillain-Barr syndrome have been reported, but are rare. Recent reports of persistent neurocognitive symptoms highlight the possibility of lasting impairment. SUMMARY: Although some neurologic complications should be treated with standard practices, further investigations are still needed to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-related neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke. Entering into the next phase of the pandemic, investigations into the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be needed.

In this period, the web interest in the novel coronavirus has undergone a drastic surge. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze quantitatively the impact of COVID-19 on web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects, as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic. We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian web user in the international, national, and regional COVID-19 situation. By doing so, from the analysis of web searches, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population. Methods: To conduct this research we used the \\"Google Trends\\" tool, which returns normalized values, called \\"relative search volume\\" (RSV), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the web popularity of a group of queries. By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being. Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations {rho} ; between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region. We chose a p-value (p) threshold =.1. Results: After the two initial spikes that occurred on February 23 and March 9, 2020, the general web interest in COVID-19 in Italy has waned, as has the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p< .1 only until March 14, 2020). Anyway, web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (ASV=92,SD=6). We also found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at national but not international nor regional level. Between 20 February and 10 June, 2020, web interest relating to hygiene and prevention increased by 116 and 901% respectively compared to those from 1 January to 19 February, 2020 (95% CIs: [115.3,116.3],[850.3,952,2]). Significant correlations between regional cumulative web searches and COVID-19 cases were found only between February 26 and March 7, 2020 ({rho}-best= .43, 95% CI:[.42.44],p= .07). During the COVID-19 pandemic until 10 June, 2020, national web searches of the generic terms \\"fear\\" and \\"anxiety\\" grew by 8 and 21% respectively (95% CIs: [8.0,8.2],[20.4,20.6]) compared to those of the period 1 January, 2018 - 29 December, 2019. We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data. Conclusions: The Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem. In general, web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region; we conclude that the danger, once it arrived in the country, was perceived similarly in all regions. We can state that the period of maximum effectiveness of the online information, in relation to this type of situation, is limited to 3-4 days from a specific key event. If such a scenario were to occur again, we suggest that all government agencies focus their web disclosure efforts over that time. Despite this, we have found cyclical correlations with research related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress. Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related web queries.

One possibility to improve distance learning can be the use of virtual reality (VR). To this day there are no common guidelines for educators for using VR, and therefore no recommendations to decide which platform to use and what specific requirements they entail. This paper presents an evaluation of currently available proprietary social VR platforms for the use in distance learning. Based on results of expert interviews (n= 4 ) with educators and an online survey (n= 92 ) of students, we identified ten relevant criteria for teaching in VR. We compiled a list of 155 currently available proprietary social VR platforms, which we filtered and evaluated. The results indicate that current social VR platforms can provide an easy and affordable way for educators to access the usage of VR in education, although we could not determine a single best social VR platform. Our recommendations rather provide different most suitable platforms for particular learning applications depending to respective educational requirements. Our research provides a guideline for interested educators in order to find an affordable entry into the usage of VR in education.

Design: Two-sample MR analysis. Setting: Summary statistics from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) consortia. Participants: 681,275 participants in GIANT and more than 2.5 million people from the COVID-19 HGI consortia. Exposure: Genetically instrumented BMI. Main outcome measures: Seven case/control definitions for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity: very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 vs not hospitalised COVID-19 (A1) and vs population (those who were never tested, tested negative or had unknown testing status (A2)); hospitalised COVID-19 vs not hospitalised COVID-19 (B1) and vs population (B2); COVID-19 vs lab/self-reported negative (C1) and vs population (C2); and predicted COVID-19 from self-reported symptoms vs predicted or self-reported non-COVID-19 (D1). Results: With the exception of A1 comparison, genetically higher BMI was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in all comparison groups, with odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.11 (95%CI: 0.94, 1.32) for D1 to 1.57 (95%CI: 1.57 (1.39, 1.78) for A2. As a method to assess selection bias, we found no strong evidence of an effect of COVID-19 on BMI in a 'no-relevance' analysis, in which COVID-19 was considered the exposure, although measured after BMI. We found evidence of genetic correlation between COVID-19 outcomes and potential predictors of selection determined a priori (smoking, education, and income), which could either indicate selection bias or a causal pathway to infection. Results from multivariable MR adjusting for these predictors of selection yielded similar results to the main analysis, suggesting the latter. Conclusions: We have proposed a set of analyses for exploring potential selection and misclassification bias in MR studies of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 and demonstrated this with an illustrative example. Although selection by socioeconomic position and related traits is present, MR results are not substantially affected by selection/misclassification bias in our example.

Although there are a few therapeutic strategies for DLBCL, most of them are more effective in limited-stage cancer patients. The prognosis of patients with advanced-stage DLBCL is usually poor with frequent recurrence and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression and network differences between limited- and advanced-stage DLBCL patients, with the goal of identifying potential agents that could be used to relieve the severity of DLBCL. Specifically, RNA sequencing data of DLBCL patients at different clinical stages were collected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2, and then, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and differential module analysis were performed to find variations between different stages. In addition, important genes were extracted by key driver analysis, and potential agents for DLBCL were identified according to gene-expression perturbations and the Crowd Extracted Expression of Differential Signatures (CREEDS) drug signature database. As a result, 20 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated genes were identified and 79 gene co-expression modules were found using WGCNA, among which, the thistle1 module was highly related to the clinical stage of DLBCL. KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses of genes in the thistle1 module indicated that DLBCL progression was mainly related to the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, neutrophil activation, secretory granule membrane, and carboxylic acid binding. A total of 47 key drivers were identified through key driver analysis with 11 up-regulated key driver genes and 36 down-regulated key diver genes in advanced-stage DLBCL patients. Five genes (MMP1, RAB6C, ACCSL, RGS21 and MOCOS) appeared as hub genes, being closely related to the occurrence and development of DLBCL. Finally, both differentially expressed genes and key driver genes were subjected to CREEDS analysis, and 10 potential agents were predicted to have the potential for application in advanced-stage DLBCL patients. In conclusion, we propose a novel pipeline to utilize perturbed gene-expression signatures during DLBCL progression for identifying agents, and we successfully utilized this approach to generate a list of promising compounds.","output":"Agent Repurposing for the Treatment of Advanced Stage Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Based on Gene Expression and Network Perturbation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index predicts 30-day all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 using age, sex and pre-existing comorbidity diagnoses.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 positive patients after recovery in Bangladesh. This was a study of adult (aged 18 years) COVID-19 individuals from eight divisions of Bangladesh diagnosed and confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from June 2020 to November 2020. Given a response rate of 60% in a pilot study, a random list of 6400 COVID-19 patients was generated to recruit approximately 3200 patients from eight divisions of Bangladesh and finally a total of 3244 participants could be recruited for the current study. The validated Bangla version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Data were analyzed by STATA (Version 16.1) and R (Version 4.0.0). All the procedures were conducted following ethical approval and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean scores of QoL were highest for the physical domain (68.2514.45) followed by social (65.1015.78), psychological (63.2815.48), and environmental domain (62.7713.07). Psychological and physical domain scores among females were significantly lower than the males (p<0.001). The overall quality of life was lower in persons having a chronic disease. Participants over 45 years of age were 52% less likely to enjoy good physical health than the participants aged below 26 years (AOR: 0.48, CI: 0.28C0.82). The quality of life of employed participants was found 1.8 times higher than the unemployed (AOR: 1.80, CI: 1.11C2.91). Those who were admitted to hospitals during infection had a low QoL score in physical, psychological, and socials domains. However, QoL improved in all aspect except the psychological domain for each day passed after the diagnosis. These findings call for a focus on the quality of life of the COVID-19 affected population, with special emphasis given to females, older adults, unemployed, and people with comorbidities.","output":"Quality of life of COVID-19 recovered patients in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s43450-020-00095-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.","output":"Chemistry and Pharmacology of Alkylamides from Natural Origin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever Most patients recover from COVID-19 within a few weeks, but some patients have symptoms lasting for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cough This is a review of what we currently know about the clinical disease and its severity as well as which diagnostic strategies are recommended during and after hospital admission","output":"[Diagnostic approach and evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid19 pandemic has imposed risks to healthcare delivery for all cancer pts including young adults diagnosed with a GCT. Here, we examine Emergency EP (EmEP, Cohort A) and a novel 1-day Escalateddose EP (EscEP, Cohort B) administered every 2 weeks as upfront or first-relapse therapy to minimise hospital days. Methods: Single-centre analysis in GCT pts receiving emergency and routine chemotherapy following our first National lockdown on 23 March 2020. In Cohort A, eligible pts receive EmEP E100mg/m2 , P20mg/m2 prior to EscEP within the acute setting as previously defined. In Cohort B, EscEP E500mg/m2 , P60mg/m2 is compared to standard care chemotherapy BEP or POMB-ACE. Data collection includes demographics, treatment details, clinical outcome and Covid19 complications. Results: To date, we have accrued 19 pts with a median age 32 (range 18 to 65). In Cohort A, 7 pts with symptomatic high-volume disease received a median 1 cycle EmEP, 6/7 for a new GCT diagnosis and 1/7 for a first relapse, including 2 males with IGCCCG intermediate-prognosis disease, 5 females with FIGO Stage III (n = 2) and IV (n = 3) disease. One pt required higher-level support for organ dysfunction at presentation. In Cohort B, 19 pts including 7 pts from Cohort A received a median 4 cycles EscEP: 8 males (2 seminomas, 6 nonseminomas;IGCCCG good-prognosis in 4, intermediate-prognosis in 2, poor-prognosis in 2), 11 females (1 dysgerminoma, 10 nondysgerminomas;FIGO Stage Ic in 6, III in 2, IV in 3). A majority (14/19, 74%) received EscEP for a new cancer diagnosis, 5/19 (26%) for a first relapse. Total median hospital stay: EscEP 5 days, BEP 21 days, POMB-ACE 28 days. Grade 3/4 neutropenic events: EscEP 28%, BEP 50%, POMB-ACE 43%. From April 2020, 16/16 pts were SARS-CoV-2 screened prior to each cycle: 3/19 (16%) testing positive, one prior to intubation and ventilation, 2 with asymptomatic infection.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the selective  2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine on the pulmonary function of patients who underwent mitral valve surgery using the totally thoracoscopic technique. Methods Fifty-seven patients who underwent thoracoscopic mitral valve surgery between July 2019 and December 2019 were selected. The patients were randomly divided into the control (Con) group (n = 28) and the dexmedetomidine (DEX) group (n = 29) using the random number table method. Arterial blood gas analyses were performed, and the oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) and respiratory indexes (P(A-a)O/PaO2) were calculated 5 min after tracheal intubation (T1), 2 h after operation (T2), 6 h after operation (T3), and 24 h after operation (T4). Moreover, the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent method at all time points. Chest radiography was performed 24 h after surgery. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after the operation for a complete hemogram. Additionally, the procalcitonin concentration was measured and recorded when the patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU). The postoperative extubation time, length of ICU stay, and pulmonary infection rate were also recorded. Results Inflammatory reaction after surgery was evident. However, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-, and ICAM-1 in the DEX group were lower than those in the Con group after surgery (T2 to T4; P < 0.05). Neutrophil counts and procalcitonin concentration were higher in the Con group than in the DEX group (P < 0.05). In addition, in the DEX group, pulmonary exudation on chest radiography was lower, and pulmonary function, as shown by an increase in oxidation index and decrease in the respiratory index, improved after surgery (P < 0.05). Moreover, the duration of mechanical ventilation in the Con group was 3.4 h longer than that in the DEX group. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine has a protective effect on pulmonary function in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery using a totally video-assisted thoracoscopic technique, which may be related to a reduction in the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in the early perioperative period.","output":"Dexmedetomidine Improves Lung Function by Promoting Inflammation Resolution in Patients Undergoing Totally Thoracoscopic Cardiac Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the current status of infection control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitals of different levels, providing strategies and suggestions for occupational infection prevention Methods The frontline health workers of hospitals of different levels were selected to finish the questionnaire survey by WeChat from Mar 2 to 9, 2020 The questionnaire was designed with \\"questionnaire star\\", including the basic information of health workers, the protection knowledge, the working environment against the epidemic, the management of medical protective products and the implementation of protective measures","output":"Prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 in community health service centers and tertiary hospitals in Shanghai: a survey of current situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big Data applications are widely used in many fields such as artificial intelligence, marketing, commercial applications and health care, as demonstrated by the role of Big Data in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic Therefore, it is essential to ensure the quality of the generation and use of Big Data applications Consequently, Big Data applications must satisfy quality factors suited for these applications Furthermore, quality frameworks need to be applied and tested for the quality factors of Big Data applications Nevertheless, the quality measurement process needs to overcome some challenges for it to become applicable and trustworthy This research lists different quality factors and dimensions and describes quality frameworks that are commonly used to measure the quality of Big Data Furthermore, it lists the frequent challenges that researchers and data scientists face throughout the Big Data quality measurement process Finally, it outlines the solutions that need to be developed for confronting the challenges of Big Data quality ? 2020 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR) All rights reserved","output":"Big data quality factors, frameworks and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate medical student and attending surgeon experiences with a novel interactive virtual Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) medical student elective during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The inequalities among Amazon areas challenge the expansion of high-tech services and limit the implementation of active laboratory surveillance to effectively avoid outbreaks in human and non-human hosts, which also reproduces a panorama of vulnerability in risk communities.

However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice. METHODS: The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%. CONCLUSION: In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases.","output":"Utilization and Results of Repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Testing in a Presumptive Low Prevalence Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular imprinting polymers (MIPs) have shown their potential in various applications including pharmaceuticals, chemical sensing and biosensing, medical diagnosis, and environmental related issues, owing to their artificial selective biomimetic recognition ability.

This paper proposes a method to estimate the share of these jobs. For each occupation, we obtain a WFH friendly measure by asking respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate whether the corresponding tasks can be performed from home based on the descriptions from the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO-08) standard. The share of WFH friendly jobs in an economy can then be estimated by combining these measures with the labor statistics on occupational employments. Using Norway as an illustrating example, we find that approximately 38% of Norwegian jobs can be performed from home. The Norwegian results also suggest that the pandemic and the governments attempts to mitigate this crisis may have a quite uneven impact on the working population.

Recent guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources such as mechanical ventilation during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of three severity scoring systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS, SOFA) across ethnic groups in two large ICU databases in order to identify possible ethnicity-based bias.Method: Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care were analysed for score performance in Asians, African Americans, Hispanics and Whites after appropriate exclusions. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups.Finding: While measurements of discrimination - area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) - were significantly different among the groups, they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration - standardised mortality ratio (SMR) - indicated persistent, and in some cases significant, patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites. The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically significant. While calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently demonstrated a pattern of over-predicting mortality for African Americans and Hispanics.Interpretation:The systematic differences in calibration across ethnic groups suggest that illness severity scores reflect bias in their predictions of mortality.Funding Statement: Funding: LAC is funded by the National Institute of Health through NIBIB R01 EB017205.

In recent times, there has been an emphasis on safe school re-opening. This concept is likely to differ between developed and developing country settings. There are however no published studies on barriers hindering safe school re-opening within developing country contexts. This study evaluates aspects of the school health program (SHP) in some selected Nigerian schools that might relate to the pandemic control during school re-opening. METHODS: In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the SHP of 146 registered primary schools in Gwagwalada Area Council in Abuja, Nigeria. These schools provided services to about 54,562 students. We used direct observational methods and interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess the SHP of each school. We compare SHP characteristics that might relate to COVID-19 control in schools across government-owned (public) and privately-owned (private) schools using a pre-defined framework. RESULTS: Public school to pupil ratios was more than six times that of private schools. Only 6.9% of all surveyed schools employed qualified health personnel. Although 8 in every 10 schools conducted health talks for communicable disease control, the use of temporary isolation and school-based immunization were low at 1.4 and 2.7% respectively. Pipe-borne water access was present in 4 of 10 schools, with public schools having more limited access than private schools (p = 0.009). Similarly, less proportion of public schools had access to soap for handwashing (p < 0.001). Adequate classroom ventilation was present in 63% of surveyed schools, with private schools having more limited ventilation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overcrowding and infrastructural deficits within developing country contexts represent barriers to safe school re-opening during the COVID-19 pandemic. In these settings, there needs to be tailored and innovative strategies which consider local practical realities when designing the COVID-19 control programs during school re-opening.","output":"A pre-COVID-19 assessment of aspects of the school health programme in some selected Nigerian primary schools: implications for school re-opening during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing country contexts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The assessment and management of patients with known, or suspected, paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) has been hugely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic Although current evidence of the impact of COVID-19 infection in children with PIBD has provided a degree of reassurance, there continues to be the potential for significant secondary harm caused by the changes to normal working practices and reorganisation of services Disruption to the normal running of diagnostic and assessment procedures, such as endoscopy, has resulted in the potential for secondary harm to patients including delayed diagnosis and delay in treatment Difficult management decisions have been made in order to minimise COVID-19 risk for this patient group while avoiding harm Initiating and continuing immunosuppressive and biological therapies in the absence of normal surveillance and diagnostic procedures have posed many challenges Despite this, changes to working practices, including virtual clinic appointments, home faecal calprotectin testing kits and continued intensive support from clinical nurse specialists and other members of the multidisciplinary team, have resulted in patients still receiving a high standard of care, with those who require face-To-face intervention being highlighted These changes have the potential to revolutionise the way in which patients receive routine care in the future, with the inclusion of telemedicine increasingly attractive for stable patients There is also the need to use lessons learnt from this pandemic to plan for a possible second wave, or future pandemics as well as implementing some permanent changes to normal working practices In this review, we describe the diagnosis, management and direct impact of COVID-19 in paediatric patients with IBD We summarise the guidance and describe the implemented changes, evolving evidence and the implications of this virus on paediatric patients with IBD and working practices","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, assessment and management of children with inflammatory bowel disease in the UK: Implications for practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of effective therapeutics for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing global need.

Transmission rates are estimated in terms of average distances between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic time spans for which the individuals stay in each of these environments. We also introduce a collective economic resource associated with the average amount of money or income per individual to describe the socioeconomic interplay between the spreading process and the resource available to infected individuals. The epidemic-resource coupling is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate governed by the Arrhenius-like law.

Modulation of TTP expression is implicated in inflammation; however, its role in acute lung inflammation remains unknown. Accordingly, we tested the role of TTP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. LPS-challenged TTP-knockout (TTP(KO)) mice, as well as myeloid cell-specific TTP-deficient (TTP(myeKO)) mice, exhibited significant increases in lung injury, although these responses were more robust in the TTP(KO). Mice with systemic overexpression of TTP (TTP(ARE)) were protected from ALI, as indicated by significantly reduced neutrophilic infiltration, reduced levels of neutrophil chemoattractants, and histological parameters of ALI. Interestingly, while irradiated wild-type (WT) mice reconstituted with TTP(KO) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) showed exaggerated ALI, their reconstitution with the TTP(ARE) HPCs mitigated ALI. The reconstitution of irradiated TTP(ARE) mice with HPCs from either WT or TTP(ARE) donors conferred significant protection against ALI. In contrast, irradiated TTP(ARE) mice reconstituted with TTP(KO) HPCs had exaggerated ALI, but the response was milder as compared to WT recipients that received TTP(KO) HPCs. Finally, the reconstitution of irradiated TTP(KO) recipient mice with TTP(ARE) HPCs did not confer any protection to the TTP(KO) mice. These data together suggest that non-HPCs-specific overexpression of TTP within the lungs protects against ALI via downregulation of neutrophil chemoattractants and reduction in neutrophilic infiltration.","output":"Tristetraprolin Overexpression in Non-hematopoietic Cells Protects Against Acute Lung Injury in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Yemen has experienced widespread insecurity since 2014, resulting in large-scale internal displacement. In the absence of reliable vital events registration, we tried to reconstruct the evolution of Yemen's population between June 2014 and September 2021, at subdistrict (administrative level 3) resolution, while accounting for growth and internal migration. METHODS: We reconstructed subdistrict-month populations starting from June 2014 WorldPop gridded estimates, as a function of assumed birth and death rates, estimated changes in population density, net internal displacement to and from the subdistrict and assumed overlap between internal displacement and WorldPop trends. Available displacement data from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) project were subjected to extensive cleaning and imputation to resolve missingness, including through machine learning models informed by predictors such as insecurity. We also modelled the evolution of displaced groups before and after assessment points. To represent parameter uncertainty, we complemented the main analysis with sensitivity scenarios. RESULTS: We estimated that Yemen's population rose from about 26.3 M to 31.1 M during the seven-year analysis period, with considerable pattern differences at sub-national level. We found that some 10 to 14 M Yemenis may have been internally displaced during 2015C2016, about five times United Nations estimates. By contrast, we estimated that the internally displaced population had declined to 1C2 M by September 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis illustrates approaches to analysing the dynamics of displacement, and the application of different models and data streams to supplement incomplete ground observations. Our findings are subject to limitations related to data quality, model inaccuracy and omission of migration outside Yemen. We recommend adaptations to the DTM project to enable more robust estimation.","output":"Reconstructing subdistrict-level population denominators in Yemen after six years of armed conflict and forced displacement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated the prevalence and co-occurrence of addictions to tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, food/eating, the internet, texting, video games, shopping, love, sex, exercise, work, and gambling among American Indian (AI) youth in California.

Here, we further characterized the antigenic structure in the RBD by a panel of novel mAbs isolated from the mice immunized with an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. Ten of the RBD-specific mAbs were mapped to four distinct groups of conformational epitopes (designated Group A to D), and all of which had potent neutralizing activity against S protein-pseudotyped SARS viruses.

The main organ affected in this infection is the lung and the virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the target cells. In this context, a controversy raised regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) blockers, as these drugs might increase ACE2 expression in some tissues and potentially increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is specially concerning in diabetic patients as diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19. METHODS: 12-week old diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with ramipril, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Non-diabetic db/m mice were included as controls. ACE2 expression and activity were studied in lung, kidney and heart of these animals. RESULTS: Kidney ACE2 activity was increased in the db/db mice as compared to the db/m (143.2%  23% vs 100%  22.3%, p = 0.004), whereas ramipril had no significant effect. In the lung, no differences were found in ACE2 when comparing db/db mice to db/m and ramipril also had no significant effect. In the heart, diabetes decreased ACE2 activity (83%  16.8%, vs 100%  23.1% p = 0.02), and ramipril increased ACE2 significantly (83%  16.8% vs 98.2%  15%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, ramipril had no significant effect on ACE2 activity in either kidneys or in the lungs.

Understanding the molecular basis of the parasite growth and development is essential for the disease diagnosis, management and control. The tetraspanin (TSP) family of proteins are transmembrane proteins with a role in many physiological processes of eukaryotic organisms. TSPs present in the tegumental surface of platyhelminths play pivotal roles in host-parasite interaction. However, little is known about the role of TSPs in growth and development in the Platyhelminthes. To understand the role of TSP1 in the growth and development of E. granulosus we investigated the effect of EgTSP1-specific long dsRNA in different in vitro stages of the parasite. METHODS: Different stages of E. granulosus, protoscoleces and strobilated worms, were cultivated In vitro in di-phasic media. Using long dsRNA and two delivery methods, i.e. electroporation and electro-soaking, EgTSP1 silencing was performed with an EgTSP1-specific dsRNA. The TSP1 expression profile was assessed as well as the biological and ultrastructural properties of the parasites. RESULTS: After three days of dsRNA treatment, EgTSP1 expression was significantly reduced in both stages of E. granulosus as compared to irrelevant/unrelated dsRNA and untreated controls. Silencing expression of EgTSP1 in different stages of E. granulosus resulted in reduced viability and body contractions, inhibition of protoscoleces evagination and distinctive tegumental changes. Ultrastructural morphology of the strobilated worms treated with EgTSP1-specific dsRNA was indicative of the microtriches impairments and vacuolated tegument compared to the control helminths.

To evaluate visual acuity and safety of using MCTR during lens subluxation surgery in MFS patients, 66 MFS patients (110 eyes) were included in our study, with the mean duration of follow-up of 4.7 months (SD 1.76 months). The capsular bags were preserved in 101 eyes (91.81%) with MCTR implantation. There was an overall significant improvement in BCVA at 1-month follow-up which was maintained at 3 months. Multivariable linear regression revealed that older age at first visit was associated with greater postoperative BCVA at the 1-month follow-up (P = 0.007). A significant difference was found between different degrees of lens subluxation and the length of surgical time and complications. At follow-up, only two eyes (1.98%) were identified to have developed retinal detachments.

This response is reminiscent of interferon response in mammals. We are investigating putative effectors for this antiviral response. Secreted molecules have been implicated in immune responses, including interferon-related responses. We conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium from LL5 cells 24 and 48 h after dsRNA or mock treatment. We identified 304 proteins. At 24 h, 19 proteins had an abundance equal or greater than 2-fold change, while the levels of 17 proteins were reduced when compared to control cells. At the 48 h time point, these numbers were 33 and 71, respectively. The two most abundant secreted peptides at 24 h in the dsRNA-transfected group were phospholipid scramblase, an interferon-inducible protein that mediates antiviral activity, and forskolin-binding protein (FKBP), a member of the immunophilin family, which mediates the effect of immunosuppressive drugs.

Especially in the domain of healthcare, where technologies are often applied for long-term use, our experience with and relationship to such technologies become ever more relevant. Based on a 2-week interaction period with a conversational chatbot, our study (N = 58) explores the relationship between humans and technology. In particular, our study focuses on felt social connectedness of participants to the technology, possibly related characteristics of technology and users (e.g., individual tendency to anthropomorphize, individual need to belong), as well as possibly affected outcome variables (e.g., desire to socialize with other humans). The participants filled in short daily and 3 weekly questionnaires. Results showed that interaction duration and intensity positively predicted social connectedness to the chatbot. Thereby, perceiving the chatbot as anthropomorphic mediated the interrelation of interaction intensity and social connectedness to the chatbot. Also, the perceived social presence of the chatbot mediated the relationship between interaction duration as well as interaction intensity and social connectedness to the chatbot. Characteristics of the user did not affect the interrelations of chatbot interaction duration or intensity and perceived anthropomorphism or social presence. Furthermore, we did not find a negative correlation between felt social connectedness of users to the technology and their desire to socialize with other humans. In sum, our findings provide both theoretical and practical contributions. Our study suggests that regular interaction with a technology can foster feelings of social connectedness, implying transferability of dynamics known from interpersonal interaction. Moreover, social connectedness could be supported by technology design that facilitates perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence. While such means could help to establish an intense relationship between users and technology and long-term engagement, the contexts in which anthropomorphic design is, actually, the means of choice should be carefully reflected.

The community-based participatory research was adopted to collect information, document the same in daily, weekly, and monthly reports. Through a number of interactions, systematic documentation of the interventions, personal bias and social barriers were neutralized to bring a constructive and conclusive understanding. Results There are a number of sexual and reproductive health issues among the women, girls, boys and men, that often lead to multiple coercive sexual relationships and high-risk sexual behavior leading to exploitation and abuse. Sexual rights are severely compromised during emergencies and conflicts which often leads to multiple coercive sexual relationships and high-risk sexual behavior leading to exploitation and abuse. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a number of sexual difficulties and increased sexual activities over virtual platforms. Conclusion Protection of sexual rights and preventing the survivors from experiencing sexual violence are essential for their rehabilitation and recovery.

METHODS: Electronic patient records for all adult patients attending ED (n = 243,667) or acute medicine (n = 82,899) during the pandemic (2020C2021) and prior year (2019) were analysed and compared. We studied parameters including severity, primary diagnoses, co-morbidity, admission rate, length of stay, bed occupancy, and mortality, with a focus on non-COVID-19 diseases. RESULTS: During the first wave of the pandemic, daily ED attendance fell by 37%, medical admissions by 30% and medical bed occupancy by 27%, but all returned to normal within a year. ED attendances and medical admissions fell across all age ranges; the greatest reductions were seen for younger adults in ED attendances, but in older adults for medical admissions. Compared to non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions, COVID-19 admissions were enriched for minority ethnic groups, for dementia, obesity and diabetes, but had lower rates of malignancy. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions had more hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, and obesity. There were fewer low severity ED attendances during the pandemic and fewer medical admissions across all severity categories. There were fewer ED attendances with common non-respiratory illnesses including cardiac diagnoses, but no change in cardiac arrests. COVID-19 was the commonest diagnosis amongst medical admissions during the first wave and there were fewer diagnoses of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cellulitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urinary tract infection and other sepsis, but not stroke. Levels had rebounded by a year later with a trend to higher levels of stroke than before the pandemic. During the pandemic first wave, 7-day mortality was increased for ED attendances, but not for non-COVID-19 medical admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ED attendances in the first wave of the pandemic suggest opportunities for reducing low severity presentations to ED in the future, but also raise the possibility of harm from delayed or missed care. Reassuringly, recent rises in attendance and admissions indicate that any deterrent effect of the pandemic on attendance is diminishing.

Rotavirus appears to cause 30%C40% of diarrhea in toddlers. Diarrhea frequently accompanies parasitic infestation and infections in other parts of the body. Several methods, including improvement of water supplies and sanitation and administration of vaccines and antibiotics, may be useful in preventing mortality and morbidity due to diarrhea. Oral rehydration to replace fluids and electrolytes, accompanied by attention to early feeding and encouragement of breast feeding, is the most effective and economical intervention currently available.","output":"Selective Primary Health Care: Strategies for Control of Disease in the Developing World.

A large number of works on multiplicative degree based indices has been developed. However, no attention is paid in investigating their chemical significance. Investigation of the chemical importance of such indices is needed. The computation of topological indices for different chemical structures and networks is a current topic of interest in mathematical chemistry. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present work is to examine the usefulness of the multiplicative degree based indices in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling. In addition, we intend to compute the indices for some antiCOVID-19 chemicals. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The regression analysis for octane data set is performed using MATLAB and Excel to check the predictability of the indices. The sensitivity test is conducted to examine the isomer discrimination ability. To study the indices for chemical structures preventing COVID-19, different combinatorial computation methods are utilized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The regression models governing the structural dependence of different properties and activities are derived. The supremacy of the indices as useful molecular descriptors compared to some well-known and most used descriptors is established. Explicit expressions of the indices for hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir (GS-5734) and theaflavin are obtained. CONCLUSION: As the indices are shown to have remarkable efficiency in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling and isomer discrimination, the outcomes can predict different properties and activities of the chemicals under consideration.","output":"Molecular descriptors of some chemicals that prevent COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Converged security risk management is an approach that addresses interdependencies between security-related business functions that have traditionally been managed by separate departments within organizations. It is a more effective means of addressing organizational security risks and threats than tackling physical and information security challenges separately, given that the boundaries between the two are frequently blurred. However, fully converged security remains the exception rather than the rule, leaving organizations increasingly vulnerable as their adoption and reliance on digital technologies accelerates. Through interviews with eight senior security professionals, this research identified key factors critical to effective converged security risk management, expressed as drivers, barriers, and facilitators. The practitioners accounts illuminated how the modern threat landscape continues to drive further the need for such an approach, while the traditional separation of corporate security departments from the information security function in organizations remains a barrier. A greater focus on training and education, as well as soft skills, were identified as key priorities in the drive for an effective converged approach.","output":"Implementing Converged Security Risk Management: Drivers, Barriers, and Facilitators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic may not only increase mortality due to the virus but also due to the indirect effects.

MethodsIn this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CYP aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2, and described the illness profile of CYP with post-vaccination SARS- CoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CYP, and post-vaccination side-effects. FindingsBetween August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CYP aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccination reduced (proxy-reported) infection risk (-80{middle dot}4% and -53{middle dot}7% at 14-30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61{middle dot}5% and -63{middle dot}7% after 61-90 days). The probability of remaining infection-free diverged soon after vaccination, and was greater in CYP with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated CYP who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CYP; during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years. Overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CYP. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved quickly. InterpretationOne dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CYP aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection varied for SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination was generally milder, although unvaccinated CYP also had generally mild disease. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.

Research in context Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles and medRxiv for preprint papers, published between January 1, 2021 and February 15, 2022 using keywords (\\"SARS-CoV-2\\" OR \\"COVID-19\\") AND (child* OR p?ediatric* OR teenager*) AND (\\"vaccin*\\" OR \\"immunization campaign\\") AND (\\"efficacy\\" OR \\"effectiveness\\" OR \\"symptoms\\") AND (\\"delta\\" or \\"omicron\\" OR \\"B.1.617.2\\" OR \\"B.1.1.529\\"). The PubMed search retrieved 36 studies, of which fewer than 30% specifically investigated individuals <18 years. Eleven studies explored SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission: seroprevalence in children (n=4), including age-dependency of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=1), SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools (n=5), and the effect of school closure on viral transmission (n=1). Eighteen documents reported clinical aspects, including manifestation of infection (n=13), symptomatology, disease duration, and severity in children. Other studies estimated emergency department visits, hospitalization, need for intensive care, and/or deaths in children (n=4), and explored prognostic factors (n=1). Thirteen studies explored vaccination-related aspects, including vaccination of children within specific paediatric co-morbidity groups (e.g., children with Down syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer survivors, n=4), mRNA vaccine efficacy in children and adolescents from the general population (n=7), and the relation between vaccination and severity of disease and hospitalization cases (n=2). Four clinical trials were conducted using mRNA vaccines in minors, also exploring side effects. Sixty percent of children were found to have side effects after BNT162b2 vaccination, and especially after the second dose; however, most symptoms were mild and transient apart from rare uncomplicated skin ulcers. Two studies focused on severe adverse effects and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in children, reporting on myocarditis episodes and two cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome. All other studies were beyond the scope of our research. Added value of this studyWe assessed multiple components of the UK vaccination campaign in a cohort of children and young people (CYP) aged 12-17 years drawn from a large UK community-based citizen-science study, who received a first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. We describe a variant-dependent protective effect of the first dose against both Delta and Omicron, with additional protective effect of pre-vaccination SARS- CoV-2 infection on post-vaccination re-infection. We compare the illness profile in CYP infected post-vaccination with that of unvaccinated CYP, demonstrating overall milder disease with fewer symptoms for vaccinated CYP. We describe local and systemic side-effects during the first week following first-dose vaccination, confirming that local symptoms are common, systemic symptoms uncommon, and both usually transient. Implications of all the available evidenceOur data confirm that first dose BNT162b2 vaccination in CYP reduces risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 variants, with generally local and brief side-effects. If infected after vaccination, COVID-19 is milder, if manifest at all. The study aims to contribute quantitative evidence to the risk-benefit evaluation of vaccination in CYP to inform discussion regarding rationale for their vaccination and the designing of national immunisation campaigns for this age group; and applies citizen-science approaches in the conduct of epidemiological surveillance and data collection in the UK community. Importantly, this study was conducted during Delta and Omicron predominance in UK; specificity of vaccine efficacy to variants is also illustrated; and results may not be generalizable to future SARS-CoV-2 strains.","output":"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in UK school-aged children and young people decreases infection rates and reduces COVID-19 symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of lockdown measures highlights changes in terms of sounds and noises present in the everyday life The present paper deals with this peculiar and unexpected scenario as studied by means of an online survey consisting of 18 questions and distributed to residents in the Italian territory For studying the unprecedented effect of the pandemic, participants were asked to fill the questionnaire, providing personal data, describing context and characteristics of the house in which they live and making a comparison of the lockdown soundscape with the pre-lockdown one About four hundred questionnaires have been collected and analysed in order to define correlations between personal and perception variables Using logistic regression models, changes have been studied during the two above-mentioned periods It has been observed that the perception of traffic noise has increased for people over 35 years old and the noise produced by the neighbourhood has been more statistically significant for employed respondents Future outlook might provide the spread of the questionnaire in other countries for a global evaluation of the data, to be also acquired with reference to the after-lockdown period","output":"A survey on the soundscape perception before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To prevent the viral transmission from higher infected to lower infected area, controlling the vehicular traffic, consequently public movement on roads is crucial. Containment strategies and local cognition regarding pandemic might be helpful to control vehicular movement.

METHOD: Six containment strategies were considered to explore their influence on traffic condition, including declaration of general holiday, closure of educational institution, deployment of force, restriction on religious gathering, closure of commercial activities, and closure of garments factories. Newspaper coverage and public concern about COVID-19 were considered as local cognition in this research. The month of Ramadan as a potential event was also taken into account considering it might have an impact on the overall situation. Average daily journey speed (ADJS) was calculated from real-time traffic data of Google Map to understand the vehicular traffic scenario of Dhaka. A multiple linear regression method was developed to comprehend the findings. RESULTS: The results showed that among the containment strategies, declaration of general holiday and closure of educational institutions could increase the ADJS significantly, thereby referring to less traffic movement. Besides, local cognition could not significantly affect the traffic condition, although the month of Ramadan could increase the ADJS significantly.

Training needs to incorporate recent advances in digital peer support and the increase of peer support work roles internationally. There is a lack of evidence on training topics that are important for initial peer support work training and on which training topics can be provided on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to establish consensus levels about the content of initial training for mental health PSWs and the extent to which each identified topic can be delivered over the internet. METHODS: A systematized review was conducted to identify a preliminary list of training topics from existing training manuals. Three rounds of Delphi consultation were then conducted to establish the importance and web-based deliverability of each topic. In round 1, participants were asked to rate the training topics for importance, and the topic list was refined. In rounds 2 and 3, participants were asked to rate each topic for importance and the extent to which they could be delivered over the internet. RESULTS: The systematized review identified 32 training manuals from 14 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were synthesized to develop a preliminary list of 18 topics. The Delphi consultation involved 110 participants (49 PSWs, 36 managers, and 25 researchers) from 21 countries (14 high-income, 5 middle-income, and 2 low-income countries). After the Delphi consultation (round 1: n=110; round 2: n=89; and round 3: n=82), 20 training topics (18 universal and 2 context-specific) were identified. There was a strong consensus about the importance of five topics: lived experience as an asset, ethics, PSW well-being, and PSW role focus on recovery and communication, with a moderate consensus for all other topics apart from the knowledge of mental health. There was no clear pattern of differences among PSW, manager, and researcher ratings of importance or between responses from participants in countries with different resource levels. All training topics were identified with a strong consensus as being deliverable through blended web-based and face-to-face training (rating 1) or fully deliverable on the internet with moderation (rating 2), with none identified as only deliverable through face-to-face teaching (rating 0) or deliverable fully on the web as a stand-alone course without moderation (rating 3). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 training topics identified can be recommended for inclusion in the curriculum of initial training programs for PSWs. Further research on web-based delivery of initial training is needed to understand the role of web-based moderation and whether web-based training better prepares recipients to deliver web-based peer support.","output":"Initial Training for Mental Health Peer Support Workers: Systematized Review and International Delphi Consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An individual's experience of COPD is determined by many factors in addition to the pathological features of chronic bronchitis and emphysema and the symptoms that derive directly from them. Multimorbidity is the norm rather than the exception, so most people with COPD are living with a range of other medical problems which can decrease overall quality of life. COPD is caused by the inhalation of noxious particles or gases, in particular tobacco smoke, but also by early life disadvantage impairing lung development and by occupations where inhaled exposures are common (e.g. industrial, farming and cleaning work). Wealthy people are therefore relatively protected from developing COPD and people who do develop the condition may have reduced resources to cope. COPD is also no longer a condition that predominantly affects men. The prevalence of COPD among women has equalled that of men since 2008 in many high-income countries, due to increased exposure to tobacco, and in low-income countries due to biomass fuels. COPD is one of the leading causes of death in women in the USA, and death rates attributed to COPD in women in some countries are predicted to overtake those of men in the next decade. Many factors contribute to this phenomenon, but in addition to socioeconomic and occupational factors, there is increasing evidence of a higher susceptibility of females to smoking and pollutants. Quality of life is also more significantly impaired in women. Although most medications (bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) used to treat COPD demonstrate similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women, this is an understudied area and clinical trials frequently have a preponderance of males. A better understanding of gender-based predictors of efficacy of all therapeutic interventions is crucial for comprehensive patient care. There is an urgent need to recognize the increasing burden of COPD in women and to facilitate global improvements in disease prevention and management in this specific population. Many individuals with COPD follow a trajectory of both lung function decline and also multimorbidity. Unfavourable lung function trajectories throughout life have implications for later development of other chronic diseases. An enhanced understanding of the temporal associations underlying the development of coexisting diseases is a crucial first step in unravelling potential common disease pathways. Lessons can be learned from exploring disease trajectories of other NCD as well as multimorbidity development. Further research will be essential to explain how early life risk factors commonly influence trajectories of COPD and other diseases, how different diseases develop in relation to each other in a temporal way and how this ultimately leads to different multimorbidity patterns in COPD. This review integrates new knowledge and ideas pertaining to three broad themes (i) the overall burden of disease in COPD, (ii) an unappreciated high burden in women and (iii) the contrast of COPD trajectories and different multimorbidity patterns with trajectories of other NCD. The underlying pathology of COPD is largely irreversible, but many factors noted in the review are potentially amenable to intervention. Health and social care systems need to ensure that effective treatment is accessible to all people with the condition. Preventive strategies and treatments that alter the course of disease are crucial, particularly for patients with COPD as one of many problems.","output":"Contemporary perspectives in COPD: Patient burden, the role of gender and trajectories of multimorbidity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many pharmaceutical companies have recently elected to stop maintaining good laboratory practices (GLP) status of their R&D sites. Similar discussions have also been engaged in the (agro)chemical industry.

The toxicologic pathologist provides gross and histomorphologic evaluation and interpretation of nonclinical exploratory and regulatory studies during drug and (agro)chemical development. This assessment significantly contributes to human risk assessment by characterizing the toxicological profile and discussing the human relevance of the findings. The toxicologic pathologist is a key contributor to compound development decisions (advancement or termination) and in the development of de-risking strategies for backup compounds, thus playing a critical role in helping to reduce the late attrition of drugs and chemicals. Maintaining GLP compliance is often perceived as a costly and cumbersome process; a common and short-term strategy to reduce the costs is to outsource regulatory toxicity studies. However, there are significant advantages in maintaining the GLP status for toxicologic pathology activities in-house including the sustainable retention of internal pathology expertise that has maintained the necessary training needed to manage GLP studies.

Our objective was to develop a prediction model that identifies COVID-19 patients at risk for return and hospital admission within 30 days of ED discharge. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We performed a retrospective cohort study of discharged adult ED patients (n = 7,529) with SARS-CoV-2 infection from 116 unique hospitals contributing to the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER). The primary outcome was return hospital admission within 30 days.

RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among COVID-19 patients discharged from the ED on their index encounter, 571 (7.6%) returned for hospital admission within 30 days. The machine learning (ML) models (GBM, RF,: and LASSO) performed similarly.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study using data of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 collected from 34 centers in Turkey. Demographic characteristics, clinical findings, laboratory parameters (hemogram, CRP, AST, ALT, LDH, and ferritin) at admission and follow-up, and treatment strategies were reviewed. Predictors of poor clinical outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and the need for ICU admission. The secondary outcome was composite in-hospital mortality and/or ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients (male/female: 63/46, mean age: 48.4  12.4 years) were included in the study. Acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 46 (42.2%) patients, and 4 (3.7%) of the patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). A total of 22 (20.2%) patients were admitted in the ICU, and 19 (17.4%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. 14 (12.8%) of the patients died. Patients who were admitted in the ICU were significantly older (age over 60 years) (38.1% vs 14.9%, p = 0.016). 23 (21.1%) patients reached to composite outcome and these patients were significantly older (age over 60 years) (39.1% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.004), and had lower serum albumin (3.4 g/dl [2.9C3.8] vs. 3.8 g/dl [3.5C4.1], p = 0.002), higher serum ferritin (679 g/L [184C2260] vs. 331 g/L [128C839], p = 0.048), and lower lymphocyte counts (700/l [460C950] vs. 860 /l [545C1385], p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis identified presence of ischemic heart disease and initial serum creatinine levels as independent risk factors for mortality, whereas age over 60 years and initial serum creatinine levels were independently associated with ICU admission. On analysis for predicting secondary outcome, age above 60 and initial lymphocyte count were found to be independent variables in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Over the age of 60, ischemic heart disease, lymphopenia, poor graft function were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 in this patient group. Whereas presence of ischemic heart disease and poor graft function were independently associated with mortality.","output":"Predicting the outcome of COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hypercoagulable state observed in COVID-19 could be responsible for morbidity and mortality.

However, during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonal influenza virus circulation was unprecedentedly low with very few reported infections. The lack of immune stimulation to influenza viruses during this time, combined with waning antibody titres to previous influenza virus infections, could lead to increased susceptibility to influenza in the coming seasons and to larger and more severe epidemics when infection prevention measures against COVID-19 are relaxed. Here, based on serum samples from 165 adults collected longitudinally before and during the pandemic, we show that the waning of antibody titres against seasonal influenza viruses during the first two years of the pandemic is likely to be negligible. Using historical influenza virus epidemiological data from 2003-2019, we also show that low country-level prevalence of each influenza subtype over one or more years has only small impacts on subsequent epidemic size. These results suggest that the risks posed by seasonal influenza viruses remained largely unchanged during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the sizes of future seasonal influenza virus epidemics will likely be similar to those observed before the pandemic.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on future seasonal influenza epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This communication article addresses currently available rapid non-invasive methods to screen and detect periodontitis and dental peri-implantitis.

Objective: How did this composite alternative ICU workforce experience supervision, interprofessional collaboration, and quality and safety of care under the unprecedented clinical circumstances at the height of the first pandemic wave as lived experiences uniquely captured during the first peak of the pandemic? Methods: An international, cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians, nurses, and allied personnel deployed or redeployed to ICUs in Utrecht, New York, and Dublin from April to May of 2020. Data were analyzed separately for the three sites. Quantitative data were treated for descriptive statistics; qualitative data were analyzed thematically and combined for general interpretations. Results: On the basis of 234, 83, and 34 responses (response rates of 68%, 48%, and 41% in Utrecht, New York, and Dublin, respectively), we found that the amount of supervision and the quality and safety of care were perceived as being lower than usual but still acceptable. The working atmosphere was overwhelmingly felt to be collaborative and supportive. Where IC-certified nurseCtoCpatient ratios had decreased most (Utrecht), nurses voiced criticism about supervision and quality of care. Continuity within the work environment, team composition, and informal (curbside) consultations were critical mediators of success. Conclusion: In the exceptional circumstances encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic, many ICUs were managed by a composite workforce of IC-certified and redeployed personnel. Although supervision is critical for safe care, supervisory roles were not clearly related to the amount of prior ICU experience. Vital for satisfaction with the quality of care was the span of control for those who assumed supervisory roles (i.e., the ratio of certified to noncertified personnel). Stable teams that matched less experienced personnel with more experienced personnel; a strong, interprofessional, collaborative atmosphere; a robust culture of informal consultation; and judicious, more flexible use of rules and regulations proved to be essential.","output":"Supervision, Interprofessional Collaboration, and Patient Safety in Intensive Care Units during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a recently developed technology to assess antibody reactivity, quantifying antibody binding towards hundreds of thousands of candidate epitopes.

The findings show that women academics remained overwhelmed by the workload, lacked support, and endured a tiring struggle to manage their official duties and familial responsibilities. Remote teaching had been a difficult experience for them as they struggled to adapt to online learning and worked to meet the demands of students and the university. They were stressed and stuck in their children and family care and online teaching and had hardly any time for academic writing.

All horses presented with acute\\\\onset severe hindlimb lameness, in combination with swelling and pain of the dorsal tarsus. In all cases, tarsal ultrasound demonstrated diffuse thickening of subcutaneous tissues and increased hypoechoic fluid volume in the LoDETS. Sampling and analysis of the LoDETS fluid demonstrated increased nucleated cell count, neutrophil percentage or total protein, consistent with sepsis in 6/7 cases. No bacterial organisms were identified on cytology or culture. Treatment consisted of systemic and local antimicrobial therapies, nonsteroidal anti\\\\inflammatory drugs and hand walking. Treatment duration ranged from 15 to 33 days. Lameness resolved in five cases;the remaining two cases were euthanised due to complicating factors prior to resolution of lameness.

Despite the general acknowledgement of supportive supervision as a managerial mechanism for quality improvement at the district and lower-level health facilities, there is no clear policy guiding it. Second, limitations in measurement of progress in quality improvement; although supportive supervision is routinely conducted to improve maternal and newborn outcomes, efforts to measure progress are limited due to shortfalls in the setting of goals and targets, as well as gaps in M&E. Third, resource constraints and low motivation; that is, the shortage of resources C CHMT supervisors, health staff and funds C results in irregular supervision and low motivation.

However, the complex biosynthetic maturation requirements of these glycoproteins typically necessitate their production in mammalian cells to support their folding and post-translational modification. Despite these clear advantages, the incumbent costs and infrastructure requirements with this approach can be prohibitive in developing countries, and the production scales and timelines may prove limiting when applying these production systems to the control of pandemic viral outbreaks. Plant molecular farming of viral glycoproteins has been suggested as a cheap and rapidly scalable alternative production system, with the potential to perform post-translational modifications that are comparable to mammalian cells. Consequently, plant-produced glycoprotein vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza have shown promise in clinical trials, and vaccine candidates against the newly emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have entered into late stage preclinical and clinical testing. However, many other viral glycoproteins accumulate poorly in plants, and are not appropriately processed along the secretory pathway due to differences in the host cellular machinery. Furthermore, plant-derived glycoproteins often contain glycoforms that are antigenically distinct from those present on the native virus, and may also be under-glycosylated in some instances. Recent advances in the field have increased the complexity and yields of biologics that can be produced in plants, and have now enabled the expression of many viral glycoproteins which could not previously be produced in plant systems. In contrast to the empirical optimization that predominated during the early years of molecular farming, the next generation of plant-made products are being produced by developing rational, tailor-made approaches to support their production. This has involved the elimination of plant-specific glycoforms and the introduction into plants of elements of the biosynthetic machinery from different expression hosts. These approaches have resulted in the production of mammalian N-linked glycans and the formation of O-glycan moieties in planta. More recently, plant molecular engineering approaches have also been applied to improve the glycan occupancy of proteins which are not appropriately glycosylated, and to support the folding and processing of viral glycoproteins where the cellular machinery differs from the usual expression host of the protein. Here we highlight recent achievements and remaining challenges in glycoengineering and the engineering of glycosylation-directed folding pathways in plants, and discuss how these can be applied to produce recombinant viral glycoproteins vaccines.","output":"A Roadmap for the Molecular Farming of Viral Glycoprotein Vaccines: Engineering Glycosylation and Glycosylation-Directed Folding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: The mechanisms underlying impaired sleep quality in insomnia are not fully known, but an important role for sleep fragmentation has been proposed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality. METHODS: We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors. RESULTS: In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p < 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p < 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p < 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.","output":"Assessing sleep-wake survival dynamics in relation to sleep quality in a placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention study with people with insomnia and healthy controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic global shut down on physical education providers and youth sport coaches may be particularly severe due to substantial cutbacks on many of their normal activities.

This study seeks to evaluate whether spironolactone is clinically effective and cost-effective in treating acne in women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Women (18 years) with persistent facial acne requiring systemic therapy are randomised to receive one tablet per day of 50 mg spironolactone or a matched placebo until week 6, increasing to up to two tablets per day (total of 100 mg spironolactone or matched placebo) until week 24, along with usual topical therapy if desired. Study treatment stops at week 24; participants are informed of their treatment allocation and enter an unblinded observational follow-up period for up to 6 months (up to week 52 after baseline).

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving adult surgical patients treated at a large public tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Surgical activity, surgical outcomes and patient demographics were compared across two time periods, including the 'first wave' (February-May 2020 vs. February-May 2019) and the 'perseverance phase' (June-September 2020 vs. June-September 2019). Variables across both groups were compared using an independent t test or chi-squared test. RESULTS: A -32% reduction in surgical separations was observed in the 'first wave', including -20% emergency and -37% elective. In the 'perseverance phase', there was a -19% reduction in surgical activity, including 0% emergency and -27% elective. The average length of stay, intensive care admissions, postoperative complications and in-hospital costs significantly increased in the 'first wave'.

Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of results, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device.

We model the global pattern of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. METHODS: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. RESULTS: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of multiple waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential flare-ups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.

Interestingly, the correlation between the serum levels of IL-6 and the plasma aldosterone has already been demonstrated in patients affected by primary aldosteronism (PA). Thus, we suppose that hyperaldosteronism may increase IL-6 levels in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a case of 47-year-old female Covid-19 patient who had developed severe pneumonia complicated by GuillainCBarre syndrome (GBS). Blood test revealed high levels of IL-6 (serum IL-6: 402 pg/ml) and of its soluble receptor (soluble IL-6 receptor >1900 pg/ml) and she required mechanical ventilation for severe hypoxaemia. Furthermore, the evidence of right adrenal adenoma, resistant hypertension, severe hypokalaemia, and high serum levels of aldosterone with high aldosterone/renin ratio were also consistent with diagnosis of PA. Thus, Spironolactone was administered with rapid improvements in clinical condition. Finally, she was diagnosed with acute motor sensitive neuropathy and started the rehabilitation phase. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated aldosterone levels in PA may stimulate IL-6 production, inducing more severe forms of COVID-19 with the development of serious complications such as GBS. Hyperaldosteronism may also contribute to the poorest prognosis of patients with secondary aldosteronism such as heart failure and COVID-19, in which elevated IL-6 levels could exert its detrimental effects, mostly on the progression of ventricular dysfunction.

However, probe-based multiplexing requires multiple fluorescent channels, while intercalating dye-based multiplexing needs primers to be designed for amplicons having different melting temperatures. Here, we report a single fluorescent channel-based qPCR duplexing method on a model containing the sequence of chromosomes 21 (Chr21) and 18 (Chr18). We combined nonspecific intercalating dye EvaGreen with a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) probe specific to either Chr21 or Chr18. The copy number (cn) of the target linked to the FAM probe could be determined in the entire tested range from the denaturation curve, while the cn of the other one was determined from the difference between the denaturation and elongation curves. We recorded the amplitude of fluorescence at the end of denaturation and elongation steps, thus getting statistical data set to determine the limit of the proposed method in detail in terms of detectable concentration ratios of both targets. The proposed method eliminated the fluorescence overspilling that happened in probe-based qPCR multiplexing and determined the specificity of the PCR product via melting curve analysis. Additionally, we performed and verified our method using a commercial thermal cycler instead of a self-developed system, making it more generally applicable for researchers.

DNA vaccines are an attractive approach for SARS vaccine development, as they offer many advantages over conventional vaccines, including stability, simplicity, and safety. Our investigators have previously shown that DNA vaccination with antigen linked to calreticulin (CRT) dramatically enhances major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of linked antigen to CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we have employed this CRT-based enhancement strategy to create effective DNA vaccines using SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein as a target antigen. Vaccination with naked CRT/N DNA generated the most potent N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice among all of the DNA constructs tested. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with CRT/N DNA were capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of the SARS virus.

We recently demonstrated that each AR gene establishes a distinct threshold of transgene expression below which no cell can survive, with BleoR selecting for the highest level of transgene expression, nearly 10-fold higher than in cells selected using the NeoR or BsdR markers. Here, we tested the hypothesis that there may be an inverse proportionality between AR protein function and the expression of linked, transgene-encoded, recombinant proteins. Specifically, we fused each AR protein to proteasome-targeting degron tags, used these to select for antibiotic-resistant cell lines, and then measured the expression of the linked, recombinant protein, mCherry, as a proxy marker of transgene expression. In each case, degron-tagged AR proteins selected for higher mCherry expression than their cognate WT AR proteins. ER50BleoR selected for the highest level of mCherry expression, greater than twofold higher than BleoR or any other AR gene.

However, these representations do not allow quick identifications of significant changes in the outbreak; a key information for estimating the needs for hospital and ICU beds, for decision-making, and resource allocation. Moreover, an epidemic is characterised by a heterogeneous evolution that depends on many unpredictable factors, coming from the virus itself or from its ecosystem. Simulations are very complex and based on hypotheses that are impossible to certify a priori, since each outbreak is different and has specific characteristics. A validation phase is necessary that may delay the usefulness of these tools. We tested a simpler method for monitoring the epidemic and rapidly predicting the peak. RESULTS: We present here a simple and easy-to-draw figure by plotting the daily rate of change in the number of patients as a function of time. This allows: (1) to rapidly identify the changes in the infection growth, (2) to extrapolate the regression lines for predicting the peaks, and (3) to use simple statistical models for identifying the significant inflexions and deriving the uncertainties.

CONCLUSION: Plotting the daily rate of change in the number of patients as a function of time is a simple tool for monitoring an epidemic growth, allowing to quickly identify significant changes and to help in predicting the peak of the infection, with its confidence interval.","output":"The Ockhams razor for estimating the needs of ICU beds during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In Pakistan, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in February of 2020, cases peaked in June, and by January 2021, approximately 500,000 confirmed cases and over 10,000 deaths have been reported There is a lack of data in Pakistan of the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly those with severe illness, which we aim to assess Methods: This is a single-centered, observational study conducted at the COVID unit of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma in Karachi, Pakistan A manual medical record review of patients admitted from April 24, 2020 to August 24, 2020 was conducted, and all patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 pneumonia were included Results: Of 299 patients, the median age was 60 years (50-65) Males accounted for 221 (73 9%) Most common symptoms were shortness of breath seen in 270 (90 3%) and fever in 225 (75 3%) patients Diabetes mellitus (51 2%) and hypertension (50 3%) were the predominant co-morbidities COVID disease was categorized on admission as moderate in 68 (22 7%), severe in 151 (50 5%), and critical in 80 (26 8%) patients All patients received steroids, while tocilizumab was administered to 111 (44%) patients Hundred (39 7%) patients received non-invasive ventilation (NIV), while 57 (22 6%) were placed on mechanical ventilation Overall, 95 (37 7%) patients died Factors associated with mortality included older age with those above 60 years more likely to die (odds ratio [OR]: 1 925;95% CI: 1 148-3 228;p value: 0 009), presence of co-morbidities (OR 1 843;95% CI: 0 983-3 456;p value: 0 070), development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (73156 2%1 vs 57 [43 8%], p value: &lt;0 001), acute kidney injury (31 [81 6%] vs 7[118 496], p value: &lt;0 001), cardiac complications (12 [75%] vs 4 [25%], p value: 0 002), and sepsis (29 [87 9%] vs 4 [12 1%], p value: &lt;0 001) Non-survivors were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), having been placed on NIV and mechanical ventilation Laboratory parameters at final outcome found that in non-survivors, median total leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), neulrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher, while absolute lymphocyte count and platelet counts were lower which were found to be statistically significant compared to survivors Conclusion: In this study of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia at a public sector hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, most were males, and the average age was 60 years Mortality was high, and associated factors included older age, presence of comorbid conditions, and the development of ARDS, CRS, and sepsis","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia at a Public Sector Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A giant retinal tear (GRT) is a full-thickness neurosensory retinal break extending for 90 or more in the presence of a posterior vitreous detachment. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for eyes with giant retinal tear. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 8), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in our electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 August 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for giant retinal tear regardless of age, gender, lens status (e.g. phakic or pseudophakic eyes) of the affected eye(s), or etiology of GRT among participants enrolled in these trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-text articles, using Covidence. Any differences in classification between the two review authors were resolved through discussion. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials. MAIN RESULTS We found two RCTs in abstract format (105 participants randomized). Neither RCT was published in full. Based on the data presented in the abstracts, scleral buckling might be beneficial (relative risk of re-attachement ranged from 3.0 to 4.4), but the findings are inconclusive due to a lack of peer reviewed publication and insufficient information for assessing risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no conclusive evidence from RCTs on which to base clinical recommendations for scleral buckle combined with pars plana vitrectomy for giant retinal tear. RCTs are clearly needed to address this evidence gap. Such trials should be randomized, and patients should be classified by giant retinal tear characteristics (extension (90o, 90o to 180o, > 180o), location (oral, anterior, posterior to equator)), proliferative vitreoretinopathy stage, and endotamponade. Analysis should include both short-term (three months and six months) and long-term (one year to two years) outcomes for primary retinal reattachment, mean change in best corrected visual acuity, study eyes that required second surgery for retinal reattachment, and adverse events such as elevation of intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg, choroidal detachment, cystoid macular edema, macular pucker, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and progression of cataract in initially phakic eyes.","output":"Pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy for giant retinal tear."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of high concentrations of air pollution on COVID-19 has been a major air quality and life safety issue in recent studies. This study aimed to assess the contribution of different air pollution indicators in different spaces on the newly confirmed cases of coronavirus. According to causality's results between air pollution (AP) and COVID-19 infection in 9 countries, first, we examined the non-linear relationship from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5 as the rating variable (the cut point is 35 g/m3) at the national level. It is concluded that the effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on COVID-19 are more sensitive in Russia, England, Germany, and France, while O3 and PM2.5 are more sensitive in America and Canada from 21 Jan to 20 May. Second, we examined the threshold effects from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 as the threshold variables, respectively, at the municipal level in China during the period 28 Jan to 31 May. It is concluded that except CO, the remaining 5 indicators are very sensitive to the increase of newly confirmed cases, and the spread of COVID-19 can be prevented and controlled by the determination of thresholds. In addition, the 9 countries and 27 provinces show that PM2.5 in high concentrations is the more sensitive pollutant on the spread of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Association between air pollution and COVID-19 infection: evidence from data at national and municipal levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to assess the quality of life and body image of men with difficulty urinating and indwelling urinary catheter users, integrating the socio-demographic, economic and morbidity variables.

We report here the epidemiological variables associated with the high prevalence of T. evansi infection in cattle in the plain agro-climatic zone of Chhattisgarh state, India. A total of 920 blood and sera samples were tested by a combination of parasitological, molecular and serodiagnostic tests. An overall prevalence of T. evansi was recorded as 4.57% (95% CI: 3.22-5.92%), 6.09% (95% CI: 4.54-7.63%), 63.91% (95% CI: 60.81-67.01%) and 55.33% (95% CI: 52.12-58.54%) by direct microscopy, PCR, ELISA and IFAT, respectively. The Chi-Square test established a significant correlation between the prevalence of T. evansi and the season, breed and place of the study, while the association with the gender and age of the animals was insignificant. The analysis of the prevalence ratio revealed a significant association of the breed, season and place of study with the prevalence of T. evansi. As per PR observed, the prevalence was 1.63 times higher in summer and 1.68 times higher in the rainy season than in the winter (reference season). The prevalence was higher in all the districts as compared to Rajnandgaon (reference district). The prevalence ratio in Sahiwal and HF cross-breed cattle was significantly higher than the Gir breed of cattle (reference). Durg district recorded the highest prevalence of surra, and the difference was significant. The medium IFAT titre, determined in a large number of sera collected from Durg, predicted a higher incidence of trypanosomosis in that district. Since T. evansi has a broad host range, the study predicted that a large population of livestock in Chhattisgarh state were at high risk of T. evansi infection.

There is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against RSV that would induce immunological memory without causing immunopathology following natural RSV infection. We have previously generated two recombinant live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) viruses that encode immunodominant T-cell epitopes of RSV M2 protein in the neuraminidase or NS1 genes. These chimeric vaccines afforded protection against influenza and RSV infection in mice, without causing pulmonary eosinophilia or inflammatory RSV disease. The current study assessed the formation of influenza-specific and RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in the lungs of mice, with special attention to the lung tissue-resident memory T cell subsets (T(RM)). The RSV epitopes did not affect influenza-specific CD4 effector memory T cell (Tem) levels in the lungs. The majority of these cells formed by LAIV or LAIV-RSV viruses had CD69(+)CD103(-) phenotype. Both LAIV+NA/RSV and LAIV+NS/RSV recombinant viruses induced significant levels of RSV M2(82) epitope-specific lung-localized CD8 Tem cells expressing both CD69 and CD103 T(RM) markers. Surprisingly, the CD69(+)CD103(+) influenza-specific CD8 Tem responses were augmented by the addition of RSV epitopes, possibly as a result of the local microenvironment formed by the RSV-specific memory T cells differentiating to T(RM) in the lungs of mice immunized with LAIV-RSV chimeric viruses. This study provides evidence that LAIV vector-based vaccination can induce robust lung-localized T-cell immunity to the inserted T-cell epitope of a foreign pathogen, without altering the immunogenicity of the viral vector itself.","output":"Conserved T-cell epitopes of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) delivered by recombinant live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses efficiently induce RSV-specific lung-localized memory T cells and augment influenza-specific resident memory T-cell responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spread of a novel coronavirus infection in 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a real threat to public health all around the world.

Cytokine storm has a complex and not fully understood mechanism, and it can result in the multiple organ failure syndrome, associated with high mortality.

How SARS-CoV-2 is able to achieve high titer in the absence of symptoms remains unclear. Here, we examine the upper airway host transcriptional response in patients with COVID-19 (n = 93), other viral (n = 41) or non-viral (n = 100) acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Compared with other viral ARIs, COVID-19 is characterized by a pronounced interferon response but attenuated activation of other innate immune pathways, including toll-like receptor, interleukin and chemokine signaling. The IL-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are markedly less responsive to SARS-CoV-2, commensurate with a signature of diminished neutrophil and macrophage recruitment. This pattern resembles previously described distinctions between symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infections and may partly explain the propensity for pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19. We further use machine learning to build 27-, 10- and 3-gene classifiers that differentiate COVID-19 from other ARIs with AUROCs of 0.981, 0.954 and 0.885, respectively.

A total of 480 breathing sounds (240 shallow and 240 deep) were obtained from a publicly available database named Coswara. These sounds were recorded by 120 COVID-19 and 120 healthy subjects via a smartphone microphone through a website application. A deep learning framework was proposed herein that relies on hand-crafted features extracted from the original recordings and from the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as well as deep-activated features learned by a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory units (CNN-BiLSTM). The statistical analysis of patient profiles has shown a significant difference (p-value: 0.041) for ischemic heart disease between COVID-19 and healthy subjects. The Analysis of the normal distribution of the combined MFCC values showed that COVID-19 subjects tended to have a distribution that is skewed more towards the right side of the zero mean (shallow: 0.591.74, deep: 0.654.35, p-value: <0.001). In addition, the proposed deep learning approach had an overall discrimination accuracy of 94.58% and 92.08% using shallow and deep recordings, respectively. Furthermore, it detected COVID-19 subjects successfully with a maximum sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 94.96%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.90.

There were nine articles on human surveillance, two on patient and contact management, two on community restrictions, and one article discussing the combination of NPIs (quarantine, closure of facilities, and transit site surveillance). With the use of NPIs, there was a significant reduction of infection episodes among the target population. There has been an increasing demand for scientific evidence on NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and present policy recommendations rely heavily on expert judgement.

We studied students' levels of loneliness, life and academic satisfaction, acculturative stress, academic adjustment, performance, loyalty, and perceptions of the online learning experience. Results: The country-of-residence variable had no statistically significant effects on most psychological and academic variables. Significant effects were observed only for two academic variables. Specifically, students who returned to the home country found online communication with other students more contributing to their online learning experience and exhibited higher academic adjustment than students who remained in the host country. This suggests the positive influence of (peer and familial) support on online learning experience from the home country. Furthermore, a significant difference in experiencing acculturative stress occurred for students in quarantine/self-isolation in the host country, which expands prior literature on the disruptive effects of social distancing on students' mental health. Finally, this study confirmed the expected increased levels of loneliness among self-isolating students in both countries, hence extending prior results to the home- and host-country contexts.

Subjective measures were Goal Attainment Scale, Karnofsky Score, FACT-BMT, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Index. Linear mixed-effects model was used for outcome comparisons. This maximum likelihood approach utilizes all acquired data points and manages missing data points by missing at random (MAR) assumption. P values were adjusted using Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons. Results: Twenty-four eligible patients responded to the invitation and completed the program (54% male, median age 53 years (33 - 73), median time post-HCT of 37 months (13 - 68), 38% rural/remote). Based on participant feedback surveys at 6 months, this combined modality telehealth program was found to be well-accepted and safe. The 6-MWT scores were significantly higher at 3 and 12 months (M=646.5m, SD=53.34 and M=615.33m, SD= 94.95, respectively; both p < 0.01) compared to baseline (M=566.94, SD=145.22). The MBT, the only test that required participants to attend the clinic was ceased after 3 months as changes in 6-MWT paralleled changes in MBT. STS Test was significantly higher at 3 and 12 months (M=19.53, SD=6.93, p<0.01 and M=19.07 SD= 8.0; both p < 0.05) compared to baseline (M=15.14, SD=6.44). For the upper limb assessment, dominant hand grip was significantly stronger at 3, and 12 months (M=35.09, SD=9.83; p< 0.01) compared to baseline (M=29.07, SD=9.79). A significantly higher FACT-BMT total and FACT-G scores were found at 3 months (M=123.37, SD=15.12 and M=91.23, SD=11.76; p< 0.01) compared to baseline (M=116.44, SD=14.16 and M=88.25, SD=12.52 respectively), and a trend non-significant at 12 months. Conclusion: A 6-week internet and home-based exercise and MBSM programme was an acceptable, safe, and potentially effective intervention for sustained improvement of some QOL outcomes in HCT survivors.

Methods: : 73 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from three institutions in China. Radiographic features, CT score were analyzed and compared between non-emergency group (mild- and common-type) and emergency group (severe- and fatal-type). Results: : In non-emergency group, the disease slowly aggravated within the first two weeks, peaked during the 2nd week (median superimposed involvement CT score: 9.5), while in emergency group, the disease peaked in the 2nd week rapidly, and the superimposed involvement CT score(median: 20) was higher than that in non-emergency group. Both two groups began to decline in the 4th week, and persistence of high levels. In emergency group, the residual lung lesions were mostly reticular (median single reticular CT score: 10) and consolidation (median single consolidation CT score:7). By contrast, most residual lung lesions in non-emergency group were GGO (median single GGO CT score: 7) and reticular (median single reticular CT score: 4). In both non-emergency and emergency groups, GGO pattern was dominant in the first week, and the proportion in emergency group was higher [20 (65%) and (18 (72%), respectively], the consolidation pattern peaked in the second week, which were 9 (32%) and 19 (73%), respectively, reticular pattern became dominant in and after 4 weeks (both over 40%).

We draw on theories of workplace learning and social exchange to investigate the unique influence of formal training, informal learning, and organizational support for training on the turnover intentions of frontline workers battling COVID-19. Survey data were gathered from a sample of Direct Support Professionals (N = 481) in New York state who continued their work supporting individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities during the global coronavirus pandemic. The results support our predictions that employee engagement in formal training and, to a lesser extent, informal learning, as well as individuals' perceptions of organizational support for training, explain unique variance in turnover intentions. Alternative predictors. including tenure and region, explained some unique variance in turnover intentions, but neither age nor learning goal orientation demonstrated meaningful effects. Relative weights analysis revealed that the strongest negative predictors of to mover intentions were organizational support for training and engagement in formal training. Altogether these findings identify possible methods of deterring turnover intentions, by highlighting the key role that organizations play in supporting continuous learning amongst their employees, even in times of crisis.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of long-term air pollution exposure on depression risk prospectively in China. METHODS: The present study used data from Yinzhou Cohort on adults without depression at baseline, and followed up until April 2020. Two-year moving average concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter  2.5 m (PM2.5), 10 m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured using land-use regression (LUR) models for each participant. Depression cases were ascertained using the Health Information System (HIS) of the local health administration by linking the unique identifiers. We conducted Cox regression models with time-varying exposures to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of depression with each pollutant, after adjusting for a sequence of individual covariates as demographic characteristics, lifestyles, and comorbidity. Besides, physical activity, baseline potential depressive symptoms, cancer status, COVID-19 pandemic, different outcome definitions and air pollution exposure windows were considered in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Among the 30,712 adults with a mean age of 62.22  11.25, 1024 incident depression cases were identified over totaling 98,619 person-years of observation. Interquartile range increments of the air pollutants were associated with increased risks of depression, and the corresponding HRs were 1.59 (95%CI: 1.46, 1.72) for PM2.5, 1.49 (95%CI: 1.35, 1.64) for PM10 and 1.58 (95%CI: 1.42, 1.77) for NO2. Subgroup analyses suggested that participants without taking any protective measures towards air pollution were more susceptible. The results remained robust in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was identified as a risk factor for depression onset.

Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, that performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and over thirty other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool, and the GRADE approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported. (Registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks. Decontamination and reuse appear feasible to overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. These effects are applicable to emergency trauma care and should inform future recommendations.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS PROMPT-SCI (protocol for rapid onset of mobilisation in patients with traumatic SCI) is a single-site single-arm proof-of-concept trial. Forty-five patients aged 18 years or older with a severe traumatic SCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A, B or C) from C0 to L2 undergoing spinal surgery within 48 hours of the injury will be included. Participants will receive daily 30 min continuous sessions of in-bed leg cycling for 14 consecutive days, initiated within 48 hours of the end of spinal surgery. The feasibility outcomes are: (1) absence of serious adverse events associated with cycling, (2) completion of 1 full session within 48 hours of spinal surgery for 90% of participants and (3) completion of 11 sessions for 80% of participants. Patient outcomes 6 weeks and 6 months after the injury will be measured using neurofunctional assessments, quality of life questionnaires and inpatient length of stay. Feasibility and patient outcomes will be analysed with descriptive statistics. Patient outcomes will also be compared with a matched historical cohort that has not undergone in-bed cycling using McNemar and Student's t-tests for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively.

Our prior work has revealed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction by IFN- represents a key pathway to microvascular leak and terminal shock in AVHF. Here we hypothesized that Ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved JAK inhibitor known to prevent IFN- signaling, could be repurposed for host-directed therapy in AVHF. We tested the efficacy of Ruxolitinib in MHC-humanized (HHD) mice, which develop Lassa fever-like disease upon infection with the monkey-pathogenic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain WE. Anti-TNF antibody therapy was tested as an alternative strategy owing to its expected effect on macrophage activation. Ruxolitinib but not anti-TNF antibody prevented hypothermia and terminal disease as well as pleural effusions and skin edema, which served as readouts of microvascular leak. As expected, neither treatment influenced viral loads. Intriguingly, however, and despite its potent disease-modifying activity, Ruxolitinib did not measurably interfere with iNOS expression or systemic NO metabolite levels. These findings suggest that the FDA-approved JAK-inhibitor Ruxolitinib has potential in the treatment of AVHF. Moreover, our observations indicate that besides IFN--induced iNOS additional druggable pathways contribute essentially to AVHF and are amenable to host-directed therapy.","output":"The Janus Kinase Inhibitor Ruxolitinib Prevents Terminal Shock in a Mouse Model of Arenavirus Hemorrhagic Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of a previously healthy 47-year-old female with syncope due to multiple episodes of nodal dysfunction and asystole.

However, there is a scarcity of work on medical tourism promotional discourse from the textual function perspective despite the considerable number of studies in other types of discourse. This study, therefore, aims to examine and compare the promotional discourse message strategies in Malaysia and Thailand's private hospital websites. The analysis was based on Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) perspective, using Halliday & Matthiessen's model of textual analysis (2004) and Danes' classification of thematic patterns (1974). A total of six webpages with three webpages of one Malaysian website and one Thai website were analysed in relation to theme type and thematic progression. The findings show that texts derived from the hospital websites in Malaysia and Thailand display similarities and differences pertaining to how the texts are organised in relation to their theme types and thematic patterns. Both websites from Malaysia and Thailand combined objectivity with subjectivity in choosing their themes and thematic progression since they have a preference for unmarked themes in combination with marked theme to inform and persuade readers. However, the Prince Court Medical Centre (PCMC, Malaysia) website was direct and cohesive with its short texts and use of textual themes, while the message in Samitivej Hospital (SH, Thailand) website was more indirect, less compact, and less cohesive as the texts were rather lengthy and interspersed with interpersonal themes. The findings can be a guide for copywriters, website designers or medical tourism stakeholders to be aware of meaning-making strategies in promoting medical websites for medical tourism purpose.","output":"A Functional Analysis of Theme and Thematic Progression of Private Hospital Websites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Dual Enkephalinase Inhibitors (DENKIs) are involved in the regulation of nociception via opioid receptors. The novel compound STR-324 belongs to the DENKI pharmacological class. This first-in-human study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STR-324 in healthy male participants. METHODS This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending dosing study including two parts: in part 1, 30 participants received 0.004-11.475mg h-1 of STR-324 or placebo (ratio 4:1) by 4h intravenous infusion in a two-group, partial cross-over design with four treatment periods separated by one month wash-out, and in part 2, 48 participants divided into three groups received either the active drug (1.25-11.25mg h-1) or placebo (ratio 3:1) by 48h intravenous infusion. Safety and tolerability parameters, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects on neurocognitive and neurophysiological tasks and on a nociceptive test battery were evaluated. RESULTS No clinically relevant changes in safety parameters were observed. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and transient. Pharmacokinetics of STR-324 could not be determined due to most concentrations being below quantifiable limits. STR-324 metabolite concentrations were measurable, showing dose proportionality of Cmax and AUCinf with an estimated T1/2 of 0.2-0.5h. Significant changes on pharmacodynamic parameters were observed, however these were not consistent or dose-dependent. CONCLUSION STR-324 displayed favourable safety and tolerability profiles at all doses up to 11.475mg h-1. Although pharmacokinetic characterisation of STR-324 was limited, dose proportionality could be assumed based on major metabolite data assayed as proxy. No clear effects on nociceptive thresholds or other pharmacodynamic measures were observed.","output":"First-in-human trial to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STR-324, a dual enkephalinase inhibitor for pain management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the developing spinal cord, progenitor cells sequentially give rise to motor neurons and precursors of one of the major glial cell types: oligodendrocytes.

There is still insufficient understanding of how it occurs and whether it is due to the sphincter length, relaxation, or pressure differences. Aim This study evaluates the effect on the lower esophageal sphincter of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) technique applied in surgery in cases of morbid obesity using ambulatory 24-h pH monitoring (APM) and esophageal manometry (EM). Material and methods A retrospective examination was carried out on the APM and EM tests performed preoperatively and postoperatively in cases of LSG. The parameters examined were the body mass index (BMI), amplitude pressure of the esophagus (AP), total length of the lower esophageal segment (LESL), resting pressure of the LES (LESP), residual pressure of the LES (LESR), relaxation time of the LES, intragastric pressure, and the DeMeester score. Results A total of 62 cases with available data were evaluated. A statistically significant difference was determined between the preoperative values and the 3-month postoperative values of BMI, LESP, and relaxation time of the LES. A statistically significant increase was determined in the DeMeester score, and the increase in the total number of reflux episodes longer than 5 min was found to be the most responsible for this increase. No significant difference was determined in the other parameters. Conclusions The LSG was found to cause a reduction in LESP, and an increase in acid reflux causing an extended relaxation time of the LES.

This study aimed to demonstrate how employment rates as one of the main socioeconomic factors affect vaccine coverage in 50 states of the United States. Methods: This study has obtained vaccine data for the 50 states in the United States, available in the electronic online database ourworldindata.org. In addition to employment rates, other socioeconomic determinants including poverty level, uninsured rates, population density, homeownership, educational level, the percentage of the elderly population, and educational level were obtained from ourworldindata.org data platform. Data from these 50 states were used for regression analyses to examine the relationship between socioeconomic and vaccination rates. Results: Our study revealed a positive linear association between unemployment and vaccine rates, and states with higher unemployment rates were more likely to have higher vaccination rates. However, other socioeconomic measures do not significantly associate with vaccine coverage. Conclusion: Despite other studies showing that vulnerable populations had lower vaccine rates, this study shows that states with higher unemployment rates are more likely to be vaccinated. However, the finding suggests a need for more research for the states with higher than 5% unemployment rates, as they had a lower vaccine coverage than states with a range of 4% to 5% unemployment rates.","output":"Higher COVID-19 Vaccination Rates among Unemployed in the United States: State Level Study in the First 100 days of Vaccine Initiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 vaccination programme is under way. Anecdotal evidence is increasing that some people with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) experience temporary instability of blood glucose (BG) levels post-vaccination which normally settles within 2-3 days. We report an analysis of BG profiles of 20 individuals before and after vaccination. Methods We examined the BG profile of 20 consecutive adults (18 years of age or more) with T1DM using the FreeStyle? Libre flash glucose monitor in the period immediately before and after COVID-19 vaccination. The primary outcome measure was percentage(%) BG readings in the designated target range 3.9-10mmmol/L as reported on the LibreView portal for 7 days prior to the vaccination (week -1) and the 7 days after the vaccination (week +1). Results There was a significant decrease in the %BG on target following the COVID-vaccination for the 7 days following vaccination (mean 45.2% se 4.2%) vs pre-COVID-19 vaccination (mean 52.6% se 4.5%). This was mirrored by an increase in the proportion of readings in other BG categories 10.1-13.9%/ 14%. There was no significant change in BG variability in the 7days post COVID-19 vaccination. This change in BG proportion on target in the week following vaccination was most pronounced for people taking Metformin/Dapagliflozin+basal bolus insulin (-23%) vs no oral hypoglycaemic agents (-4%), and median age <53 vs 53 years (greater reduction in %BG in target for older individuals (-18% vs -9%)). Conclusion In T1DM, we have shown that COVID-19 vaccination can cause temporary perturbation of BG, with this effect more pronounced in patients talking oral hypoglycaemic medication plus insulin, and in older individuals. This may have consequences for patients with T2DM who are currently not supported by flash glucose monitoring.","output":"Analysis of continuous glucose tracking data in people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) after Covid-19 Vaccination reveals unexpected link between immune and metabolic response, augmented by adjunctive oral medication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The awareness of the occurrence of a new disease involves much uncertainty and the search for answers and also appropriate questions.

Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most promising drug candidates. The potential molecular mechanisms of the active ingredients in the six TCM recipes that target ACE2, 3CLpro and IL-6, revealed by molecular biological studies and/or network pharmacology prediction/molecular docking analysis/visualization analysis, are fully discussed.

More and more patients are searching for information on genitourinary cancers via TikTok. We aim to evaluate the functional quality and reliability of genitourinary cancer-related videos on it and share our thoughts based on the results for better public health promotion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved 167 videos on bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer from TikTok. Only 61 videos (36.53%) met the inclusion criteria and were eventually regarded as sample videos. Each videos length and descriptions, hashtags, number of views/likes/comments, forms of expression, and the uploaders profile were included. Three validated assessment instruments: the Hexagonal Radar Schema, the Health on the Net Code scale, and the DISCERN instrument, were used for evaluating the quality and reliability of the information. All misinformation was counted and categorized. Univariate analysis of variance was performed for analyzing the results. The Post-Hoc least significant difference test was conducted to explore further explanation. RESULTS: Amongst 61 sample videos, healthcare practitioners contributed the most content (n = 29, 47.54%). However, 22 posts (36.07%) were misinformative, and the most common type was using outdated data. More than half of the videos could provide good (> 1 point) content on the diseases symptoms and examinations. However, the definition and outcomes were less addressed (tied at 21%). The HONcode scale and the DISCERN instrument revealed a consistent conclusion that most videos (n = 59, 96.72%) on TikTok were of poor to mediocre quality. Videos published by media agencies were statistically better in terms of reliability and overall score (P = 0.003 and 0.008, respectively). Fifty-three videos (86.89%) had at least two unexplained medical terms. Healthcare professionals tend to use professional terms most (mean = 5.28 words). CONCLUSIONS: Most videos on genitourinary cancers on TikTok are of poor to medium quality and reliability. However, videos posted by media agencies enjoyed great public attention and interaction.

RECENT FINDINGS: Few studies have estimated the effects of climate and air pollution on health in North Africa. Most of the studies highlighted the evidence of the link between climate and air pollution as driving factors and increased mortality and morbidity as health outcomes. Each North African country prioritized research on a specific health factor. It was observed that the health outcome from each driving factor depends on the studied area and data availability. The latter is a major challenge in the region. As such, more studies should be led in the future to cover more areas in North Africa and when more data are available. Data availability will help to explore the applicability of different tools and techniques new to the region. SUMMARY: This review explores studies related to climate and air pollution, and their possible impacts on health in North Africa. On one hand, air quality studies have focused mainly on particulate matter exceedance levels and their long-term exposure impacts, namely, morbidity and mortality. The observed differences between the various studies are mainly due to the used exposureCresponse function, the studied population, background emissions, and natural emission from the Sahara Desert that characterize the region. On the other hand, climate studies have focused primarily on the impact of heat waves, vector-borne disease, and mental disorders. More than half of these studies have been on leishmaniasis disease.

Compared to three broadly used commercial in vitro diagnostic tests, our MultiCoV-Ab achieves a higher sensitivity and specificity when analyzing a well-characterized sample set of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We find a high response against endemic coronaviruses in our sample set, but no consistent cross-reactive IgG response patterns against SARS-CoV-2.

This article explores the potential value of using triage tests before reference tests when the capacity of the reference test is constrained. METHODS: We developed a simple model with inputs: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and reference test capacity. We included a case study of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigens used as triage tests before a reference polymerase chain reaction test. Performance data were obtained from an evaluation performed by an academic center on 425 samples from testing centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. RESULTS: When reference test capacity is constrained, the use of a triage test leads to a relative expansion of the population tested and cases identified; both are higher with a high-specificity triage test. When reference test capacity is not constrained, the potential advantages of introducing a triage test can be assessed using a standard cost-utility framework, balancing the utility of the reduction in the number of reference tests required against the disutility of missed cases associated with the use of a lower-sensitivity triage test. In the constrained case, the advantage of a triage testing strategy in terms of population covered and cases identified is reduced as the prevalence increases. In the unconstrained case, the reduction in reference tests required is reduced and the number of cases missed increase as the prevalence rises. CONCLUSION: When the availability of the reference test is constrained, tests added in a triage position do not need high levels of accuracy to increase the number of cases diagnosed.

This evolution results in the emergence of novel variants with different characteristics than their ancestral strain. Several recent reports have described a series of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Some of these have been identified as variants of concern (VOCs), including alpha (B.1.1.7, Clade GRY), beta (B.1.351, Clade GH), gamma (P.1, Clade GR), and delta (B.1.617.2, Clade G). VOCs are likely to have some effect on transmissibility, antibody evasion, and changes in therapeutic or vaccine effectiveness. However, the physiological and virological understanding of these variants remains poor. We demonstrated that these four VOCs exhibited differences in plaque size, thermal stability at physiological temperature, and replication rates. The mean plaque size of beta was the largest, followed by those of gamma, delta, and alpha. Thermal stability, evaluated by measuring infectivity and half-life after prolonged incubation at physiological temperature, was correlated with plaque size in all variants except alpha. However, despite its relatively high thermal stability, alphas small plaque size resulted in lower replication rates and fewer progeny viruses. Our findings may inform further virological studies of SARS-CoV-2 variant characteristics, VOCs, and variants of interest. These studies are important for the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPORTANCE The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to persist, due in part to mutations that have resulted in the emergence of different variants. Many of these variants have become more virulent and infectious than their ancestral strain, resulting in an ever-increasing spread. However, our virological understanding of these variants remains poor. Here, we directly compared the plaque size, stability, and replication kinetics of four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern following prolonged incubation at physiological temperatures. Our observations may help to characterize each variant in terms of their interactions with host factors and responses to environmental conditions. We also believe that our evaluations will improve understanding of the emergence of new variants and contribute to controlling their spread.","output":"Comparison of Plaque Size, Thermal Stability, and Replication Rate among SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apart from sporadic exported cases, the occurrence of Ebola, Marburg and Lassa virus diseases is limited to the African continent.

This issue has been recently exemplified by the large numbers of infection rates and deaths caused by covid-19 in BAME populations. Future research has the potential to improve health outcomes for these groups. High quality research priority setting is crucial to effectively consider the needs of the most vulnerable groups of the population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to identify existing research priority studies conducted for BAME health and to determine the extent to which they followed good practice principles for research priority setting. METHOD: Included studies were identified by searching Medline, Cinnahl, PsychINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, as well as searches in grey literature. Search terms included \\"research priority setting\\", \\"research prioritisation\\", \\"research agenda\\", \\"Black and minority ethnic\\", \\"ethnic group\\". Studies were included if they identified or elicited research priorities for BAME health and if they outlined a process of conducting a research prioritisation exercise. A checklist of Nine Common Themes of Good Practice in research priority setting was used as a methodological framework to evaluate the research priority processes of each study. RESULTS: Out of 1514 citations initially obtained, 17 studies were included in the final synthesis. Topic areas for their research prioritisation exercise included suicide prevention, knee surgery, mental health, preterm birth, and child obesity. Public and patient involvement was included in eleven studies. Methods of research prioritisation included workshops, Delphi techniques, surveys, focus groups and interviews. The quality of empirical evidence was diverse. None of the exercises followed all good practice principles as outlined in the checklist. Areas that were lacking in particular were: the lack of a comprehensive approach to guide the process; limited use of criteria to guide discussion around priorities; unequal or no representation from ethnic minorities, and poor evaluation of their own processes. CONCLUSIONS: Research priority setting practices were found to mostly not follow good practice guidelines which aim to ensure rigour in priority setting activities and support the inclusion of BAME communities in establishing the research agenda. Research is unlikely to deliver useful findings that can support relevant research and positive change for BAME communities unless they fulfil areas of good practice such as inclusivity of key stakeholders' input, planning for implementation of identified priorities, criteria for deciding on priorities, and evaluation of their processes in research priority setting.","output":"A systematic review to identify research priority setting in Black and minority ethnic health and evaluate their processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Data on the optimal location of the ECG leads for the diagnosis of drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) with Torsades de Pointes (TdP) are lacking.

Corresponding chest lead morphologies were inverted (35.5%), flat (19.6%) and biphasic (15.2%) T-waves. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that QT evaluation by limb leads only underestimates the incidence of diLQTS experiencing TdP and favors the screening using both limb and chest lead ECG.

The spike protein (S1 subunit) is responsible for the molecular diversity of the virus and many sero/genotypes are described around the world. Recently a new standardized classification of the IBV molecular diversity was conducted, based on phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences sampled worldwide. Brazil is one of the biggest poultry producers in the world and the present study aimed to review the molecular diversity and reconstruct the evolutionary history of IBV in the country. All IBV S1 gene sequences, with local and year of collection information available on GenBank, were retrieved. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out based on a maximum likelihood method for the classification of genotypes occurring in Brazil, according to the new classification. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with the Brazilian clade and related international sequences to determine the evolutionary history of IBV in Brazil. A total of 143 Brazilian sequences were classified as GI-11 and 46 as GI-1 (Mass). Within the GI-11 clade, we have identified a potential recombinant strain circulating in Brazil. Phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that IBV GI-11 lineage was introduced in Brazil in the 1950s (1951, 1917C1975 95% HPD) and population dynamics was mostly constant throughout the time. Despite the national vaccination protocols, our results show the widespread dissemination and maintenance of the IBV GI-11 lineage in Brazil and highlight the importance of continuous surveillance to evaluate the impact of currently used vaccine strains on the observed viral diversity of the country.","output":"Phylodynamic analysis and molecular diversity of the avian infectious bronchitis virus of chickens in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with high-dose immunoglobulin therapy in a prospective case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) receiving rituximab with an extended dosing interval. METHODS: In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, this was an interim analysis of an ongoing prospective observational study of patients who were stable on rituximab for at least 6 months and who had a planned extended dosing interval of 24 months. Only data for patients with active RRMS before rituximab were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 177 patients receiving rituximab, 33 had RRMS and MRI activity before rituximab and at least 8 months of follow-up after the last infusion. The mean (SD) age was 40 (14) years, 25 were females, the mean disease duration was 10 (6.8) years, the mean annual relapse rate (ARR) before rituximab was 1.7 (1.3), and the median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score before rituximab was 4.5 (1-7). Before extended dosing, when rituximab was infused every 6 months, the mean (SD) ARR decreased to 0.04 (0.1) (p < 0.0001) and the EDSS score to 4 (0-7) (p = 0.04). At the time of this analysis, the median follow-up since the last infusion was 11 (8-31) months. No patient showed relapse or disability progression. In total, 30 patients had at least 1 MRI performed since the last infusion (median time between the last MRI and the last infusion 10 [8-31] months). No MRI showed activity.

However, this pandemic scenario has also facilitated the rapid implementation and monitoring of technologies in the health field. In view of the occurrence of the public emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System created a contingency plan. In this paper, we aim to report the digital health strategies applied in Brazil and the first results obtained during the fight against COVID-19. Conecte SUS, a platform created to store all the health data of an individual throughout their life, is the center point of the Brazilian digital strategy. Access to the platform can be obtained through an app by the patient and the health professionals involved in the case. Health data sharing became possible due to the creation of the National Health Data Network (Rede Nacional de Dados em Sade, RNDS). A mobile app was developed to guide citizens regarding the need to go to a health facility and to assist in disseminating official news about the virus. The mobile app can also alert the user if they have had contact with an infected person. The official numbers of cases and available hospital beds are updated and published daily on a website containing interactive graphs. These data are obtained due to creating a web-based notification system that uses the RNDS to share information about the cases. Preclinical care through telemedicine has become essential to prevent overload in health facilities. The exchange of experiences between medical teams from large centers and small hospitals was made possible using telehealth. Brazil took a giant step toward digital health adoption, creating and implementing important initiatives; however, these initiatives do not yet cover the entire health system. It is expected that the sharing of health data that are maintained and authorized by the patient will become a reality in the near future.

Our aim was to examine differences in the association between oral health status and social isolation among older people by comparing Japan and England. We used cross-sectional information obtained from adults aged 65+ in two ongoing prospective cohort studies: The Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES, N = 120,195) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA, N = 3,958). The dependent variable, social isolation score (SIS) was calculated from five factors (marital status, social support from children, social support from family, social support from friends, and social participation). The independent variables were self-reported number of remaining teeth (0, 1-9, 10-19, 20) and denture use (20 teeth, 10-19 teeth with denture, 10-19 teeth without denture, 0-9 teeth with denture, 0-9 teeth without denture), while the covariates in the model were: sex, age, educational attainment, self-rated health, number of comorbidities, household annual equivalized income, mental health status, daily living activities, and smoking status. We examined associations between oral health status and SIS by applying an ordered logit model by country. Compared to England, more Japanese participants were socially isolated (1.4% vs. 5.8%), but fewer were edentulous (13.1% vs. 7.7%). In both countries, poorer oral health further increased the odds of being socially isolated. Pooled analysis of the ordered logit model with an interaction term showed that the association of number of remaining teeth with SIS was stronger in edentulous participants and in England (odds ratio = 1.50, 95% Confidence interval:1.26-1.80).

While systemic activation of coagulation leads to a coagulopathy that follows many common activation pathways and failure of endogenous regulatory anticoagulant systems, underlying conditions may utilize distinctive pathogenetic routes and may vary in clinical manifestations of the coagulopathy. The coagulation derangement associated with hematological malignancies and the coagulopathy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clearly demonstrate such differences. Malignancies are associated with venous thromboembolism due to the biological effect of malignant cells, frequent medical interventions, or the presence of indwelling vascular catheters. The underlying pathogenesis of cancer-associated coagulopathy relies on tissue factor-mediated activation of coagulation, cytokine-controlled defective anticoagulant pathways, fibrinolytic changes, and dysfunctional endothelium. There is an additional risk caused by anti-cancer agents including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The underlying pathogenetic factor that contributes to the thrombotic risk associated with chemotherapy is endothelial cell injury (or loss of protection of endothelial integrity, for example, by vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition). In addition, individual anti-cancer agents may have specific prothrombotic effects. One of the remarkable features of severe COVID-19 infections is a coagulopathy that mimics but is not identical to the disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy and has been identified as a strong marker for an adverse outcome. Severe COVID-19 infections cause inflammation-induced changes in coagulation in combination with severe endothelial cell injury. This coagulopathy likely contributes to pulmonary microvascular thrombosis, bronchoalveolar fibrin deposition (which is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome) and venous thromboembolic complications.","output":"Pathophysiology of Coagulopathy in Hematological Malignancies and in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak spread from China all around the world, causing thousands of deaths In Italy, the hardest hit region was Lombardy, with the first reported case on 20 February 2020 San Raffaele Scientific Institute - a large tertiary hospital and research centre in Milan, Italy - was immediately involved in the management of the public health emergency Since the beginning of the outbreak, the elective surgical activity of the hospital was rapidly reduced and large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganised to admit and assist patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) In addition, the hospital became the regional referral hub for cardiovascular emergencies in order to keep ensuring a high level of health care to non-COVID-19 patients in northern Italy In a few days, a COVID-19 emergency department was created, improving the general ward capacity to a total number of 279 beds dedicated to patients with COVID-19 Moreover, the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds was increased from 28 to 72 (54 of them dedicated to patients with COVID-19, and 18 to cardiology and cardiac surgery hub emergencies), both converting pre-existing areas and creating new high technology spaces All the involved health care personnel were rapidly trained to use personal protection equipment and to manage this particular category of patients both in general wards and ICUs Furthermore, besides clinical activities, continuously important research projects were carried out in order to find new strategies and more effective therapies to better face an unprecedented health emergency in Italy","output":"Fast reshaping of intensive care unit facilities in a large metropolitan hospital in Milan, Italy: facing the COVID-19 pandemic emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) continues its rapid growth as a treatment approach for aortic stenosis, costs associated with TAVI and its burden to healthcare systems will assume greater importance. Patients undergoing TAVI between January 2012 and November 2017 in the Nationwide Readmission Database were identified. Trends in cause-specific readmissions were assessed using Poisson regression. Thirty-day TAVI cost burden (cost of index TAVI hospitalization plus total 30-day readmissions cost) was adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars and trended over year from 2012 to 2017. Overall, 47,255 TAVI were included and 30-day readmissions declined from 20% to 12% (p<0.0001). Most common causes of readmission (heart failure, infection/sepsis, gastrointestinal causes, and respiratory) declined as well, except arrhythmia/heart block which increased (1.0% to 1.4%, p<0.0001). Cost of TAVI hospitalization ($52,024 to $44,110, p<0.0001) and 30-day cost burden ($54,122 to $45,252, p<0.0001) declined. While costs of an average readmission did not change ($9,734 to $10,068, p=0.06), cost burden of readmissions (per every TAVI performed) declined ($4,061 to $1,883, p<0.0001), including reductions in each of the top 5 causes except arrhythmia/heart block ($171 to $263, p=0.04). Index TAVI hospitalizations complicated by acute kidney injury, length of stay &#8805;5 days, low hospital procedural volume, and skilled nursing facility discharge were associated with increased odds of 30-day readmissions. In conclusion, the costs of index hospitalizations and 30-day cost burden for TAVI in the U.S. significantly declined from 2012-2017. However, readmissions due to arrhythmia/heart block and their associated costs increased.

Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the involvement of digital technologies in creative industries is inevitable. The study compares the conventional working model and online working process to clarify how digital turn affects the interaction between creative clusters and the built environment in consideration of social sustainability. Firstly, this paper looks at the social interactions in creative clusters, and investigates how creative class engages with the physical environment in the office environment. It also takes a step further and focuses on how digital turn takes place in this pattern by applying a case study through online surveys in Izmir, Turkey. It contains Architecture and Interior Design firms as a significant part of creative industries located in Izmir. The online survey was applied in order to get information about the space preferences of the creative clusters, and figure out the major differences between conventional working model and online working model in terms of social sustainability. The findings of this study provide insight about impacts of digitalization on creative clusters in the urban environments. It is seen that environmental behaviors of the creative class have direct effects on the process of the local urban development. Using digital technologies for communication has eliminated the surprise factor and damaged the use of urban-buzz areas where creative class meet their social and cultural needs. This study suggests that, during this adaptation period to the changing model, precautions should be taken in the earlier stages for the city development.

Ordinal logistic regression analyses of 13,515 valid and population-weighted responses indicate a general increase in exercise frequencies, as well as in sedentary behavior. Except for people aged 55+, previously low active adults self-reported to exercise more during the lockdown. Among the people who were already high active before COVID-19, those above 55 years old, those with low education, those used to exercise with friends or in a sport club, and those who were not using online tools to exercise, self-reported to exercise less during the lockdown. Having less time, sitting more, and missing the familiar way and competitive element of exercising were the main reasons for a self-reported exercise reduction.

Thirty-two highly prevalent mutants were retrieved from the GISAID database, and their structural models were built using the SWISS-Model server. The stabilization effect for each mutation was assessed by the DUET and DeepDGG software. By applying molecular docking using both Z-Dock and Haddock software we found that multiple mutations, including A475V, V455E, V445L, and V445I, resulted in the higher binding free energy as compared to the wild type (WT) spike protein, thus had a destabilizing effect on the binding to ACE2. On the other hand, several mutants, including the most prevalent N501Y and B.1.1.7 variants, as well as the K444R, L455F, Q493R, and Y505W variants exhibited lower binding free energy as compared to the WT spike. These mutants showed an increased number of electrostatic interactions with ACE2 than the WT spike protein, and they changed the interaction pattern of the neighboring residues.

METHODS: In a territory-wide cohort of 10,445 COVID-19 patients from Hong Kong who were hospitalized between 21(st) January 2020 and 31(st) January 2021, 1544 patients had received dexamethasone during hospitalization. Exposure group consisted of patients who had initiated remdesivir prior to dexamethasone (n=93), or co-initiated the two drugs simultaneously (n=373); whereas non-exposure group included patients who were given remdesivir after dexamethasone (n=149), or those without remdesivir use (n=929). Multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting for propensity score were applied and hazard ratios (HR) of event outcomes were estimated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Time to clinical improvement (HR=1.23, 95%CI 1.02-1.49, p=0.032) and positive IgG antibody (HR=1.22, 95%CI 1.02-1.46, p=0.029) were significantly shorter in the exposure group than that of non-exposure.

Immunity and vaccination passports have been suggested to facilitate the greater movement of those with acquired immunity and who have been vaccinated. Another group of individuals who pose a low risk to others during pandemics are those with genetically mediated resistances to pathogens. In this paper, we introduce the concept of genomic passports, which so far have not been explored in the bioethics literature. Using COVID-19 as an illustrative example, we explore the ethical issues raised by genomic passports and highlight differences and similarities to immunity passports.

Mental health system infrastructure, primarily developed to support individuals through in-person care, struggled to meet rising demand for services even prior to COVID-19. With public health guidelines requiring the use of physical distancing during the pandemic, digital mental health supports may be one way to address the needs of the population. Despite this, barriers exist in promoting and supporting access to existing and emerging digital resources. Text messaging may address some of these barriers, extending the potential reach of these digital interventions across divides that may separate some vulnerable or disadvantaged groups from essential mental health supports. Building on an existing knowledge synthesis project identifying key digital resources for improved mental health, this research will establish low-tech connections to assess need and better match access to services for those who need it most. The aim of this study is to codesign a customised two-way texting service to explore need and better align access to mental health supports for Canadians located in Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be completed in Saskatchewan, Canada. For this project, the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework will be used to support three phases of a sequential mixed-method study. An advisory committee of Saskatchewan residents will guide this work with the study team. A 10-week service will be launched to connect individuals with appropriately suited digital mental health interventions through the use of text messaging. In phase 1, implementation and prototyping will be conducted with collaborative codesign for key elements related to features of an enrolment survey and initial messaging content. Phase 2 will focus on advancing the effectiveness of the service using quantitative user data. In phase 3, an embedding approach will be used to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the overall acceptability, satisfaction and perceived benefit of the text messaging service. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics will be used as analytic methods. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received approval from the Research Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan. A knowledge dissemination plan has been developed that includes traditional academic approaches such as conference presentations, and academic publications, as well as mainstream approaches such as social media, radio and dissemination through the advisory committee.","output":"Supporting population mental health and wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: protocol for a sequential mixed-method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate sleep patterns of hospital nurses using a wearable electronic device and determine the influence of rotating day and night shifts and lifestyle factors on their sleep efficiency. BACKGROUND Nurses working in shifts are vulnerable to sleep disturbances. However, little is known about the influence of rotating day and night shift schedules and healthy lifestyle on nurses' daily sleep patterns. DESIGN Descriptive correlational design. METHODS Thirty-two hospital nurses working in shifts and 32 hospital nurses not working in shifts participated in data collection. Their sleep patterns were measured for six consecutive days using Fitbit Charge 3? , and information on alcohol consumption, exercise, and eating habits were assessed using a questionnaire. Data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Scheffe's test and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guideline. RESULTS Overall, nurses working on rotating day and night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and lower sleep efficiency than those not working in shifts. In particular, nurses working for 3 or 4 consecutive night shifts had significantly shorter total sleep time, lower sleep efficiency and longer sleep onset latency than those working for 0-2 consecutive night shifts. Rotating day and night shifts and alcohol consumption significantly influenced sleep efficiency. CONCLUSIONS A work schedule of 3 consecutive night shifts and the habit of alcohol consumption before bed time influence nurses' sleep efficiency.

Possible risk factors, including gender, age, comorbidities, nursery school or kindergarten attendance, earlier diagnosis, no immunization, lower regional temperature, earlier season, and period of onset, were evaluated using binary logistic regression methods. RESULTS A total of 13,040 (type A, 8861; B, 4179) children were evaluated. Significant risk factors (p < 0.05) in multivariate analyses were young age, lower regional temperature, earlier season, respiratory illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:2.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.84-4.13), abnormal behavior and/or unusual speech (aOR:2.78, 95% CI:1.61-4.80), and seizures at onset (aOR:16.8, 95% CI:12.1-23.3) for influenza A; and young age, lower regional temperature, respiratory illness (aOR:1.99, 95% CI:1.00-3.95), history of febrile seizures (aOR:1.73, 95% CI:1.01-2.99), and seizures at onset (aOR:9.74, 95% CI:5.44-17.4) for influenza B. CONCLUSIONS In addition to previously known factors, including young age, seizures, and respiratory illness, abnormal behavior and/or unusual speech and lower regional temperature are new factors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) remains a significant public health concern after the epidemic in 2003. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralize SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV) could provide protection for exposed individuals. Methods. Transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes were immunized with the recombinant major surface (S) glycoprotein ectodomain of SARS-CoV. Epitopes of 2 neutralizing MAbs derived from these mice were mapped and evaluated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. Results. Both MAbs bound to S glycoprotein expressed on transfected cells but differed in their ability to block binding of S glycoprotein to Vero E6 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed 2 antibody-binding epitopes: one MAb (201) bound within the receptor-binding domain at aa 490C510, and the other MAb (68) bound externally to the domain at aa 130C150. Mice that received 40 mg/kg of either MAb prior to challenge with SARS-CoV were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs, and doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg offered significant protection. Conclusions. Two neutralizing epitopes were defined for MAbs to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Antibodies to both epitopes protected mice against SARS-CoV challenge.

Plain gauze wetted with normal saline is commonly used for a pin site dressing owing to the simplicity and low cost. Evidence to support adding an antimicrobial agent in the dressing material is lacking. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We compared the rate of pin tract infection using plain gauze and gauze impregnated with polyhexamethylene biguanide in patients undergoing limb lengthening procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included 38 patients (40 limbs) undergoing limb lengthening or deformity correction using an external fixator between July 2009 and June 2010. There were 23 male patients and 15 female patients, with a mean age of 26.3 years (range, 5-68 years). The patients were randomized into two groups: a polyhexamethylene biguanide group (22 limbs) and a control group (18 limbs). The metal-skin interfaces were assessed by a researcher blinded to the type of gauze at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery for the pin site infection based on a predetermined grading system. There were a total of 483 metal-skin interfaces, with 1932 total observations. Infection rates were compared using the chi square test and relative risk with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS The infection rate was lower ((2) [1, n = 1932] = 23.00) and the risk for infection was lower (relative risk, 0.228; 95% confidence interval, 0.118, 0.443) for the polyhexamethylene biguanide group (n = 1068; 1.0%) than for the control group (n = 864; 4.5%).

When conjugated OVA-sHsp was delivered intranasally to na?ve mice, the resulting immune response to OVA was accelerated and intensified, and OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent within 5 days after a single immunizing dose, illustrating its utility for vaccine development. If animals were pretreated with a disparate VLP, P22 (a non-replicative bacteriophage capsid), before OVA-sHsp conjugate immunization, OVA-specific IgG1 responses were apparent already by 4 days after a single immunizing dose of conjugate in OVA-na?ve mice. Additionally, the mice pretreated with P22 produced high titer mucosal IgA, and isotype-switched OVA-specific serum IgG. Similarly, sHsp pretreatment enhanced the accumulation of lung germinal center B cells, T follicular helper cells, and increased polymeric Ig receptor expression, priming the lungs for subsequent IgG and IgA responses to influenza virus challenge. Thus, sHsp nanoparticles elicited quick and intense antibody responses and these accelerated responses could similarly be induced to antigen chemically conjugated to the sHsp. Pretreatment of mice with P22 further accelerated the onset of the antibody response to OVA-sHsp, demonstrating the utility of conjugating antigens to VLPs for pre-, or possibly post-exposure prophylaxis of lung, all without the need for adjuvant.","output":"A virus-like particle vaccine platform elicits heightened and hastened local lung mucosal antibody production after a single dose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported by Chinese authorities at the end of 2019.

OBJECTIVES To describe the association between early markers of cardiovascular function and renal perfusion with AKI occurrence in a cohort of preterm infants < 32 weeks' gestation. METHODS 128 infants were prospectively included from birth to discharge. During the first day of life, we assessed cardiovascular function, systemic and organ blood flow by Doppler ultrasound, and monitored cerebral and renal regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). These measures were analyzed in relation to developing AKI and serum creatinine (SCr) peak from day 2 to 7 of life. RESULTS 12 of 128 infants presented with AKI (9.4%). SCr peak was 155.3  30.2 mol/L in infants with AKI versus 82.0  16.5 in non-AKI infants (p < 0.001). Among all measures of cardiovascular function and renal perfusion, low mean cerebral and renal rSO2 during the first day of life and a low resistive index at renal artery Doppler were significantly associated with developing AKI. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, low renal rSO2 on the first day of life remained associated with a high SCr peak from day 2 to 7 of life.

Dynamic testing strategies are mandatory to establish efficient mitigation strategies against the disease; to be cost effective, they should adapt to regional prevalences. Seroprevalence surveys that detect individuals who have mounted an immune response against COVID-19 will help to determine the total number of infections within a community and improve the epidemiological calculations of attack and case fatality rates of the virus. They will also inform about the percentage of a population that might be immune against re-infections. Methods: We developed a sensitive and specific cell-based assay to detect conformational SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) S1 antibodies in human serum, and have cross-evaluated this assay against two FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We performed pseudovirus neutralization assays to determine whether sera that were rated antibody-positive in our assay were able to specifically neutralize SARS-2-S. We pooled up to 24 sera and assessed the group testing performance of our cell-based assay. Group testing was further optimized by Monte Carlo like simulations and prospectively evaluated. Findings: Highly significant correlations could be established between our cell-based assay and commercial antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-2-S S1 antibody-positive sera neutralized SARS-2-S but not SARS-S, and were sensitively and specifically detected in pools of 24 samples. Monte Carlo like simulations demonstrated that a simple two-step pooling scheme with fixed pool sizes performed at least equally as well as Dorfman's optimal testing across a wide range of antibody prevalences. Interpretation: We demonstrate that a cell-based assay for SARS-2-S S1 antibodies qualifies for group testing of neutralizing anti-SARS-2-S antibodies. The assay can be combined with an easily implemented algorithm which greatly expands the screening capacity to detect anti-SARS-2-S antibodies across a wide range of antibody prevalences. It will thus improve population serological testing in many countries.","output":"24 People, one test: Boosting test efficiency using pooled serum antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of an 84-year-old female patient hospitalized for surgical treatment of a hip fracture who re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with an RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab approximately 6 months after presenting mild respiratory symptoms with confirmed COVID-19 in April 2020.

Macrophages and dendritic cells are both key sentinel cells in the host immune response and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of flavivirus infections. Recent studies showed that ZIKV could productively infect monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), but the role of macrophages in ZIKV infection remains incompletely understood. In this study, we first compared ZIKV infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and moDCs derived from the same donors. We demonstrated that while both MDMs and moDCs were susceptible to epidemic (Puerto Rico) and pre-epidemic (Uganda) strains of ZIKV, virus replication was largely restricted in MDMs but not in moDCs. ZIKV induced significant apoptosis in moDCs but not MDMs. The restricted virus replication in MDMs was not due to inefficient virus entry but was related to post-entry events in the viral replication cycle. In stark contrast with moDCs, ZIKV failed to inhibit STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in MDMs. This resulted in the lack of efficient antagonism of the host type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Importantly, depletion of STAT2 but not STAT1 in MDMs significantly rescued the replication of ZIKV and the prototype flavivirus yellow fever virus. Overall, our findings revealed a differential interplay between macrophages and dendritic cells with ZIKV.

While HCT dendrograms tend to optimize local coherent clustering patterns, SVD leading eigenvectors usually identify better global grouping and transitional structures. RESULTS: This study proposes a flipping mechanism for a conventional agglomerative HCT using a rank-two ellipse (R2E, an improved SVD algorithm for sorting purpose) seriation by Chen [3] as an external reference. While HCTs always produce permutations with good local behaviour, the rank-two ellipse seriation gives the best global grouping patterns and smooth transitional trends. The resulting algorithm automatically integrates the desirable properties of each method so that users have access to a clustering and visualization environment for gene expression profiles that preserves coherent local clusters and identifies global grouping trends. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate, through four examples, that the proposed method not only possesses better numerical and statistical properties, it also provides more meaningful biomedical insights than other sorting algorithms. We suggest that sorted proximity matrices for genes and arrays, in addition to the gene-by-array expression matrix, can greatly aid in the search for comprehensive understanding of gene expression structures.

Fencing competitions are structured as direct elimination tournaments, where randomness is explicitly present in some rules. We focused on pe, which is one of three disciplines. We collected data on international competition results and annual rankings, in the range 2008C2020, for male and female fencers under 20 years old (Junior category). Then, we built the model calibrated on our dataset and parametrized by just one free variable a, describing the importance of talentand, consequently, of chancein competitions (a = 1 indicates the ideal scenario where only talent matters, a = 0 the complete random one). Our agent-based approach can reproduce the main stylized facts observed in data, at the level of both single tournaments and the entire careers of a given community of pe fencers. We find that simulations approximate very well the data for both Junior Men and Women when talent weights slightly less than chance, i.e. when a is around 0.45. We conclude that the role of chance in fencing is unusually high and it probably represents an extreme case for individual sports.

To better understand host immune determinants of congenital infection at the maternal-fetal tissue interface, we performed a comparative analysis of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood and decidua of healthy rhesus macaque pregnancies across all trimesters of gestation and determined changes after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection.

Decidual leukocytes showed a striking enrichment of activated effector memory and tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ Tregs, CD56+ NK cells, CD14+CD16+ monocytes, CD206+ tissue-resident macrophages, and a paucity of B lymphocytes when compared to peripheral blood. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) revealed unique populations of decidual NK, T, DC and monocyte/macrophage subsets. Principal component analysis showed distinct spatial localization of decidual and circulating leukocytes contributed by NK and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and separation of decidua based on gestational age contributed by memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Decidua from 10 ZIKV-infected dams obtained 16-56 days post infection at third (n=9) or second (n=1) trimester showed a significant reduction in frequency of activated, CXCR3+, and/or Granzyme B+ memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and ?3?

Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community.

The Gharat is made from the natural resources that are easily available in the area and operates through the water force coming from glaciers, perennial streams and rivulets. Thus, it is an environment friendly source of livelihood for the Gharatis (the owner of Gharat). In the present communication, an effort was made to document the status of Gharats in the high-altitude Himalayan regions of Pangi and Tissa of district Chamba. Field surveys were conducted in a total of twenty remote villages of Pangi and Tissa regions (ten in each site). Information was collected on pre-designed semi-structured questionnaires from local people that primarily consisted of Gharatis, elderly informants and the inhabitants living in the vicinity of Gharats. All possible reasons responsible for the increase and reduction in the number of Gharats in the study areas were also documented by interviewing the informants. The study revealed that in the Pangi region number of Gharats have increased and are in good condition whereas there is a drastic decline in the number of Gharats in Tissa. The informants in Pangi gave maximum responses favouring motivational factors while in Tissa maximum responses were obtained for demotivational factors. Based on these responses, we prioritized the corrective measures for improving the efficiency of Gharats and restoration of this age-old indigenous and environment friendly technology.

Higher levels indicate more severe infection and have been used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease severity. However, the evidence for CRP as a prognostic marker is yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to examine the CRP response in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and to determine the utility of CRP on admission for predicting inpatient mortality. METHODS: Data were collected between 27 February and 10 June 2020, incorporating two cohorts: the COPE (COVID-19 in Older People) study of 1564 adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to 11 hospital sites (test cohort) and a later validation cohort of 271 patients. Admission CRP was investigated, and finite mixture models were fit to assess the likely underlying distribution. Further, different prognostic thresholds of CRP were analysed in a time-to-mortality Cox regression to determine a cut-off. Bootstrapping was used to compare model performance [Harrells C statistic and Akaike information criterion (AIC)]. RESULTS: The test and validation cohort distribution of CRP was not affected by age, and mixture models indicated a bimodal distribution. A threshold cut-off of CRP 40 mg/L performed well to predict mortality (and performed similarly to treating CRP as a linear variable). CONCLUSIONS: The distributional characteristics of CRP indicated an optimal cut-off of 40 mg/L was associated with mortality.

The development of decision support tools for real-time clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is of prime importance to assist patients triage and allocate resources for patients at risk. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 2 to June 15, 2020, clinical patterns of COVID-19 suspected patients at admission to the EDs of Lige University Hospital, consisting in the recording of eleven symptoms (i.e. dyspnoea, chest pain, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, dry cough, wet cough, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fever and anosmia) plus age and gender, were investigated during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Indeed, 573 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by qRT-PCR before mid-June 2020, and 1579 suspected cases that were subsequently determined to be qRT-PCR negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, two most relevant symptoms of COVID-19 were identified in addition of the age of the patient, i.e. fever (odds ratio [OR] = 3.66; 95% CI: 2.97C4.50), dry cough (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.39C2.12), and patients older than 56.5 y (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.67C2.58). Two additional symptoms (chest pain and sore throat) appeared significantly less associated to the confirmed COVID-19 cases with the same OR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56C0.94). An overall pondered (by OR) score (OPS) was calculated using all significant predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68C0.73) rendering the use of the OPS to discriminate COVID-19 confirmed and unconfirmed patients. The main predictors were confirmed using both sensitivity analysis and classification tree analysis. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the OPS and the cycle threshold (Ct values) of the qRT-PCR.

The aim of this review is to summarize available evidence providing an official position statement of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) METHODS: A comprehensive Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library search was performed. Due to the limited evidence and the lack of studies, it was not possible to formulate recommendations according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria. RESULTS: Several molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 can justify the presence of virus within the testis and possible alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome. Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects. CONCLUSION: Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small GTPase Nucleolar GTP-binding protein 1 (AtNOG1) plays a role in biotic stress tolerance. Here, we created transgenic rice lines constitutively overexpressing AtNOG1-1 or AtNOG1-2. We also developed rice RNA interference (RNAi) lines that show downregulation of OsNOG1. AtNOG1-1 and AtNOG1-2 overexpressors showed enhanced drought tolerance without compromising grain yield, whereas OsNOG1-RNAi was more susceptible to drought when compared to wild-type plants. Analysis of physiological parameters showed increased cell sap osmolality, relative water content, and abscisic acid (ABA) level, but decreased leaf water loss in AtNOG1-1 or AtNOG1-2 overexpressor lines compared to the control. We found upregulation of several genes involved in ABA and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, stomata regulation, osmotic potential maintenance, stress protection, and disease resistance in AtNOG1-1 and AtNOG1-2 overexpressor lines compared to the control. We elucidated the role of NOG1-2 and NOG1-1 in regulation of silica body formation around stomata to prevent transpirational water loss. These results provide an avenue to confer drought tolerance in rice.","output":"Overexpression of Arabidopsis nucleolar GTP-binding 1 (NOG1) proteins confers drought tolerance in rice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42  13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported a significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on the economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected the perceived impact on the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency in terms of psychological, social, and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population, actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis.","output":"Covid-19 Outbreak In Italy: Are We Ready for the Psychosocial and the Economic Crisis?

First of all, Chapter Two introduces the implications of the digital platform market in terms of competition policy, and the recent economic theories and global discussion trends for anti-competitive M&A which could arise from these features. Significant features of the digital platforms such as economies of scale, network effects, cost reduction in collecting, analyzing, and storing data will create pro-competitive effects of increasing consumer welfare on the demand side as well as reducing inefficiencies on the production side. However, these pro-competitive features at the same time can also lead to potential monopolization in the market, or a?tippinga? toward dominant firms, due to the significantly robust economies of scope possible in the digital platform market. In particular, even though a?killer acquisitionsa? to eliminate potential competitors in the future can cause serious anti-competitive effects in the competitive process of tech companies, many mergers and acquisitions conducted by tech giants such as GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) since 2010 have been approved by competition authorities without any conditions or screening process. This situation sparked debate on whether the previous competition law paradigm could be applied in the digital economy without any modification. In this line, some leading competition authorities worry that the current merger review policy can undermine the possible birth and development of start-ups, which could grow to be future competitors. They also address the need to introduce a new regulation paradigm. Chapter Three covers market competition in the digital economy of six ASEAN member states a Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Thailand a which have relatively sizable digital economies. This chapter explicitly addresses the issues of e-commerce, ride-hailing and online delivery, online travel booking, and over-the-top media service. In addition, we investigate global digital platform M&A cases in the region from 2015 to 2019 using the Thomson Reuters EIKON data set and identify the features of the cases by country and industry. While market competition structure and features differ from country to country, sustainable growth of the digital platform market in the region is expected considering the rapid growth rates of this regiona?s population and economy. The recent COVID-19 outbreak will accelerate the growing trend due to the subsequent increase in online activities, even though some sectors such as ride-hailing are experiencing adverse effects due to the pandemic. However, because ride-hailing companies such as Grab and Gojek are leveraging their platforms to expand their business areas into delivery and finance services, the growing effects in the market are greater than contracting ones in total. We find that the M&A activities of the digital platform companies are very active as the relevant market grows in the region. Most of all, e-commerce and ride-hailing account for the most significant portion of the market. M&A transactions in the e-commerce sector of Chinese companies occupy a large portion. Looking at major M&A cases in the e-commerce sector, we can identify the cases of Lazada and Tokopedia conducted by Alibaba in China. On the other hand, a promising local platform based on ASEAN, Grab merged with the global platform Uber. Through this market situation, we observe that fierce competition is taking place between local and global platforms. Chapter Four first addresses the introduction of competition laws in all ASEAN member states and then delves into a comparison of competition laws in four countries (Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, and the Philippines), focusing on merger review regimes. While Indonesia was the first country to introduce a competition law in ASEAN, Singapore and the Philippines operate relatively advanced competition policies vis-a-vis the United States or European Union. Viet Nam started to accept global standards since the comprehensive amendment of its competition law in 2018. In regulating anti-cartel behaviors, all four countriesa? competition authorities commonly separate a?per se illegal rulea? and a?rule of reasona? when enforcing their laws, but the range and cartel types to apply those rules differ from country to country. Three countries except for Indonesia run leniency programs which grant exemptions or reduction of penalty when cartel firms concede their illegal behaviors to competition authorities. In the regulation of abuse of dominance, all four countries assume that a firm has a dominant position if the firm's market share is above a certain threshold. The competition laws explicitly regulate the types of prohibited behaviors. The threshold is 60% in Singapore, 50% in Indonesia and the Philippines, and 30% in Viet Nam, which implies that Singapore's competition law applies the most relaxed standards and Viet Nam the most strict standards. Compared to the regulation of cartel conduct and abuse of dominance, merger review regimes show significantly heterogeneous institutional characteristics. The requirements for reporting mergers and acquisitions show a wide spectrum: Singapo e has a post-review process where competition law requires firms to report the M&As afterwards but do not have to report consolidations in advance. However, Viet Nam and the Philippines have a mandatory pre-review process where merging firms are obligated to report the M&As to the authorities and obtain approval in advance. In the middle of the two regimes, Indonesia runs voluntary pre-review and mandatory post-review regimes. These institutional differences can lead the firms to conduct cross-border M&As in the ASEAN region to deal with increasing competition law risks. Chapter Five consists of two main sections. The first section studies and compares each of the four competition authoritiesa? decisions on whether the authorities approved a representative cross-border M&A case in the region in 2018, the Grab-Uber M&A case, or not. In particular, this section investigates why each competition authority reached different conclusions on the same M&A case. The competition authorities of Singapore and the Philippines both decided that the Grab-Uber M&A was anti-competitive. They argued that the consolidated Graba?s market power after the merger would be strengthened due to the elimination of its strong competitor, Uber. The merger had the effect of easing intense competition pressure in the digital platform market. Nonetheless, due to the institutional limitations of the voluntary post-review regime in the country, the merger was approved by Singaporea?s competition authority with certain behavioral remedies, such as restrictions against raising prices. The Philippinesa? competition authority approved the case, but took a slightly different method from Singaporea?s by finalizing it by way of consent order. In Viet Nam, the Vietnam Competition and Consumer Authority (VCCA) delivered its initial opinion that the M&A should not be approved due to the potential competition restrictive effects, however the Vietnam Competition Council (VCC), as the final decision commission, chose not to accept the proposal and approved the merger without any conditions. The Indonesian competition authority did not apply the competition law, arguing that the merger did not show any changes of control rights regulated in the law and only was considered as sales of an asset. The second section empirically analyzes the economic effects of the Grab-Uber M&A case on market competition using the data set provided by Allied Market Research. The data set includes information on the features of consumers and three ride-hailing applications, Grab, Uber, and Gojek, from 2008 to 2019. Compared to other countries, the results show that the anti-competitive effects from the merger were weaker in Indonesia where the consolidated Grab still has a strong competitor, Gojek. Based on the analysis results presented in Chapters two to five, we confirmed the rapid growth of digital platforms and intensified competition in the digital platform market of the ASEAN region. Also, it is expected that the competition authorities will more actively enforce their competition laws in the digital platform market. Considering the legal and institutional gaps across countries and divide in their capacity to enforce competition laws, it is important to synchronize the ASEAN member statea?s regimes by reducing the heterogeneity in competition policy within the region. Also, capacity building programs to enhance enforcement skills should be addressed. In particular, due to the complicated nature and convergence features of the digital economy, competition authorities in ASEAN should consider a new regulation paradigm in competition policy suitable to the changing digital competition environments.","output":"Competition Policy and Law in the ASEAN Countries: Focusing on Digital Platform M&A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses arise through cross-species transmission and can cause potentially fatal diseases in humans.

In doing so, the lived experiences of remote learners who were abruptly shifted to a completely online learning space due to the pandemic COVID-19 in the Indian higher education system are documented. Online interviews were conducted with eight undergraduate and four postgraduate students of English and Cultural Studies, enrolled at a Southern Indian university, and their responses were explicated using the Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach. The interviews revealed that the phenomenon of ERL is shaped by dissonance informed by the absence of a familiar learning space. Often the patterns of this dissonance were marked by (1) the perception of learning and learning space, (2) the lack of intimacy in learning and learning space, (3) the negotiations made for learning and the space of learning in ERL, and (4) the challenges to cope with the responsibilities of the ERL scenario. Further, the script approach was applied to analyse the data and the analysis revealed an expansion of the existing internal scripts that were based on previous learning experiences of the learners. The study thus establishes the centrality of space in the process of learning and points out how the lack of a familiar learning space is linked to the absence of internal scripts that considerably impact learning. The study concludes by discussing the possibilities of application of script approach to effectively incorporate the aspect of learning space in new pedagogies and learning models as Blended Learning (BL) and Online Learning (OL) become the new normal worldwide.","output":"Why learning space matters: a script approach to the phenomena of learning in the emergency remote learning scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To battle with economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government implemented various measures to mitigate economic loss.

Our finding suggests that stimulus payment has a significant immediate effect of boosting spending, but it typically does not reverse a downward trend. State-wide reopening had a small effect on spending. Foot traffic increased gradually after stimulus check issuance, but only increased slightly after reopening, which also coincided or preceded several policy changes and confounding events (e.g., protests) in the US.

Here we describe the methodology, how vulnerability is distributed across the U.S., and assess the impact on vulnerable communities over the first year of the pandemic. Methods: The index combines 40 indicators into seven themes, drawing on both public and proprietary data. We associate timeseries of COVID-19 cases, deaths, test site access, and rental arrears with vulnerability. Results: Although overall COVID-19 vulnerability is concentrated in the South, the seven underlying themes show substantial spatial variability. As of May 13, 2021, the top-third of vulnerable counties have seen 21% more cases and 47% more deaths than the bottom-third of vulnerable counties, despite receiving 27% fewer tests (adjusted for population). Individual vulnerability themes vary over time in their relationship with mortality as the virus swept across the country. Over 20% of households in the top vulnerability tercile have fallen behind on rent. Poorer test site access for rural vulnerable populations early in the pandemic has since been alleviated.

Using NMR, we determined a high-resolution structure of the Bax core region, revealing a dimer with the nonpolar surface covering the lipid bilayer edge and the polar surface exposed to water. The dimer tilts from the bilayer normal, not only maximizing nonpolar interactions with lipid tails but also creating polar interactions between charged residues and lipid heads.

The situation is escalating in educational sectors due to a lousy working environment intertwined with extracurricular deeds. However, empirical evidence focusing on academicians in higher education society is negligible. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence and risk factors of WRUEDs among university teaching staff in Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study design from March to April 2021. A sample of 607 academicians were recruited using a stratified sampling technique, and a self-administered structured Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire was used to assess upper extremity disorders during the past 12 months. The collected data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and analyzed using STATA version 14 software. The association between dependent and independent variables was computed with a binary logistic regression. The association was ascertained using an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) at a p value of <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 607 participants correctly completed the questionnaire (response rate of 95.44%). Age ranges from 21 to 70 with a mean of 32.39 (SD  6.80)) years, and the majority (76.28%) of them were males. The prevalence of WRUED during the last 12 months was 59.14% [95% CI (55.1, 63.1)]. There is no significant difference in prevalence between males and females (45.14% versus 14%), respectively; (2) = 0.001; p=0.974. Working more than 8 hours per day [AOR: 2.37; 95% CI (1.40, 4.00)], not performing physical exercise [AOR: 2.34; 95% CI (1.6, 3.45)], and job dissatisfaction [AOR: 2.50; 95% CI (1.69, 3.68)] were factors significantly increased the risk of experiencing WRUEDs. CONCLUSION: This study divulged upper extremity disorder among university teaching staff is pervasive, with more than three-fifth of the academicians were suffering from the condition, and it also indicates that males experienced higher proportions of pain than females. The manifestation of upper extremity disorder was affected by working hours per day, physical activity, and job satisfaction. Optimizing working hours, having a group regular exercise, and proper management of workplace conditions related to job satisfaction are recommended to lessen the condition.","output":"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Work-Related Upper Extremity Disorders among University Teaching Staff in Ethiopia, 2021: An Institution-Based Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"well-being is a multi-faceted concept that should be an operational domain.

The impact of these surgical delays on survival for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 37 730 patients in the National Cancer Database with HNSCC who underwent primary surgical management from 2004 to 2016 was performed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of overall survival. Bootstrapping methods were used to identify optimal time-to-surgery (TTS) thresholds at which overall survival differences were greatest. Cox proportional hazard models with or without restricted cubic splines were used to determine the association between TTS and survival. RESULTS: The study identified TTS as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS). Bootstrapping the data to dichotomize the cohort identified the largest rise in hazard ratio (HR) at day 67, which was used as the optimal TTS cut-point in survival analysis. The patients who underwent surgical treatment longer than 67 days after diagnosis had a significantly increased risk of death (HR, 1.189; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.122-1.261; P < 0.0001). For every 30-day delay in TTS, the hazard of death increased by 4.6%. Subsite analysis showed that the oropharynx subsite was most affected by surgical delays, followed by the oral cavity.

In addition, we aimed to identify the potential differences in HAV sero-prevalence based on age, among other variables. We recruited the study participants at Jordan University Hospital in Amman, Jordan, during October 2020CJune 2021. Assessment of participants socio-demographic variables was done using a paper-based questionnaire. Testing for HAV IgG was based on a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study population comprised 360 individuals with a median age of 18 years. The overall sero-prevalence of HAV in our study sample was 38.3%. Divided by age, the sero-prevalence of HAV was 8.2%, 12.3%, and 20.8% among individuals aged 10 years or less, 15 years or less, and 30 years or less, respectively. The estimated age at mid-population immunity was between 21 and 30 years. Besides age, individuals residing outside the Central region of Jordan had a significantly higher HAV sero-prevalence. Additionally, the use of filtered municipal water was associated with a lower sero-prevalence of HAV compared with the use of unfiltered municipal water among individuals aged 15 years or less. The results of this study suggest an intermediate to low endemicity of HAV in Jordan. An epidemiologic shift of HAV sero-prevalence with a declining rate of positivity for HAV IgG was noticed in this study.

Little is known about such ancient epidemics and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the Great Plague. Host genomes, however, offer an indirect way to detect ancient epidemics beyond the current temporal and physical limits. Arms races with pathogens have shaped the genomes of the hosts by driving a large number of adaptations at many genes, and these signals can be used to detect and further characterize ancient epidemics. Here, we detect the genomic footprints left by ancient viral epidemics that took place in the past approximately 50 000 years in the 26 human populations represented in the 1000 Genomes Project. By using the enrichment in signals of adaptation at approximately 4500 host loci that interact with specific types of viruses, we provide evidence that RNA viruses have driven a particularly large number of adaptive events across diverse human populations. These results suggest that different types of viruses may have exerted different selective pressures during human evolution. Knowledge of these past selective pressures will provide a deeper evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats.

METHODS A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS The search yielded 7995 unique records; 27 studies evaluating 20 interventions were included. The majority of studies were conducted in USA, with five in Australia and one in Peru. Study designs were cross-sectional (n=13); qualitative (n=5); mixed methods (n=4); experimental (n=3); and quasi-experimental (n=2). Relevance to participating Indigenous communities was rated moderate to low. Interventions were diverse in aims, ingredients, and outcomes. Aims involved (1) supporting the healthcare journey, (2) increasing knowledge, (3) providing psychosocial support, and (4) promoting dialogue about cancer. The main ingredients of the interventions were community meetings, patient navigation, arts, and printed/online/audio materials. Participants were predominately female. Eighty-nine percent of studies showed positive influences on the outcomes evaluated. No studies addressed all four dimensions of holistic wellness (physical, mental, social, and spiritual) that are central to Indigenous health in many communities. CONCLUSION Studies we found represented a small number of Indigenous Nations and Peoples and did not meet relevance standards in their reporting of engagement with Indigenous communities. To improve the cancer survivorship journey, we need interventions that are relevant, culturally safe and effective, and honoring the diverse conceptualizations of health and wellness among Indigenous Peoples around the world.","output":"Interventions to improve cancer survivorship among Indigenous Peoples and communities: a systematic review with a narrative synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines and therapeutics using in vitro transcribed mRNA hold enormous potential for human and veterinary medicine. Transfection agents are widely considered to be necessary to protect mRNA and enhance transfection, but they add expense and raise concerns regarding quality control and safety. We found that such complex mRNA delivery systems can be avoided when transfecting epithelial cells by aerosolizing the mRNA into micron-sized droplets. In an equine in vivo model, we demonstrated that the translation of mRNA into a functional protein did not depend on the addition of a polyethylenimine (PEI)-derived transfection agent. We were able to safely and effectively transfect the bronchial epithelium of foals using naked mRNA (i.e., mRNA formulated in a sodium citrate buffer without a delivery vehicle). Endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree and histology of mucosal biopsies indicated no gross or microscopic adverse effects of the transfection. Our data suggest that mRNA administered by an atomization device eliminates the need for chemical transfection agents, which can reduce the cost and the safety risks of delivering mRNA to the respiratory tract of animals and humans.","output":"Safe and effective aerosolization of in vitro transcribed mRNA to the respiratory tract epithelium of horses without a transfection agent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In December, 2019, a type of novel coronavirus which was designated novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) by World Health Organization (WHO) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Since then, the country has been combatting countrywide community spread. This report describes how the Virology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) is supporting the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to diagnose infections with this virus in Ghana. Methods: The National Influenza Centre (NIC) in the Virology Department of the NMIMR, adopted real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020. Samples from suspected cases and contact tracing across Ghana were received and processed for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were 'pooled' to enable simultaneous batch testing of samples without reduced sensitivity. Outcomes: From February 3 to August 21, the NMIMR processed 283 946 (10%) samples. Highest number of cases were reported in June when the GHS embarked on targeted contact tracing which led to an increase in number of samples processed daily, peaking at over 7,000 samples daily. There were several issues to overcome including rapid consumption of reagents and consumables. Testing however continued successfully due to revised procedures, additional equipment and improved pipeline of laboratory supplies. Test results are now provided within 24 to 48 hours of sample submission enabling more effective response and containment. Conclusion: Following the identification of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2infection by the NMIMR, the Institute has trained other centres and supported the ramping up of molecular testing capacity in Ghana. This provides a blueprint to enable Ghana to mitigate further epidemics and pandemics. Funding: The laboratory work was supported with materials from the Ghana Health Service Ministry of Health, the US Naval Medical Research Unit #3, the World Health Organization, the Jack Ma Foundation and the University of Ghana Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. Other research projects hosted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research contributed reagents and laboratory consumables.

Current primary health care and specialist services do not have the resources to meet the complex needs of these children. METHOD/DESIGN: This stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial will allocate 18 communities to one of five 6-monthly intervention start dates. Stratification will be by region and population size. The intervention (Hearing for Learning Initiative, HfLI) consists of six 20-h weeks of training (delivered over 3 months) that includes Certificate II in Aboriginal Primary Health Care (3 modules) and competencies in ear and hearing data collection (otoscopy, tympanometry and hearScreen), plus 3 weeks of assisted integration into the health service, then part-time employment as Ear Health Facilitators to the end of the trial. Unblinding will occur 6 months prior to each allocated start date, to allow Community Reference Groups to be involved in co-design of the HfLI implementation in their community. Relevant health service data will be extracted 6-monthly from all 18 communities. The primary outcome is the difference in proportion of children (0 to 16 years of age) who have at least one ear assessment (diagnosis) documented in their medical record within each 6-month period, compared to control periods (no HfLI). Secondary outcomes include data on sustainability, adherence to evidence-based clinical guidelines for otitis media, including follow-up and specialist referrals, and school attendance. Structured interviews with staff working in health and education services, Ear Health Trainees, Ear Health Facilitators and families will assess process outcomes and the HfLI broader impact. DISCUSSION: The impact of training and employment of Ear Health Facilitators on service enhancement will inform the health, education and employment sectors about effectiveness of skills and job creation that empowers community members to contribute to addressing issues of local importance, in this instance ear and hearing health of children.

While research to deliver vaccines and antivirals are being pursued, various effective technologies to control its environmental spread are also being targeted. Ultraviolet light (UV-C) technologies are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms when used even on large surface areas. In this study, we developed a pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency based genomic model to predict the sensitivity of select enveloped and non-enveloped viruses to UV-C treatments in order to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 and human norovirus surrogates. The results revealed that this model was best fitted using linear regression with r(2) = 0.90. The predicted UV-C sensitivity (D(90) C dose for 90% inactivation) for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was found to be 21.5 and 28 J/m(2), respectively (with an estimated 18 J/m(2) obtained from published experimental data for SARS-CoV-1), suggesting that coronaviruses are highly sensitive to UV-C light compared to other ssRNA viruses used in this modeling study. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 strain with a D(90) of 21 J/m(2) close to that of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a suitable surrogate to validate SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by UV-C treatment. Furthermore, the non-enveloped human noroviruses (HuNoVs), had predicted D(90) values of 69.1, 89, and 77.6 J/m(2) for genogroups GI, GII, and GIV, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV-1) of GV with a D(90) = 100 J/m(2) was identified as a potential conservative surrogate for UV-C inactivation of these HuNoVs. This study provides useful insights for the identification of potential non-pathogenic (to humans) surrogates to understand inactivation kinetics and their use in experimental validation of UV-C disinfection systems. This approach can be used to narrow the number of surrogates used in testing UV-C inactivation of other human and animal ssRNA viral pathogens for experimental validation that can save cost, labor and time.","output":"Genomic Modeling as an Approach to Identify Surrogates for Use in Experimental Validation of SARS-CoV-2 and HuNoV Inactivation by UV-C Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth can benefit older adults during COVID-19.

Moreover, it has not been clarified whether children or teenagers could be considered a problem for SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or, on the contrary, whether parents and school workers play a greater role. The aims of this review are to discuss about childrens safety at school and the better strategies currently able to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at school. MAIN AIM: Compared to adults, very few cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in children, who generally suffered from an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease. Moreover, school closure is systematically associated with the development of problems involving students, teachers and parents, particularly among populations with poor resources. Although several researches have tried to evaluate the real efficacy of school closure for pandemic control over time, no definitive answer to this question has been given. Available findings seem to confirm that to ensure adequate learning and to avoid social and economic problems, schools must remain open, provided that the adults who follow children at home and at school absolutely comply with recommendations for prevention measures and that school facilities can be optimized in order to significantly reduce the spread of infection. In this regard, the universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safe distancing in schools, at least starting from the age of 6 years, seems extremely useful. Moreover, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak the use of telemedicine to manage suspected SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in the community has appeared to be an easy and effective measure to solve many paediatric problems and could represent a further support to schools . CONCLUSIONS: We think that schools must remain open, despite COVID-19 pandemic. However, several problems strictly related to school frequency and reduction of infectious risk must be solved before school attendance can be considered completely safe. A single more in-depth guideline agreed between countries with the same school problems could be very useful in eliminating doubts and fostering the compliance of students, teachers and non-teaching school staff reducing errors and misinterpretations.","output":"Comprehensive and safe school strategy during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Anatomic abnormalities increase the risk of deceased donor kidney discard, but their effect on transplant outcomes is understudied. We sought to determine the effect of multiple donor renal arteries on early outcomes after deceased donor kidney transplantation. Methods: For this retrospective cohort study, we identified 1443 kidneys from 832 deceased donors with 1 kidney transplanted at our center (2006-2016). We compared the odds of delayed graft function and 90-day graft failure using logistic regression. To reduce potential selection bias, we then repeated the analysis using a paired-kidney cohort, including kidney pairs from 162 donors with one single-artery kidney and one multiartery kidney. Results: Of 1443 kidneys included, 319 (22%) had multiple arteries. Multiartery kidneys experienced longer cold ischemia time, but other characteristics were similar between groups. Delayed graft function (50% multiartery versus 45% one artery, P=0.07) and 90-day graft failure (3% versus 3%, P=0.83) were similar between groups before and after adjusting for donor and recipient characteristics. In the paired kidney analysis, cold ischemia time was significantly longer for multiartery kidneys compared with single-artery kidneys from the same donor (33.5 versus 26.1 hours, P<0.001), but delayed graft function and 90-day graft failure were again similar between groups.

We aim to determine the impact of steroid use for COVID-19 pneumonia on hospital mortality. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study in a university hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March of 2020. To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids, and we adjusted with a propensity score for patients on steroid treatment. Survival times were compared using the log rank test. Different steroid regimens were compared and adjusted with a second propensity score. During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were not. Global mortality was 15.1%. The median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10 days (interquartile range [IQR], 8 to 13 days). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.96]; P = 0.044).

This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.","output":"Main Clinical Features of COVID-19 and Potential Prognostic and Therapeutic Value of the Microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are used as personalized protective equipment for health care personnel. PAPRs offer health care workers added protection when dealing with patients who have high-risk infectious disease such as COVID-19. Unfortunately, PAPRs can produce notable levels of background noise. We hypothesize that PAPR use may be associated with increased hearing thresholds and impaired word discrimination and may ultimately have a negative impact on effective communication. Herein, we (1) determined sound levels generated by PAPRs and (2) measured hearing thresholds and word discrimination with and without operational PAPRs. All participants had normal hearing. When the PAPR was operational, mean  SD thresholds increased from 4.5  3.6 to 38.6  5.6 dB HL (P < .001). Word discrimination dropped from 100% in all participants in quiet to a mean 48%  14% with operational PAPR (P < .001).

RESULTS The response rate of hospitals in 1993 was 91% (523/572), and in 2007 it was 92% (323/353). In 1993, 65% of hospitals (335/516) had a policy that all women should have initial electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and in 2007, 74% (235/319) had such a policy. In 1993, 55% of hospitals (284/516) used epidural anaesthesia as one of the methods for pain control, and in 2007, 87% of hospitals (278/318) did so.

Many individuals now regularly watch ASMR videos to relax, and alleviate symptoms of stress and insomnia, all which are indicative of elevated levels of anxiety. Emerging literature suggests that ASMR-capable individuals are characterised by high trait neuroticism, which is associated with a tendency to experience negative emotional states such as anxiety. To date however no literature has empirically linked these personality constructs and watching ASMR videos on the effect of reducing anxiety. In the current study, 36 ASMR-experiencers and 28 non-experiencers watched an ASMR video, and completed assessments of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and pre- / post-video state anxiety. MANCOVA with Group as the independent measures factor showed that ASMR-experiencers had significantly greater scores for neuroticism, trait anxiety, and video engagement than non-experiencers. Pre-video state anxiety was also significantly greater in the ASMR-experiencers and was significantly attenuated on exposure to the ASMR video, whereas non-experiencers reported no difference in state anxiety pre- and post-video. Thus, watching ASMR alleviated state anxiety but only in those who experienced ASMR. Subsequent mediation analyses identified the importance of pre-existing group differences in neuroticism, trait and (pre-video) state anxiety in accounting for the group difference in the reduction of state anxiety. The mediation analysis further lends support for watching ASMR videos as an intervention for the reduction of acute state anxiety.

Methods A prospective study was conducted in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit of the Affiliated Zhengzhou Central Hospital of Zhengzhou University from October 2017 to February 2020. The study included 65 severe pneumonia patients with ARDS, who was performed by measurement of pulse index continuous cardiac output and survived more than 3days after admission. The Extravascular Lung Water IndexEVLWI, sICAM-1, KL-6 and Oxygenation Index(OI) on 1st, 3rd and 5th day were detected.

Independent risk factors of mortality in severe pneumonia patients with ARDS were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curve was drawnand the prognostic value of each parameter was assessed finally. Results The PCT, EVLWI, sICAM-1, KL-6 and APACHE  score in the death group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (P<0.05) at RICU admission, and the length of RICU stay was significantly shorter than that in the survival group (P<0.05), while differences in other clinical characteristics between two groups were not statistically significantP>0.05. These parameters including levels of EVLWI, sICAM-1, KL-6, Procalcitonin and APACHE  score in the death group were significantly higher than those in the survival group on the 1st3rd and 5th day (P<0.05), whereas the OI was significantly lower than that of the survival group on the 3rd and 5th day (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that EVLWI, sICAM-1, KL-6 level were significantly related with the mortality of these patients. The levels of sICAM-1, kl-6 and EVLWI on 1st3rd and 5th day after RICU admission showed a significant negative correlation with OI (P<0.001). Whereas, The levels of sICAM-1, kL-6 on 1st3rd and 5th day showed a significant positive correlation with EVLWI (P<0.001).

Blended learning is a heterogeneous mode of teaching and learning that combines face-to-face (F2F) and online modes. Owing to advances in technology, and recently, the advent of pandemics, such as COVID-19, the need for multimodal teaching approaches, such as blended learning, to enhance access to education in universities has become very important. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach that used a structured questionnaire for data collection from a sample of 432 postgraduate students was used. Data validation was done using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The structural equation modelling technique was used for data analysis. Findings: Results showed that out of the seven factors of the UTAUT2, the factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation significantly and positively influenced the behavioural intentions of students in universities to accept blended learning. On the other hand, habit and price value did not significantly influence university students' behavioural intentions to accept the bended learning mode. It was further shown in the study that behavioural intentions significantly influenced the acceptance of blended learning by university students. In light of the above results, it was concluded that the UTAUT2 could be used to predict the acceptance of blended learning by university students. Research limitations/implications: The main study limitation was that it was only carried out at universities that had information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure challenges owing to the fact that the economic situation in Zimbabwe is depressed. Limited ICT infrastructure in the universities might have had some impact on the nature of behavioural intentions of students to accept blended learning as a learning mode. Further research could be carried out in countries with better economies that are able to fund ICT infrastructures of their universities and to establish whether the results of the current study could either be confirmed, disconfirmed or enriched. Practical implications: The paper suggests that universities need to increase investment in ICT infrastructure as well as in capacitating students with the necessary ICT skills for the effective use of institutional ICT when learning using the blended learning mode. Without adequate and appropriate ICT infrastructure as well as necessary ICT skills, students may develop low motivation levels and negative attitudes towards blended learning, which may eventually may affect their acceptance of the learning mode. Originality/value: There is no known study that has been conducted using the UTAUT2 to establish antecedents of behavioural intentions of students to accept blended learning in the context of Zimbabwean universities. This study therefore opens new ground on factors influencing the acceptance of blended learning in the context of Zimbabwean universities. Also, the results showed that habit and price value do not significantly contribute to the behavioural intentions of university students to accept blended learning, which is not consistent with findings of past studies. This inconsistency opens new opportunities for further studies on the conditions under which these two factors can be used to significantly contribute to the development of behavioural intentions of students to accept blended learning. ? 2022, Norman Rudhumbu.","output":"Applying the UTAUT2 to predict the acceptance of blended learning by university students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

RNA expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and protein expression by Western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. Cell migration and invasion were measured by transwell assays. Targeting relationships between genes were tested by luciferase reporter gene assays. Results Lower GABPB1-AS1 expression was found in ccRCC cells and tissues. GABPB1-AS1 expression was inversely associated with tumor size, TNM stage, and Furhman stage. High GABPB1-AS1 expression was associated with a better prognosis. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion by 786-o and caki-1 cells. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression reduced tumor weights in xenograft experiments. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-1246 overexpression significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of 786-o and caki-1 cells transfected with wild-type (WT)-GABPB1-AS1 or WT-PCK1. Knockdown of PCK1 weakened the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by GABPB1-AS1 overexpression in 786-o and caki-1 cells.

HLH has clinical manifestations related to abnormal prolonged activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with an excess of proinflammatory cytokines. The main causes of secondary HLH are malignancies and infectious diseases. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 54-year-old man, originally from Eastern Africa, who had lived in Northern Europe for 30 years. Here we describe the clinical features, laboratory parameters, diagnostic workup, management and outcome data of a previously healthy 54-year-old man diagnosed with HLH secondary to tuberculosis. The patient was initially treated for a community-acquired pneumonia. He developed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypertransaminasemia, and kidney and bone marrow dysfunction. The clinical course together with a simultaneous increase in serum ferritin raised the suspicion of HLH. The patient fulfilled seven out of eight diagnostic criteria for HLH. A thorough diagnostic workup with respect to HLH and a potential underlying disease was initiated. Cultivation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, stool and urine, and polymerase chain reaction of epithelioid cell granulomas in the bone marrow were all positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He was treated for both HLH and tuberculosis, and he survived without any sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: We present one of few published cases of a patient who survived HLH triggered by miliary tuberculosis.

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion euro. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact.

Methods PLWH hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong were included, compared with age-matched and disease severity-matched SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (ratio of 1:5) from February 1st 2020 to July 31st 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by public health laboratory and virus concentration was quantified by an in-house real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were performed. Results HIV patients had a similar respiratory shedding profile compared to controls. Duration of faecal shedding of patient A, B, C and D were at least 9, 10, 33, and 11 days respectively. HIV patients had lower plasma levels of IL-10 and NT-pro-BNP. All 4 PLWH cases showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies detected in serum collected between day 18-30 after symptom onset. Conclusions PLWH behaves similarly with HIV-negative controls in respiratory viral load, but with decrease in IL-10 and NT-proBNP.

Possible predictive biomarkers for tumor angiogenesis, such as, microvessel density (MVD), hypoxia and cell proliferation, can be determined using immunohistochemical staining. However, patients ineligible for surgical treatment need to undergo invasive diagnostic interventions in order to determine these biomarkers. CT perfusion (CTP) is an emerging functional imaging technique, which can non-invasively determine vascular properties of solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CTP with histological biomarkers in CRLM. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with CRLM underwent CTP one day before liver surgery. CTP analysis was performed on the entire volume of the largest metastases in each patient. Dual-input maximum slope analysis was used and data concerning arterial flow (AF), portal flow (PF) and perfusion index (PI) were recorded. Immunohistochemical staining with CD34, M75/CA-IX and MIB-1 was performed on the rim in the midsection of the tumor to determine respectively MVD, hypoxia and cell proliferation. RESULTS Twenty CRLM in 20 patients were studied. Mean size of the largest CRLM was 37 mm (95% CI 21-54 mm). Mean AF and PF were respectively 64 ml/min/100ml (95% CI 48-79) and 30 ml/min/100ml (95% CI 22-38). Mean PI was 68% (95% CI 62-73). No significant correlation was found between tumor growth patterns and CTP (p = 0.95). MVD did not significantly correlate to AF (r = 0.05; p = 0.84), PF (r = 0.17; p = 0.47) and PI (r = -0.12; p = 0.63). Cell proliferation also did not significantly correlate to AF (r = 0.07; p = 0.78), PF (r = -0.01; p = 0.95) and PI (r = 0.15; p = 0.52). Hypoxia did not significantly correlate to AF (r = -0.05; p = 0.83), however, significantly to PF (r = 0.51; p = 0.02) and a trend to negative correlation with PF (r = -0.43; p = 0.06). However, after controlling the false discovery rate, no significant correlation between CTP and used immunohistochemical biomarkers was found. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this feasibility study found a trend to negative correlation between PI and hypoxia, CTP might therefore possibly evaluate this prognostic marker in CRLM non-invasively.

LMICs have significant experience implementing vaccination campaigns to respond to epidemic threats but are often hindered by chronic health system challenges. We sought to identify transferable lessons for COVID-19 vaccination from the rollout of three vaccines that targeted adult groups in Africa and South America: MenAfriVac (meningitis A); 17D (yellow fever) and rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola virus disease). METHODS: We conducted a rapid literature review and 24 semi-structured interviews with technical experts who had direct implementation experience with the selected vaccines in Africa and South America. We identified barriers, enablers, and key lessons from the literature and from participants experiences. Interview data were analysed thematically according to seven implementation domains. RESULTS: Participants highlighted multiple components of vaccination campaigns that are instrumental for achieving high coverage. Community engagement is an essential and effective tool, requiring dedicated time, funding and workforce. Involving local health workers is a key enabler, as is collaborating with community leaders to map social groups and tailor vaccination strategies to their needs. Vaccination team recruitment and training strategies need to be enhanced to support vaccination campaigns. Although recognised as challenging, integrating vaccination campaigns with other routine health services can be highly beneficial if well planned and coordinated across health programmes and with communities. CONCLUSION: As supplies of COVID-19 vaccines become available to LMICs, countries need to prepare to efficiently roll out the vaccine, encourage uptake among eligible groups and respond to potential community concerns. Lessons from the implementation of these three vaccines that targeted adults in LMICs can be used to inform best practice for COVID-19 and other epidemic vaccination campaigns.","output":"Learn from the lessons and dont forget them: identifying transferable lessons for COVID-19 from meningitis A, yellow fever and Ebola virus disease vaccination campaigns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as novel biological targets are hardly applied in diagnostic and treatment of diseases, as they are difficult to be accurately detected and regulated.

The search was conducted using the following databases, Medline (OVID), EmCare for Nurses (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane, and PubMed. The search strategies included the use of truncations, adjacency search parameters, and Boolean operators using a range of key search terms. Predetermined eligibility criteria were applied to all studies. The review process was managed using Covidence systematic review software. Data extraction and quality assessment was conducted across all included studies. Data were analyzed using a narrative synthesis approach. CONCLUSION: This review has made an important contribution by identifying the role that FCNs play in care delivery as trusted members of their communities who act as a conduit at the intersect of faith and health care. Irrespective of the location or faith denomination, what was common to FCNs was that they delivered care to address the physical, psychological, spiritual, congregational, communication, health system, and family-related needs of those in their care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The nurses represented in the included studies expressed concerns that patients experienced unmet supportive care needs because of a fragmented and highly complex existing health care system. Often, FCNs provided a valuable contribution in supporting patients in their care pathways and facilitated continuity of care among people who lived with preexisting comorbidities and who had complex health care needs.

METHODS: Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were measured using internet search volumes in Google Trends. RESULTS: We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

In this critical review, we discussed the advantages and limitations in the implementation of salivary diagnostic platforms of COVID-19. The diagnostic test of COVID-19 by invasive nasopharyngeal collection is uncomfortable for patients and requires specialized training of healthcare professionals in order to obtain an appropriate collection of samples. Additionally, these professionals are in close contact with infected patients or suspected cases of COVID-19, leading to an increased contamination risk for frontline healthcare workers. Although there is a colossal demand for novel diagnostic platforms with non-invasive and self-collection samples of COVID-19, the implementation of the salivary platforms has not been implemented for extensive scale testing. Up to date, several cross-section and clinical trial studies published in the last 12 months support the potential of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva as a biomarker for COVID-19, providing a self-collection, non-invasive, safe, and comfortable procedure. Therefore, the salivary diagnosis is suitable to protect healthcare professionals and other frontline workers and may encourage patients to get tested due to its advantages over the current invasive methods. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva was substantial also in patients with a negative nasopharyngeal swab, indicating the presence of false negative results. Furthermore, we expect that salivary diagnostic devices for COVID-19 will continue to be used with austerity without excluding traditional gold standard specimens to detect SARS-CoV-2.","output":"One-Year Update on Salivary Diagnostic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following article addresses the phenomenon of increasingly multicultural, organizational teams in digitalized work contexts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 568 surgical procedures for unilateral inguinal hernia repair using the Valenti (group V) or the Lichtenstein technique (group L) were performed. After the mean follow-up time of 9 years (8-12), 185 patients (70.1%) treated using Valenti method and 186 patients (71.3%) treated using Lichtenstein method were clinically assessed. All clinical data were registered in National Hernia Registry. The rate of recurrence was assessed as primary outcome. The secondary outcome involved chronic pain (VAS). RESULTS 9-year recurrence rate was 2.2% in both groups. No significant difference in recurrence rate was demonstrated in analysis adjusted for surgeon's education, type of hernia, hernia size, hernia duration, or BMI between two groups (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.67; p = 1.0). In follow-up the majority of patients reported no pain (71.9% in V; 73.7% in L). A constant pain was reported by four patients in each group. Severe pain was reported by 1.6% in V and 2.1% in L (p = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS Inguinal hernia repairs using Valenti and Lichtenstein methods show high, long-term effectiveness and do not significantly differ in the recurrence rate. Both methods ensure a low rate of chronic pain. The use of a single mesh size with a precisely defined shape and of a uniform mesh fixation method ensures the standardization of surgical technique. The Valenti method is an uncomplicated, technically reproducible procedure with a low learning curve.","output":"Long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of Lichtenstein repair vs the Valenti technique for inguinal hernia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We adopt a novel identification strategy to examine the heterogeneous effects of Canadas COVID\\\\19 economic shutdown on hours worked across the earnings distribution.

It is therefore important to evaluate associated cognitive factors. We aimed to obtain first endorsement rate estimates of coronavirus-related conspiracy beliefs in a German-speaking general population sample and investigate whether delusion-related reasoning biases and paranoid ideation are associated with such beliefs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional non-probability online study, quota-sampled for age and gender, with 1684 adults from Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. We assessed general and specific coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, reasoning biases [jumping-to-conclusions bias (JTC), liberal acceptance bias (LA), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), possibility of being mistaken (PM)], and paranoid ideation, using established experimental paradigms and self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Around 10% of our sample endorsed coronavirus-related CT beliefs at least strongly, and another 20% to some degree. Overall endorsement was similar to levels observed in a UK-based study (Freeman et al., 2020b). Higher levels of conspiracy belief endorsement were associated with greater JTC, greater LA, greater BADE, higher PM, and greater paranoid ideation. Associations were mostly small to moderate and best described by non-linear relationships. CONCLUSIONS: A noticeable proportion of our sample recruited in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland endorsed coronavirus conspiracy beliefs strongly or to some degree. These beliefs are associated with reasoning biases studied in delusion research. The non-probability sampling approach limits the generalizability of findings. Future longitudinal and experimental studies investigating conspiracy beliefs along the lines of reasoning are encouraged to validate reasoning aberrations as risk factors.","output":"Coronavirus conspiracy beliefs in the German-speaking general population: endorsement rates and links to reasoning biases and paranoia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This review focuses on the pro-tumorigenic action of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs were found in various samples of human and animal tumors. The role of the NETs in tumor development increasingly includes cancer immunoediting and interactions between immune system and cancer cells. NETs awake dormant cancer cells, play a key regulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by enhancing cancer migration and invasion capacity. Furthermore, NETs induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in tumor cells. NET proteinases can also degrade the extracellular matrix, promoting cancer cell extravasation. Moreover, NETs can entrap circulating cancer cells and, in that way, facilitate metastasis. A better understanding of the crosstalk between cancer and NETs can help to devise novel approaches to the therapeutic interventions that block cancer evasion mechanisms and prevent metastatic spread. ABSTRACT: The present review highlights the complex interactions between cancer and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Neutrophils constitute the first line of defense against foreign invaders using major effector mechanisms: phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETs formation. NETs are composed from decondensed nuclear or mitochondrial DNA decorated with proteases and various inflammatory mediators. Although NETs play a crucial role in defense against systemic infections, they also participate in non-infectious conditions, such as inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Cancer cells recruit neutrophils (tumor-associated neutrophils, TANs), releasing NETs to the tumor microenvironment. NETs were found in various samples of human and animal tumors, such as pancreatic, breast, liver, and gastric cancers and around metastatic tumors. The role of the NETs in tumor development increasingly includes cancer immunoediting and interactions between the immune system and cancer cells. According to the accumulated evidence, NETs awake dormant cancer cells, causing tumor relapse, as well as its unconstrained growth and spread. NETs play a key regulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, such as the development of distant metastases through the secretion of proteases, i.e., matrix metalloproteinases and proinflammatory cytokines. NETs, furthermore, directly exacerbate tumor aggressiveness by enhancing cancer migration and invasion capacity. The collected evidence also states that through the induction of the high-mobility group box 1, NETs induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in tumor cells and, thereby, potentiate their invasiveness. NET proteinases can also degrade the extracellular matrix, promoting cancer cell extravasation. Moreover, NETs can entrap circulating cancer cells and, in that way, facilitate metastasis. NETs directly trigger tumor cell proliferation through their proteases or activating signals. This review focused on the pro-tumorigenic action of NETs, in spite of its potential to also exhibit an antitumor effect. NET components, such as myeloperoxidase or histones, have been shown to directly kill cancer cells. A better understanding of the crosstalk between cancer and NETs can help to devise novel approaches to the therapeutic interventions that block cancer evasion mechanisms and prevent metastatic spread. This review sought to provide the most recent knowledge on the crosstalk between NETs and cancer, and bring more profound ideas for future scientists exploring this field.","output":"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) in Cancer Invasion, Evasion and Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out from Wuhan in Hubei province, China, spread nationwide and then gradually developed into other countries in the world. The implementation of unprecedented strict isolation measures has affected many aspects of people's lives and posed a challenge to psychological health. To explore whether people isolated for 14 days due to having contact with COVID-19 patients had more psychosocial problems. We conducted an online survey from February 29 to March 10, 2020. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and coping style were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire-20-Chinese Version. This study included 1,315 isolated respondents in Hubei province (58.5% located in Wuhan). 69.3% respondents isolated at home, 30.7% respondents isolated at centralized quarantined spot. Of all respondents, 66.8% reported depressive symptoms, 49.7% reported anxiety symptoms, 89.0% reported PTSD symptoms. The Cronbach  of the IES-R, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and total SCSQ-20 were 0.935, 0.847, 0.843, and 0.888, respectively. Persons who isolated at home were associated with a lower risk of PTSD, depressive and anxiety symptoms (P < 0.01). People who knew someone to have COVID-19 were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD symptoms (P = 0.001). As for coping style, higher level of passive coping style was associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety (P < 0.001).

For governments, in order to deal with the outbreak and protect the population, it is important to predict the number of infectious cases in the future to monitor the COVID-19 situation. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of the logistic and the delay logistic time series in predicting the total number of infectious cases by using actual data from four countries, i.e. Thailand, South Korea, Egypt, and Nigeria. The total number of COVID-19 cases was collected during the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. The validation and accuracy of the predictive growth curve time series were determined based on statistical values, i.e. the coefficient of determination and the root mean squared percentage error. It was found that the logistic time series was more appropriate for predicting the first wave in the four countries. For the second wave, the delay logistic time series was preferable. Moreover, the confidence interval based on Chebyshevs inequality of delay time between the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak is also proposed. ? 2021 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services, ISSN: 2337-5760,.","output":"Delay time parameter and its confidence interval of predictive time series of covid-19 outbreak between the first and the second wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various methods for preparing fibrous materials [substrates in which polymer filaments of various nature are decorated with particles and/or layers of metallic silver (Ag)] are compared and analyzed.

The primary objective of the COVID-19 Ring-based Prevention Trial with lopinavir/ritonavir (CORIPREV-LR) is to evaluate the efficacy of a 14-day course of oral lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP against COVID-19 among individuals with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed case. Methods: : This is an open-label, multicenter, 1:1 cluster-randomized trial of LPV/r versus no intervention, using an adaptive approach to sample size calculation. Participants will be individuals aged >6 months with a high-risk exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case within the past 7 days. A combination of remote and in-person study visits at days 1, 7, 14, 35 and 90 include comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, microbiologic and serologic sampling. The primary outcome is microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection within 14 days after exposure, defined as a positive respiratory tract specimen for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Secondary outcomes include safety, symptomatic COVID-19, seropositivity, hospitalization, respiratory failure requiring ventilator support, mortality, psychological impact, and health-related quality of life. Additional analyses will examine the impact of LPV/r on these outcomes in the subset of participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. To detect a relative risk reduction of 40% with 80% power at =0.05, assuming p 0 =15%, 5 contacts per case and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.05, we require 110 clusters per arm, or 220 clusters overall and approximately 1220 enrollees after accounting for 10% loss-to-follow-up. We will modify the sample size target after 60 clusters, based on preliminary estimates of p0, ICC and cluster size and consider switching to an alternative drug after interim analyses and as new data emerges. The primary analysis will be a generalized linear mixed model with logit link to estimate the effect of LPV/r on the probability of infection. Discussion: Harnessing safe, existing drugs such as LPV/r as PEP could provide an important tool for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel aspects of our design include the ring-based prevention approach, and the incorporation of remote strategies for conducting study visits and biospecimen collection.

Based on two seemingly disparate cases, South Africa and Canada, I suggest that these expansions provide valuable opportunities for rethinking existing approaches to livelihoods, labour and social protection. These interventions also provide political possibilities through which a more radically redistributive politics can be articulated. In both contexts, state responses have provoked new challenges, dialogues, and experiments in distribution at multiple scales, from the neighbourhood to the nation state. This reflection calls for deeper inquiry into the multiple meanings of cash transfers and the political openings they provide.

The pandemic may result in a long-term disproportionate negative impact to students applying to Medical School from a low-socioeconomic background. In addition, the upsurge in Medical School applications increases the likelihood of stricter University entry criteria over the coming years. There is no current research to determine how widening participation of Medicine to students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds can be improved virtually. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of COVID-19 on students enrolled in UK widening access schemes and the role of virtual student led initiatives in widening participation. METHODS: A voluntary online survey was distributed to UK Sixth Form students (N = 31) enrolled in a widening access scheme who attended Sheffield Neuroscience Society International Virtual Conference in February 2021. The event was free to attend. The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets and an educational manipulation check. RESULTS: There were 30 pre-conference and 26 post-conference responses. 76.7 % had work experience cancelled due to COVID-19. A total of 36.7 % of participants reported participating in virtual work experience. Observe GP and Medic Mentor were each specified as attended virtual opportunities in 20 % of answers. Post conference, students felt significantly more confident in applying to Medical School (p = 0.008) and more prepared to undertake a presentation (p = 0.002). Educational manipulation check scores increased significantly (p = 0.003). 100 % of students felt inspired to do further CV building activities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has negatively impacted pupils enrolled in UK Medical School widening access schemes. Virtual student led initiatives can instill confidence in delegates from low socio-economic backgrounds, increase their career knowledge and inspire them to take part in further CV building exercises. Both Medical Schools and medical students play a key role in widening participation.

Medical records were reviewed for consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large healthcare system in Texas. The main outcome was progression to critical disease within 10 days from admission. Albumin trends from admission to 7 days were analyzed using mixed-effects models, and progression to critical disease was modeled by multivariable logistic regression of laboratory results.

By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic polymutant spike proteins that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as currently circulating variants of concern (VOC). Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients. Strikingly however, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination, neutralized this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant, and also neutralized diverse sarbecoviruses. Thus, optimally elicited human polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be resilient to substantial future SARS-CoV-2 variation and may confer protection against future sarbecovirus pandemics.","output":"High genetic barrier to escape from human polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 1918 Influenza pandemic had long-term impacts on the cohort exposed in utero which experienced earlier adult mortality, and more diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and depression after age 50.

Its safety and effectiveness have not been adequately evaluated in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The authors hypothesized that intrathecal morphine would decrease postoperative morphine consumption after minimally invasive cardiac surgery. METHODS In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial, patients undergoing robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass received either intrathecal morphine (5 mcg/kg) or intrathecal saline before surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative morphine equivalent consumption in the first 24 h after surgery; secondary outcomes included pain scores, side effects, and patient satisfaction. Pain was assessed via visual analog scale at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after intensive care unit arrival. Opioid-related side effects (nausea/vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, respiratory depression) were assessed daily. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with the Revised American Pain Society Outcome Questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients were randomized to receive intrathecal morphine (n = 37) or intrathecal placebo (n = 42), with 70 analyzed (morphine 33, placebo 37). Intrathecal morphine patients required significantly less median (25th to 75th percentile) morphine equivalents compared to placebo during first postoperative 24 h (28 [16 to 46] mg vs. 59 [41 to 79] mg; difference, -28 [95% CI, -40 to -18]; P < 0.001) and second postoperative 24 h (0 [0 to 2] mg vs. 5 [0 to 6] mg; difference, -3.3 [95% CI, -5 to 0]; P < 0.001), exhibited significantly lower visual analog scale pain scores at rest and cough at all postoperative timepoints (overall treatment effect, -4.1 [95% CI, -4.9 to -3.3] and -4.7 [95% CI, -5.5 to -3.9], respectively; P < 0.001), and percent time in severe pain (10 [0 to 40] vs. 40 [20 to 70]; P = 0.003) during the postoperative period. Mild nausea was more common in the intrathecal morphine group (36% vs. 8%; P = 0.004).

Yet, studies in many countries document a fragmented and inconsistent approach to PC teaching. The goal of this study is to assess PC education, experience, and comfort levels in providing end-of-life care in recently graduated medical students. METHODS: A survey was distributed to medical student applicants to residency programs at a large academic medical center in the United Arab Emirates. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate variable frequencies. RESULTS: Of 226 surveys, 183 were completed (80.7% response). Over half of respondents (104/183, 56.8%) did not receive any formal PC education or training in medical school. General introduction to PC (64%), pain management (68%), and non-pain symptom management (56%) were the most common topics. Only 13% (24/183) of medical students participated in PC rotations. Only 25% of participants (46/183) reported assessment of PC knowledge or skills. Gender differences were noted, with women more comfortable discussing prognosis (Pearson Chi-square value 8.67, df 3, p < 0.013) and assessing decision-making capacity (Pearson Chi-square value 15.02, df 3, p < 0.005).

Right-left lung aeration asymmetry and poorly recruitable lungs with increased recruitability with alternating body position between supine and prone have been reported. However, real-time effects of changing body position and PEEP on regional overdistension and collapse, in individual patients, remain largely unknown and not timely monitored. The aim of this study was to individualize PEEP and body positioning in order to reduce the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury: collapse and overdistension. METHODS: We here report a series of five consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in which sixteen decremental PEEP titrations were performed in the first days of mechanical ventilation (8 titration pairs: supine position immediately followed by 30 targeted lateral position). The choice of lateral tilt was based on X-Ray. This targeted lateral position strategy was defined by selecting the less aerated lung to be positioned up and the more aerated lung to be positioned down. For each PEEP level, global and regional collapse and overdistension maps and percentages were measured by electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, we present the incidence of lateral asymmetry in a cohort of forty-four patients. RESULTS: The targeted lateral position strategy resulted in significantly smaller amounts of overdistension and collapse when compared with the supine one: less collapse along the PEEP titration was found within the left lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.014); and less overdistension along the PEEP titration was found within the right lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.005). Regarding collapse within the right lung and overdistension within the left lung: no differences were found for position.

The most effective anti-inflammatory drugs employed so far in severe COVID-19 belong to the cytokine-directed biological agents, widely used in the management of many autoimmune diseases. In this paper we analyze the efficacy of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea leaves and a well-known antioxidant, in counteracting autoimmune diseases, which are dominated by a massive cytokines production. Indeed, many studies registered that EGCG inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) transcription factors, whose activities are crucial in a multiplicity of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Importantly, the safety of EGCG/green tea extract supplementation is well documented in many clinical trials, as discussed in this review. Since EGCG can restore the natural immunological homeostasis in many different autoimmune diseases, we propose here a supplementation therapy with EGCG in COVID-19 patients. Besides some antiviral and anti-sepsis actions, the major EGCG benefits lie in its anti-fibrotic effect and in the ability to simultaneously downregulate expression and signaling of many inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, EGCG can be considered a potential safe natural supplement to counteract hyper-inflammation growing in COVID-19.","output":"Protective Effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) in Diseases with Uncontrolled Immune Activation: Could Such a Scenario Be Helpful to Counteract COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cervical cancer represents one of the most important female genital cancers. Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) accounts for about 90% of all cervical malignancies and the prognosis are unsatisfied. Here we aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of metallothionein-like 5 (MTL5), a novel metallothionein-like protein, in CESC. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining showed that MTL5 was upregulated in CESC tissues than nontumorous cervix tissues, which is consistent with the data from TCGA database. KaplanCMeier survival analysis revealed that higher MTL5 can help predict worse prognosis. In addition, Cox hazard regression analysis verified an independent predictive role of MTL5 in CESC. To further investigate the involvement of MTL5 in CESC, we conducted knockdown experiments in two CESC cell lines. As a result, silencing MTL5g significantly inhibited proliferation of CESC cells. Finally, we validated that silencing MTL5 can suppress CESC tumor growth in vivo using the mice subcutaneous xenografts model. Taken together, higher MTL5 indicates worse survival of CESC after surgical resection.

METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. From March 9 to April 10, 2020, all patients referred to our institution for a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms underwent a chest CT for triage. Patients with a/parenchymal lesion characteristics of COVID-19 involving at least 50% of lung parenchyma and b/positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively included. Adrenal glands were reviewed by two independent readers to look for AAI. Additional demographics and potential biological markers of adrenal insufficiency were obtained. Correlations with ICU stay and mortality were sought. RESULTS: Out of the 219 patients with critical (n = 52) and severe lung (n = 167) parenchyma lesions, 51 (23%) had CT scan signs of AAI, which was bilateral in 45 patients (88%). Four patients had an acute biological adrenal gland insufficiency (8%). Univariate analysis in AAI+ patients demonstrated a higher rate of ICU stay (67% vs. 45%, p < 0.05) and a longer stay (more than 15 days for 31% for AAI+ vs. 19%, p < 0.05) compared with AAI- patients.

METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days; analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith. RESULTS: In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization; 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41% of those with an appendicolith and 25% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.98); the higher rate in the antibiotics group could be attributed to those with an appendicolith (20.2 vs. 3.6 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 5.69; 95% CI, 2.11 to 15.38) and not to those without an appendicolith (3.7 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.43).

METHODS: We performed a search of currently published food allergen ladders and obtained published information and clinical expertise to summarize current knowledge and suggest future standardized approaches for using food allergen ladders. RESULTS: There are currently a limited number of published milk, egg, wheat and soy ladders. We suggest the following points should be considered when developing food ladders: 1) Food allergen: dose, time and temperature of heating of the food allergen, simplicity of the ladder and recipes, the possible role of the wheat matrix and testing for allergenic protein levels to standardize doses; 2) Nutritional factors: health and nutritional value of the foods in the ladder, taste, texture and cultural appropriateness of foods should be considered; 3) Medical aspects: consideration of which patients are safe to undergo ladders outside of the clinical setting, other safety aspects and risk factors for severe reactions, number of days suggested per steps and availability and provision of rescue medication.

We therefore investigated the association of WED with  HRCT score and predictors of a worse  HRCT score in those patients. METHODS We used an inception cohort of early SSc-ILD patients with availability for two HRCT records at enrollment and 1-year follow-up.The extent of ground glass, reticulation, bronchiectasis, and honeycombing was scored and then aggregated to produce a total HRCT score. The WED was measured at four levels and the maximum value was used. The  maximum WED,  mean WED, and  tHRCT score were analyzed. RESULTS We recruited 75 early SSc-ILD patients and found a significant correlation of  tHRCT score with a  maximum WED (rho = 0.34, p < 0.01) and  mean WED (rho = 0.26, p < 0.05). There were 34 patients with a worsening  tHRCT ( > 0), 17 with stability ( = 0), and 24 with improvement ( < 0). Patients with a worsening ILD had a significantly shorter disease duration, lower prevalence of tendon friction rub, higher cumulative prednisolone dose, and larger WED than those with stable and improved  tHRCT scores. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression identified a larger  mean WED (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.42, p = 0.02) as a predictor of worsening HRCT score, while presence of tendon friction rub was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.77, p = 0.021).

We evaluated the internal consistency using standardized Cronbach's alpha coefficients and structural validity using confirmatory factor analysis. Discriminative validity was assessed by comparing the measured scores between age groups, gender, education levels, income groups, and job positions. In addition, we confirmed the criterion validity by investigating its association with self-reported health using simple and multiple logistic regression models. Most of the participants were female (73.3%), young (average 28.5 years old), and had education levels of college or higher (53.5%). We observed sufficient internal consistency in effort, reward, and over-commitment scales (Cronbach's alpha 0.80, 0.76, and 0.68, respectively). Confirmatory factor analysis of the three-factor hierarchical model showed an acceptable fit and fair construct validity with most moderate or stronger (>0.3) factor loading coefficients. Poor self-rated health was more likely in respondents in both Effort-Reward ratio's middle tertile (adjusted Odd-Ratio = 2.80, p-value = 0.031) and highest tertile (adjusted Odd-Ratio = 2.64, p-value = 0.05), adjusting for age, gender, and education levels. The Effort-reward imbalance scale has adequate reliability and validity for assessing work stress among nurses in Vietnam. Its significant association with poor self-rated health warrants further investigation. The validated instrument can help measure the effort-reward imbalance to manage better work-related emotional strains and mental health issues among nurses and ensure human resources' stability in healthcare in Vietnam.","output":"Translation, validation and psychometric properties of Effort-Reward Imbalance questionnaire among nurses in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new reality of cybersuicide raises challenges to ideologies about the traditional form of suicide that does not involve the internet (offline suicide), which may lead to changes in audience's attitudes. However, knowledge on whether stigmatizing attitudes differ between cybersuicides and offline suicides remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to consider livestreamed suicide as a typical representative of cybersuicide and use social media data (Sina Weibo) to investigate the differences in stigmatizing attitudes across cybersuicides and offline suicides in terms of attitude types and linguistic characteristics. METHODS: A total of 4393 cybersuicide-related and 2843 offline suicide-related Weibo posts were collected and analyzed. First, human coders were recruited and trained to perform a content analysis on the collected posts to determine whether each of them reflected stigma. Second, a text analysis tool was used to automatically extract a number of psycholinguistic features from each post. Subsequently, based on the selected features, a series of classification models were constructed for different purposes: differentiating the general stigma of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide and differentiating the negative stereotypes of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide. RESULTS: In terms of attitude types, cybersuicide was observed to carry more stigma than offline suicide (21=179.8; P<.001). Between cybersuicides and offline suicides, there were significant differences in the proportion of posts associated with five different negative stereotypes, including stupid and shallow (21=28.9; P<.001), false representation (21=144.4; P<.001), weak and pathetic (21=20.4; P<.001), glorified and normalized (21=177.6; P<.001), and immoral (21=11.8; P=.001). Similar results were also found for different genders and regions. In terms of linguistic characteristics, the F-measure values of the classification models ranged from 0.81 to 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: The way people perceive cybersuicide differs from how they perceive offline suicide. The results of this study have implications for reducing the stigma against suicide.","output":"Stigmatizing Attitudes Across Cybersuicides and Offline Suicides: Content Analysis of Sina Weibo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Theorizing complex phenomena like humanCenvironment relationships is difficult and often of dubious explanatory value. If our goal is to understand causal interactions between people and the land and to explain environmental changes in the landscape, the more pressing need is for better causalCanalytic methodology, not for more or better theory per se. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents a research methodology based on causalChistorical analysis, called Abductive Causal Eventism (ACE), and makes the case that social scientists and environmental change researchers may benefit from adopting this instead of a theory-focused approach. METHODS: ACE is described and its application illustrated by recent research on land use change and reforestation in Saint Lucia, West Indies. Key findings are related to the literature on so-called forest transitions (FTs). RESULTS: Early writings about FTs sought to theorize the phenomenon, but studies have since revealed that FTs are the outcome of diverse causal pathways and contingent events. Likewise, Saint Lucias recent FT reflects a variety of causal influences interacting in complex ways, and FTs have occurred there before. CONCLUSIONS: These findings counsel against hasty theorizing and policy prescription and highlight the advantages of a methodological approach (ACE) that is adaptable to different and changing contexts and accounts for both general and contingent causes. Theories and policy that emerge from ACE research will be the richer (and wiser) for it.","output":"Explaining land use and forest change: more theory or better methodology?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional research aims to study the effect of yoga practice on the illness perception, and wellbeing of healthy adults during 4-10 weeks of lockdown due to COVID19 outbreak. A total of 668 adults (64.7% males, M = 28.12 years, SD = 9.09 years) participated in the online survey. The participants were grouped as;yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as;long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, & stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.","output":"Yoga an effective strategy for self-management of stress-related problems and well-being during COVID19 lockdown: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused disruption in healthcare throughout the world.

This review highlights published guidelines regarding the provision of radiotherapy for BC patients and their adoption by radiation oncology centers. Recent Findings Multiple international and national consortiums plus select institutions have published formal recommendations regarding radiation therapy for BC during the COVID-19 pandemic. They embody the principles of limiting in-person visits, proper triage, and the judicious use of delay, abbreviation, or omission of RT as appropriate. Summary Since the start of the pandemic, multiple publications have provided guidance regarding RT for BC during this challenging time.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the lungs, and the gastrointestinal tract to some extent. Rapid structural mutations have increased the virulence and infectivity of the virus drastically. One such mutated strain known as the UK variant has caused many deaths in the United Kingdom. HYPOTHESIS: Among several indigenous natural ingredients used for prevention and cure of many diseases, the catechins have been reported for their antiviral activity, even against SARS-CoV-2. Characteristic mutations present on the spike protein have presented the newer strain its enhanced infectivity. The spike protein helps the virus bind to ACE2 receptor of the host cell and hence is a drug target. Catechins have been reported for their entry-inhibitory activity against several viruses. METHOD: In this study, we performed molecular docking of different catechins with the wild and mutant variants of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The stability of the best docked complexes was validated using molecular dynamics simulation. RESULTS: The in-silico studies show that the catechins form favourable interactions with the spike protein and can potentially impair its function. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) showed the best binding among the catechins against both the strains. Both the protein-ligand complexes were stable throughout the simulation time frame.

This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of environmental sustainability that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","output":"High health expenditures and low exposure of population to air pollution as critical factors that can reduce fatality rate in COVID-19 pandemic crisis: a global analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has been associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including perinatal loss.

However, arterial pressure stabilization occurs due to an increase in systemic vascular resistance, which could eventually compromise microcirculatory blood flow and perfusion. The goal of this study was to determine if HVHF deteriorates sublingual microcirculation in severe hyperdynamic septic shock patients. METHODS This was a prospective, non-randomized study at a 16-bed, medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. We included 12 severe hyperdynamic septic shock patients (norepinephrine requirements > 0.3 g/kg/min and cardiac index > 3.0 L/min/m2) who underwent a 12-hour HVHF as a rescue therapy according to a predefined algorithm. Sublingual microcirculation (Microscan for NTSC, Microvision Medical), systemic hemodynamics and perfusion parameters were assessed at baseline, at 12 hours of HVHF, and 6 hours after stopping HVHF. RESULTS Microcirculatory flow index increased after 12 hours of HVHF and this increase persisted 6 hours after stopping HVHF. A similar trend was observed for the proportion of perfused microvessels. The increase in microcirculatory blood flow was inversely correlated with baseline levels. There was no significant change in microvascular density or heterogeneity during or after HVHF. Mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance increased while lactate levels decreased after the 12-hour HVHF. CONCLUSIONS The use of HVHF as a rescue therapy in patients with severe hyperdynamic septic shock does not deteriorate sublingual microcirculatory blood flow despite the increase in systemic vascular resistance.","output":"Sublingual microcirculatory changes during high-volume hemofiltration in hyperdynamic septic shock patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We have conducted a survey of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in 2005 in Europe with the intention of initiating a regular series of surveys to track usage of the technique. METHODS Information was obtained from 234 centres in 18 counties. The returning centres served 27% of the population of their countries, and estimates of the numbers of MPS per million of population (pmp) were made assuming that the population not reported either performed no studies (lower estimate) or the same number pmp as the reporting centres (upper estimate). RESULTS Estimates of MPS for the countries surveyed ranged from a lower limit of 373 pmp to an upper limit of 1,388 pmp. There were marked variations between countries with higher numbers (lower limit of estimate above the mid range of all countries combined) in Austria, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Sweden and Slovenia, and lower numbers (upper limit of estimate below the mid range of all countries) in Finland, Germany and Poland. The ratio of MPS to coronary angiography to revascularisation procedures was 0.6 to 1.5 to 1. The median number of studies per centre was 496, with 32% of centres performing fewer than 250 studies in the year. The median waiting time for routine studies was 21 days and for urgent studies 3.4 days. Fifty-three percent of studies used pharmacological stress, with roughly equal numbers of adenosine and dipyridamole. Eighty-two percent of studies used (99m)Tc-based tracers. Tomographic acquisition was almost universal with 65% of studies being ECG-gated and 20% attenuation-corrected. Eighteen percent of studies were reported from hard copy alone, and 60% of studies were reported without viewing the rotating planar data. CONCLUSION We conclude that relatively low numbers of MPS studies are being performed in the surveyed centres, particularly when compared with coronary angiography and revascularisation. The use of (99m)Tc-based tracers is high, but ECG-gated studies are less common. Some reporting practices are not ideal. These data will serve as a valuable baseline for future surveys, which are likely to be more complete.","output":"Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in Europe 2005: a survey of the European Council on Nuclear Cardiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To compare the effects of manual visceral therapy (MVT) associated with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms, vaginal resting pressure, and maximum voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM).

Participants were women over 18 years of age with complaint or diagnosis of UI symptoms. The primary outcome was the severity of UI symptoms, assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form. The secondary outcomes measures included the vaginal resting pressure and the maximum voluntary contraction of PFM assessed by digital manometry. RESULTS Fifty-two incontinent women participated in the study. There was no significant difference between groups in UI symptoms (F (1.74, 86.9) = 0.406; p = 0.638), vaginal resting pressure (mean difference -1.5 cmH?0 [95% confidence interval [CI] -4.5 to 1.5; p = 0.33]), and maximum voluntary contraction of PFM (median 0.0 cmH?0 [25%-75% interquartile range 0.0-5.6; p = 0.12]) after the intervention period.

This interviewer-administered survey collected information on COVID-19 knowledge, symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and prevention behaviors, recent substance use, housing conditions, interruptions to healthcare, access to harm reduction and drug treatment, mental health, and social support. RESULTS: Of 443 current and former PWID who participated in the survey, 36 % were female, 85 % were Black, 33 % were living with HIV and 50 % reported any substance use in the prior six months. COVID-19 awareness was high, but knowledge of symptoms and routes of transmission were lower. PWID reporting recent substance use were less likely to always socially distance (63 % vs. 74 % among those without recent use, p = 0.02), and Black PWID were more likely than non-Black to socially distance (73 % vs. 48 %, p < 0.0001) and use when alone (68 % vs.35 %, p < 0.01).

Further cases have since been reported in multiple countries. The reporting rates of these events indicate that they are very rare given the high numbers of vaccinated persons. Males and younger vaccinees appear more frequently affected, more often following the second vaccine dose. As vaccine programmes progress with the focus shifting to younger people, it is possible that more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis will be reported. Objectives: To bring together spontaneously reported data from around the world to estimate the reporting rate in different countries and better understand the risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis following exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Methods: Spontaneous reports from the United Kingdom, United States, and European Economic Area were used to estimate the frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Cases were stratified by age, sex, and vaccine dose where data were available. Reporting rates amongst vaccinees receiving mRNA vaccines in each region were estimated. Results: A small number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis had been submitted to each database examined. These events are very rare according to reporting rates of spontaneous adverse reactions. The events were more frequently reported amongst males, and most reports came from vaccinees aged under 30 years. The typical clinical course of these events is mild, with full recovery in most cases. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that younger vaccinees more frequently report myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with older vaccinees.

Goodman et al. recently published a well-constructed scale with excellent psychometric properties that can be quickly administered. The main objective of our study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a Spanish version of the Goodman questionnaire in patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: The original Goodman scale was translated into Spanish and cross-culturally adapted. Then, the data from this version were tested for psychometric quality. We designed a cross-sectional study for data collection. This study enrolled 2 institutions. Patients who underwent hip replacement due to primary osteoarthritis secondary to dysplasia between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2019 were included. A total of 153 patients were contacted twice to record the Goodman and Oxford hip scales (OHS) to assess the validity of the questionnaire. Reliability was tested using the Cronbachs alpha, Concordance using 3 test: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and the Bradley-Blackwood F test. The spearman correlation was used to asses correlation between the OHS and the Spanish-adapted Goodman scale. RESULTS: The overall satisfaction after THA was reported to be very satisfied by 137 patients (75%), and only 14 patients reported some degree of dissatisfaction (6%). The improvement in quality of life was reported to be more than I ever dreamed possible by 41% patients. Cronbachs alpha was acceptable, reaching a coefficient of 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.82C1).

Tensions at home (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), difficulties isolating (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), noises inside (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-1.9) or outside the housing (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), no direct outdoor access (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0), delay in final examination (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1), reduced time for learning (OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.6), increased tobacco consumption (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6), ineffectiveness of using media entertainment (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and reading (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) to calm down, were identified as risk factors. Family (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.8-0.91) and friend (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94) support were protective factors.

The fact that the symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache, joint pain which are common in COVID-19 patients are quite similar to the symptoms of diseases such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Brucellosis. This may cause a diagnostic confusion in regions where these diseases are seen as endemic. In this report, a patient hospitalized with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 and diagnosed with acute Brucellosis, CCHF and COVID-19 during followup was presented. A 31-year-old female patient living in a rural area admitted to the emergency service with complaints of fever, weakness, headache, and body/joint pain. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.3C, a pulse rate of 102/minute, and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 97% in room air. The system examination was normal. In the laboratory findings, an increase in liver enzymes and acute phase reactants was observed and the platelet count was at the lower limit of the normal range. In terms of COVID-19, no involvement compatible with COVID-19 was detected in the thorax computed tomography (CT) of the patient whose nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal mixed swab samples were taken.The patient was transferred to our infectious diseases service with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 and CCHF. Serum samples were sent to the Public Health Agency Microbiology Reference Laboratory Department (PHA-MRLD) for CCHF diagnostic tests and supportive treatment was started. Brucella Rose Bengal and Coombs' immuncapture (1/1280 titer) tests were found as positive in the patient, who was examined for brucellosis because of living in a rural area and having a history of consuming fresh dairy products. In the tests performed at PHA-MRLD, CCHF-specific IgM positivity and the presence of viral RNA were detected. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was negative. For Brucellosis, doxycycline and rifampicin were added to the treatment of the patient whom was given supportive therapy for CCHF. In the followup, the patient's fever was persisting and loss of taste and smell complaint developed. In this context, COVID-19 test was repeated and resulted as positive. Upon this, hydroxychloroquine sulfate treatment was started due to the recommendation of the current Ministry of Health Scientific Committee Guide. No new infiltration was detected in the chest radiography of the patient. The patient's fever subsided during follow-up and laboratory findings improved. The treatment of brucellosis was completed to eight weeks at the outpatient clinic. No problems were detected in the follow-up. This report was prepared because of a case with simultaneous brucellosis, CCHF and COVID-19 infections which could not be encountered in the literature review. As a result; in regions such as our country where both brucellosis and CCHF are seen as endemic, it is very important to keep these diseases in mind in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.","output":"[The Importance of Differential Diagnosis During Pandemic: A Case Report with Coexistence of COVID-19, Brucellosis and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever]./ Pandemi D?neminde Ayirici Taninin ?nemi: COVID-19, Bruselloz ve Kirim-Kongo Kanamali Atesi Birlikteligi Olan Bir Olgu Sunumu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Whether due to aging, disability, injury, or other circumstances, an increasing number of Canadians experience functional limitations that reduce their ability to participate in activities of daily life. While the built environment has become increasingly accessible, existing Canadian evacuation guidelines lack comprehensive strategies for evacuating individuals with functional limitations from buildings during emergencies. To inform guideline revisions, a map of existing solutions for evacuating such individuals is required. Therefore, this scoping review aims to provide an account of solutions that have been reported to safely evacuate individuals with functional limitations from the built environment. METHODS We will conduct a scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework. To identify potentially relevant studies, comprehensive searches (from January 2002 onwards) of the CINAHL, Ei Compendex, Inspec, Embase, MEDLINE, KCI, RSCI, SciELO CI, Web of Science Collection, and Scopus databases will be performed. Using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers will independently (1) classify identified studies as relevant, irrelevant, or maybe relevant by evaluating their titles and abstracts and (2) classify the relevant and maybe relevant studies as included or excluded by evaluating their full-text. From each included study, data on publication information, study purpose, methodological details, evacuation information, and outcomes will be extracted using a set of data extraction items. We will present a numerical summary of the key characteristics of the included studies. For each evacuation activity, reported evacuation solutions will be summarized, and citations provided for functional limitations that are targeted by a given evacuation solution. To inform Canadian evacuation guideline revisions, we will tabulate evacuation activities common to different types of buildings and emergencies. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to identify the state and use of solutions for evacuating individuals with functional limitations from the built environment. Identifying solutions that enable all individuals to safely evacuate from different types of buildings will allow us to inform recommendations for the revision of evacuation guidelines in Canada and other jurisdictions. The findings of this scoping review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at relevant conferences, and made publicly available on the internet.

Transmission may also occur through other routes, including contaminated surfaces; nevertheless, the role that surfaces have on the spread of the disease remains contested. Here we use the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment framework to examine the risks of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through contaminated surfaces and to evaluate the effectiveness of hand and surface disinfection as potential interventions. The risks posed by contacting surfaces in communities are low (average of the median risks 1.6x10-4 - 5.6x10-9) for community infection prevalence rates ranging from 0.2-5%. Hand disinfection substantially reduces relative risks of transmission independently of the disease's prevalence and the frequency of contact, even with low (25% of people) or moderate (50% of people) compliance. In contrast, the effectiveness of surface disinfection is highly dependent on the prevalence and the frequency of contacts. The work supports the current perception that contaminated surfaces are not a primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and affirms the benefits of making hand disinfectants widely available.","output":"Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by Fomites: Risks and Risk Reduction Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The use of facemasks for infection prevention has become widely accepted.

METHODS: An anonymized survey was conducted among German private practice urologists during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The 2 test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 257 urologists were included in the final analysis. Thirty-five (14.0%) of urologists had used telemedicine as part of their consultation, and 221 (86.0%) had not used telemedicine. There was no difference between telemedicine adoption rates between rural and urban settings. Telemedicine users were significantly more satisfied with the information they had received regarding telemedicine issues. Users saw the greatest barrier to telemedicine that patients do not take up the offer of telemedicine. Nonusers were most concerned with unclear indications for telemedicine followed by lesser reimbursements during telemedicine than in-person visitations. Users were significantly more likely to use telemedicine beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists, who wanted to use the service in the future, wanted an active support by the German society of urology and guidelines for telemedicine. Last, users and nonusers preferred telemedicine for non-acute chronic diseases and follow-up visitations. CONCLUSION: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine remains a rarely used service among German private practice urologists. Ultimately, to overcome the current challenges, urologists require an active support for the service through the German Society of Urology and telemedical guidelines.","output":"Mapping Telemedicine in German Private Practice Urological Care: Implications for Transitioning beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El documento contiene los procedimiento para el manejo de las personas afectadas por COVID-19 en reas de atencin critica","output":"Manejo de personas afectadas por COVID-19 en reas de atencin crtica: Documento tcnico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the strategies of most of the teaching hospitals worldwide, affecting the educational process in residency programs.

Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation: We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have provided even more substantial health benefits, than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 21% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure while people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns and may support policy decision making in countries imposing such measures.","output":"Does Lockdown Decrease the Protective Role of ultraviolet-B (UVB) Radiation in Reducing COVID-19 Deaths?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper evaluates a wide range of audio-based deep learning frameworks applied to the breathing, cough, and speech sounds for detecting COVID-19.

The study was conducted in Ribeir?o Preto, S?o Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants' discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue.

METHODS An optical mark recognition/optical character recognition (OMR/OCR) system was developed to identify fields that were selected on 2,814 paper assessment forms, each with 141 fields which were used to assess potential COVID-19 infections. A novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate agreement between participants. RESULTS The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from crowd validation. Scanned forms were crowd-validated at a mean rate of 157 seconds per document and a volume of approximately 108 documents per day. A randomly selected subset of documents was reviewed by multiple participants, producing an interobserver agreement of 97% for documents when narrative-text fields were included and 98% when only Boolean and multiple-choice fields were considered.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether COVID-19 may impact the development of the MDR. METHODS: Blood and skin samples from COVID-19 patients (based on a positive nasopharyngeal PCR) suffering from MDR (COVID-MDR), healthy controls, non-COVID-19-related patients with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and MDR were analyzed. We utilized imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to characterize the cellular infiltrate in skin biopsies. Furthermore, RNA sequencing transcriptome of skin biopsy samples and high-throughput multiplexed proteomic profiling of serum were performed. RESULTS: IMC revealed by clustering analyses a more prominent, phenotypically shifted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell population and highly activated monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mac) clusters in COVID-MDR. The RNA sequencing transcriptome demonstrated a more robust cytotoxic response in COVID-MDR skin. However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not detected in skin biopsies at the time point of MDR diagnosis. Serum proteomic profiling of COVID-MDR patients revealed upregulation of various inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF, and IFN-?3), eosinophil and Mo/Mac -attracting chemokines (MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and CCL11). Proteomics analyses demonstrated a massive systemic cytokine storm in COVID-MDR compared with the relatively milder cytokine storm observed in DRESS, while MDR did not exhibit such features.

METHODS Eighty-one HCC patients who underwent repeat hepatectomy in our hospital from 2008 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Of these patients, 30 and 51 patients underwent LRH and ORH, respectively. We analyzed surgical outcomes of LRH and ORH, focusing on tumor characteristics such as tumor size, location, distance from major vessels, and contralateral or ipsilateral tumor recurrence to determine what factors could affect surgical outcomes. Subsequently, using a propensity-matched cohort, we compared the impact of those factors on LRH and ORH outcomes. RESULTS In the entire cohort, the LRH operation time was significantly shorter in contralateral recurrent HCC cases than in ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases (252 vs. 398 min, P = 0.008); however, such a difference was not observed in the ORH operation time. We subsequently compared the surgical outcomes, in terms of the location of tumor recurrence, between the LRH and ORH groups in a propensity-matched cohort. In total, 23 patients were included in each of these groups. We found that the LRH procedure had significantly shorter operative time than the ORH procedure in the contralateral recurrent HCC cases (253 vs. 391 min, P = 0.018); however, we did not observe such a difference in the ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases (372 vs. 333 min, P = 0.669). LRH had lower blood loss, similar postoperative complications and shorter hospital stay than ORH in both contralateral and ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases.

Two Ghanaian HEIs' implementation of CMC portals is examined using Tetteh et al's CMC portal implementation framework as well as a structuration theory adapted by Orlikowski & Robey from Giddens's work. Findings reveal an indistinct and almost absent consideration of the broader institutional goals for implementing CMC portals. It was also found that the activities involved in the adoption, implementation, and institutionalization of technology into institutional processes, are often not adequately considered, were unaligned with institutional visions, and not well understood. Strategies that can improve the utilization of CMC portal initiatives and guide implementation efforts of HEIs in Ghana are then advanced.

At Boston Medical Center, a regional safety-net hospital, the Department of Surgery created a dedicated coronavirus disease 2019 Procedure Team to ease the burden on other providers coping with the surge of infected patients. As restrictions on social distancing are lifted, health systems are bracing for additional surges in coronavirus disease 2019 cases. Our objective is to quantify the volume and types of procedures performed, review outcomes, and highlight lessons for other institutions that may need to establish similar teams. METHODS: Procedures were tracked prospectively along with patient demographics, immediate complications, and time from donning to doffing of the personal protective equipment. Retrospective chart review was conducted to obtain patient outcomes and delayed adverse events. We hypothesized that a dedicated surgeon-led team would perform invasive bedside procedures expeditiously and with few complications. RESULTS: From March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020, there were 1,196 coronavirus disease 2019 admissions. The Procedure Team performed 272 procedures on 125 patients, including placement of 135 arterial catheters, 107 central venous catheters, 25 hemodialysis catheters, and 4 thoracostomy tubes. Specific to central venous access, the average procedural time was 47 minutes, and the rate of immediate complications was 1.5%, including 1 arterial cannulation and 1 pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: Procedural complication rate was less than rates reported in the literature. The team saved approximately 192 hours of work that could be redirected to other patient care needs. In times of crisis, redeployment of surgeons (who arguably have the most procedural experience) into procedural teams is a practical approach to optimize outcomes and preserve resources.","output":"The Boston Medical Center Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Procedure Team: Optimizing the surgeon's role in pandemic care at a safety-net hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil currently has one of the fastest growing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in the world. Due to limited available data, assessments of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on virus transmission and epidemic spread remain challenging.

Mobility-driven transmission models for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cities show that the reproduction number (Rt) reached below 1 following NPIs but slowly increased to values between 1 to 1.3 (1.0 - -1.6). Genome sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset from 21 of the 27 Brazilian states identified >100 international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil.

METHODS: This study was performed at the MS Clinic of Beheshti Hospital from June 1, 2020 to November 1, 2021. 202 patients with a diagnosis of MS and negative self-reported history of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, were enrolled. First, the demographic characteristics of patients were collected. Second, the patients underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Then, a year later, they were revalauted and asked about the occurrence of clinical relapse leading to hospitalization, disease progression, DMT profile, COVID-19 vaccination, and history of COVID-19 infection. We considered six weeks after COVID-19 regarding relapse occurrence. Eventually, statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS 26.0 RESULTS: Of 202 patients, 26 patients (12.87%) had initially a positive index antibody result. During the follow-up periods, 25 patients (12.37%) were infected with COVID-19 which was mainly mild (74.8%), and significantly lower than general population. 118 patients (58.41%) were vaccinated for COVID-19 which reduced the risk of COVID-19 development (P<001). Except a case of myelitis associated with vaccination, no serious adverse event was reported. Additionally, only one patient developed MS relapse following COVID-19 infection. Except clinical relapse (P = 0.001), other demographic and MS characteristics, and DMT type were not associated with COVID-19. In terms of MS course, 12 patients (5.94%) discontinued their DMTs regardless of the DMT adverse events or treatment failure. 41 patients (20.3%) experienced a clinical relapse, of whom 12 were escalated to a second line DMT.

Here we introduce a simple-yet-powerful ensemble methodology for forecasting the trajectory of dynamic growth processes that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations with applications to infectious disease spread. METHODS: We propose and assess the performance of two ensemble modeling schemes with different parametric bootstrapping procedures for trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we conduct sequential probabilistic forecasts to evaluate their forecasting performance using simple dynamical growth models with good track records including the Richards model, the generalized-logistic growth model, and the Gompertz model. We first test and verify the functionality of the method using simulated data from phenomenological models and a mechanistic transmission model. Next, the performance of the method is demonstrated using a diversity of epidemic datasets including scenario outbreak data of the Ebola Forecasting Challenge and real-world epidemic data outbreaks of including influenza, plague, Zika, and COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that the ensemble method that randomly selects a model from the set of individual models for each time point of the trajectory of the epidemic frequently outcompeted the individual models as well as an alternative ensemble method based on the weighted combination of the individual models and yields broader and more realistic uncertainty bounds for the trajectory envelope, achieving not only better coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval but also improved mean interval scores across a diversity of epidemic datasets. CONCLUSION: Our new methodology for ensemble forecasting outcompete component models and an alternative ensemble model that differ in how the variance is evaluated for the generation of the prediction intervals of the forecasts.","output":"Ensemble bootstrap methodology for forecasting dynamic growth processes using differential equations: application to epidemic outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Steve Fund, a national advocacy organization focused on the mental health of young people of color, on Sept 15 published a report with recommendations for college leaders to better support those students who are currently facing unprecedented mental health challenges The recommendations were formed by the organization's Crisis Response Task Force, a group of students, mental health experts, colleges, nonprofits and corporate executives created to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout on the mental health of young people of color The report, Adapting and Innovating to Promote Mental Health and Emotional Well-Being of Young People of Color: COVID-19 and Beyond, also addresses the nation's ?racial reckoning? and how the death of George Floyd and wide acknowledgment of systemic racism can put additional emotional stress on those students The task force recommended that college leaders take a ?trauma-informed approach? to decision-making and show empathy toward racial injustices experienced by students of color in order to build trust Counseling centers and mental health support staff on campus should collaborate with faculty members;student affairs;and diversity, equity and inclusion staff members to respond to increased counseling center demand Antiracist policies and the promotion of inclusion and belonging overall can have a positive impact on the mental health of students of color, the report stated","output":"Task force releases report addressing MH of students of color"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-compassion is a healthy conceptualization of the self and has been associated with a myriad of health benefits.

This study investigated (1) the influence and relative strength of the relationships of the 6 subcomponents of self-compassion onto happiness, (2) the influence and relative strength of the relationships of happiness onto the 6 subcomponents of self-compassion and (3) the bi-directional relationship between total self-compassion variables and happiness across two timepoints. This study followed a pre-post design whereby 33 university students and employees undergoing a physical activity counselling (PAC) program filled out validated online questionnaires before and immediately after individualized sessions. Results revealed that there was a positive bi-directional relationship between self-compassion and happiness over time, with the stronger influence being from happiness to self-compassion. This is likely because happier individuals are kinder to themselves and strongly connected with others. Moreover, results showed that mindfulness was the strongest subcomponent of self-compassion to positively influence happiness, and happiness was the strongest negative predictor of isolation. This has practical implications in that PAC counsellors and other practitioners should try to emphasize mindfulness in their interventions to maximize feelings of happiness, and try to cultivate happiness to reduce feelings of isolation and increase total self-compassion.","output":"Self-Compassion and Happiness: Exploring the Influence of the Subcomponents of Self-Compassion on Happiness and Vice Versa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In the age of advanced digital technology, smart healthcare based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining importance to deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccinations against these pathogens are effective in older adults. Frailty seems to be an important determinant of vaccination rates, yet data supporting this association are still missing. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of four recommended vaccinations (influenza, herpes zoster, pneumococcal and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and the association with multidimensional frailty assessed using a self-reported comprehensive geriatric assessment tool, i.e., the multidimensional prognostic index (SELFY-MPI). Older participants visiting the outpatient clinic of Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, Palermo, Italy were included. The SELFY-MPI questionnaire score was calculated based on eight different domains, while the vaccination status was determined using self-reported information. We included 319 participants from the 500 initially considered (63.8%). Vaccination against influenza was observed in 70.5% of the cases, whilst only 1.3% received the vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis. Participants with higher SELFY-MPI scores were more likely to report vaccination against pneumococcus (45.6 vs. 28.3%, p = 0.01), whilst no significant differences were observed for the other vaccinations. In conclusion, the coverage of recommended vaccinations is low. Higher SELFY-MPI scores and vaccination status, particularly anti-pneumococcus, appear to be associated, but future studies are urgently needed for confirming that frailty is associated with vaccination status in older people.","output":"Multidimensional Frailty and Vaccinations in Older People: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is ongoing debate regarding the role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in the health care environment.

Schooling was translocated to the students' homes where students were supposed to work on learning tasks provided by their teachers. Students' self-regulation and attributes of the learning tasks may be assumed to have played important roles when adapting to this novel schooling situation. They may be predicted to have influenced students' daily self-regulation and hence the independence with which they worked on learning tasks. The present work investigated the role of students' trait self-regulation as well as task difficulty and task enjoyment for students' daily independence from their parents in learning during the homeschooling period. Data on children's trait self-regulation were obtained through a baseline questionnaire filled in by the parents of 535 children (M age a?= 9.69, SD age a?= 2.80). Parents additionally reported about the daily task difficulty, task enjoyment, and students' learning independence through 21 consecutive daily online questionnaires. The results showed students' trait self-regulation to be positively associated with their daily learning independence. Additionally, students' daily learning independence was shown to be negatively associated with task difficulty and positively with task enjoyment. The findings are discussed with regard to students' daily self-regulation during the homeschooling period.

One type of those commonly emerging and re-emerging pathogens are coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Wild animals are hosts of different coronaviruses with the potential risk of cross-species transmission. However, little is known about the reservoir and host of coronaviruses in wild animals in Qinghai Province, where has the greatest biodiversity among the world's high-altitude regions. Here, from the next-generation sequencing data, we obtained a known beta-coronavirus (beta-CoV) genome and a novel delta-coronavirus (delta-CoV) genome from faecal samples of 29 marmots, 50 rats and 25 birds in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China in July 2019. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the beta-CoV shared high nucleotide identity with Coronavirus HKU24. Although the novel delta-CoV (MtCoV) was closely related to Sparrow deltacoronavirus ISU42824, the protein spike of the novel delta-CoV showed highest amino acid identity to Sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (73.1%). Interestingly, our results identified a novel host (Montifringilla taczanowskii) for the novel delta-CoV and the potential cross-species transmission. The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of MtCoVs along with other closest members of the species of Coronavirus HKU15 was estimated to be 289 years ago.

We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes (notably Nsp6) that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5X greater than that observed in influenza hemagglutinin HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

The multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 2 iNSPIRE study evaluated ibrutinib for prevention of respiratory failure in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: Adult patients with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen but without respiratory failure were randomized 1:1 (stratified by remdesivir prescription) to ibrutinib 420 mg or placebo once daily for up to 28 days plus standard of care (SOC), including remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were randomized to ibrutinib plus SOC (n=22) or placebo plus SOC (n=24). The primary endpoint (proportion of patients alive and without respiratory failure through day 28) was not met, with no statistically significant difference adjusting for remdesivir prescription (86% with ibrutinib plus SOC vs 79% with placebo plus SOC; adjusted difference, 5.8%; 80% CI, C9.2 to 20.4; P=.599).
