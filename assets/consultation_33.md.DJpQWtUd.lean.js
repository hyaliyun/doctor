Carfentanil was originally intended to be used as a sedative for big game animals in a veterinary setting, but it is becoming increasingly recognized as a public health concern. We set out to investigate the effectiveness of naloxone against a potentially lethal dose of inhaled carfentanil in male ferrets. Ferrets were implanted with telemetry devices to study cardiac parameters and exposed to aerosolized carfentanil in a whole-body plethysmography chamber to record respiratory parameters. We observed profound respiratory depression in exposed animals, which led to apneic periods constituting 24-31% of the exposure period. Concomitant with these apneic periods, we also observed cardiac abnormalities in the form of premature junctional contractions (PJCs). At our acute exposure dose, lethal in 3% of our animals, na?ve ferrets were unresponsive and incapacitated for a total of 126.1  24.6 minutes. When administered intramuscularly at human equivalent doses (HEDs) of either 5 mg or 10 mg, naloxone significantly reduced the time that ferrets were incapacitated following exposure, although we observed no significant difference in the reduction of time that the animals were incapacitated between the treatment groups. Naloxone was able to quickly resolve the respiratory depression, significantly reducing the frequency of apneic periods in carfentanil-exposed ferrets. Our results suggest that naloxone, when administered via intramuscular injection following incapacitation, is a viable treatment against the effects of a potentially lethal dose of inhaled carfentanil.","output":"Assessment of Naloxone as a Therapeutic for Inhaled Carfentanil in the Ferret"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the necessity of Covid-19 vaccination in children aged < 12 y by comparing the clinical characteristics in unvaccinated children aged < 12 y with vaccinated patients aged > 12y during the Delta surge (B.1.617.2) in Putian, Fujian, China.

OBJECTIVE To investigate if P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values are associated with hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications after treatment with the PED and to find an optimal range of preprocedural PRU values. METHODS Two hundred thirty-one patients with 248 cerebral aneurysms treated with the PED were retrospectively identified. Patients were started on dual-antiplatelet treatment at least 10 days before the intervention. PRU values were checked. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Youden Indices were calculated to determine cutoffs for optimal PRU values. RESULTS Mean patient age was 57 years. Mean last preprocedural PRU was 132 (range: 1-382). The combined rate of major hemorrhagic complications (4%) and major thromboembolic complications (5.6%) was 9.6%. Analysis using Youden indices suggested an optimal PRU range of 70 to 150 with higher odds of complications outside this range (P = .01, odds ratio [OR] = 3 [1.2-7.5]). PRU <60 was a significant predictor of hemorrhagic complications (P = .04, OR = 2.45 [1.01-5.9]) and PRU >240 was a significant predictor of any thromboembolic complication (P = .04, OR = 3.6 [1.04-12]) and cerebral thromboembolic complications (P = .02, OR = 4 [1.2-14]). CONCLUSION Target preoperative PRU values should be between 60 and 240 and ideally between 70 and 150. Values below this range and above it carry higher odds of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, respectively.","output":"P2Y12 Reaction Units: Effect on Hemorrhagic and Thromboembolic Complications in Patients With Cerebral Aneurysms Treated With the Pipeline Embolization Device."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report, we discovered a new entity named cataract, alopecia, oral mucosal disorder, and psoriasis\\\\like (CAOP) syndrome in two unrelated and ethnically diverse patients.

HPV decontamination was effective against bacterial spores (6 log10 reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores) on FFRs and viruses (> 4 log10 reduction of various types of viruses) on inanimate surfaces, and no degradation of respirator materials and fit has been reported. 70% or higher ethanol decontamination showed high efficacy in inactivation of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces (> 3.9 log10 reduction) but it was lower on FFRs which filtration efficiency was also decreased. UVGI method had good biocidal efficacy on FFRs (> 3 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) combined with inexpensive, readily available equipment; however, it was more time-consuming to ensure sufficient reduction in SARS-CoV-2. MGS treatment also provided good viral decontamination on FFRs (> 4 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) along with less time-intensive process and readily available equipment while inconsistent disinfection on the treated surfaces and deterioration of nose cushion of FFRs were observed. HPGP was a good virucidal system (> 6 log10 reduction of Vesicular stomatitis virus) but filtration efficiency after decontamination was inconsistent. Overall, HPV appeared to be one of the most promising methods based on the high biocidal efficacy on FFRs, preservation of respirator performance after multiple cycles, and no residual chemical toxicity. Nonetheless, equipment cost and time of the HPV process and a suitable operating room need to be considered.","output":"Decontamination of respirators amid shortages due to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To determine the COVID-19 fear level of family physicians during the pandemic working in Sivas and its relationship to their experienced problems.

Since severe cases of COVID-19 present a dysregulated immune system with T cell lymphopenia and a hyper-inflammatory state we have proposed that a similar strategy could be proven to be efficient for COVID-19 patients. This is a study protocol of an open-label, multicenter, double-arm, randomized, dose-finding phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the administration of a single dose of allogenic SARS-CoV-2 specific memory CD45RA - T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia and pneumonia. The aim of the study is to find efficient treatments for patients with moderate/severe COVID-19. Identification of Specific memory T cells and NK cells: i)Memory T Cells: we first determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells within the CD45RA - T memory cells of the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to the infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms without inducing classically T cell alloreactivity. Also, CD45RA - memory T cells confer protection for other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. ii)NK cells: we determined the phenotype of NK cells after COVID-19 and the main characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 specific NK population in the blood of convalescent donors, as it has been shown for cytomegalovirus infections. Also, NK cells confer protection for other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. Pilot Phase I- Safety, feasibility, and dose escalation: Between September and November 2020 a phase 1, dose-escalation, single-center clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the infusion of CD45RA - memory T cells containing SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells as adoptive cell therapy against moderate/severe cases of COVID-19. Nine participants with pneumonia and/or lymphopenia and with at least one human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match with the donor were infused. The first three subjects received the lowest dose (1x10 5 cells/kg), the next three received the intermediate dose (5x10 5 cells/kg) and the last three received the highest dose (1x10 6 cells/kg) of CD45RA - memory T cells. Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT04578210. Findings: All participants' clinical status measured by National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and 7-category point ordinal scales showed improvement six days after infusion. No serious adverse events were reported. Inflammatory parameters were stabilized post-infusion and the participants showed lymphocyte recovery two weeks after the procedure. Donor microchimerism was observed at least for three weeks after infusion in all patients. Interpretation: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the idea that treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate/severe symptoms using convalescent SARS-CoV-2 specific CD45RA - memory T cells is feasible and safe. We did not find dose-liming toxicity. The Recommended Phase 2 dose was 1x10 6 CD45RA - T cells. Phase II- Efficacy: Between January 2021 and July 2021 patients have been enrolled based on the matched with the HLA genotype of the convalescent donors and following the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary outcome is the incidence of patient recovery at day 14, defined as normalization of fever and oxygen saturation or lymphopenia recovery. Secondary outcomes are the time to normal level of lymphocytes, the proportion of patients showing clinical improvement at day 7, time to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events, duration of hospitalization, time to discharge, time to improvement by one category a 7-point ordinal scale or NEWS score, the proportion of patients requiring intensive care unit, and all-cause mortality. In addition, lymphocyte recovery by multiparametric flow cytometry and donor chimerism by real-time PCR in the experimental arm was monitored weekly during the first month. This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the idea that treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate/severe symptoms using convalescent CD45RA - memory T cells is safe and feasible.

METHODS: The Pediatric Emergency Research Network has grown from 5- to 8-member networks over the past decade. With an executive committee comprising representatives from all member networks, PERN plays a supportive and collaborative rather than governing role. The full impact of PERN's facilitation of international collaborative research, although somewhat difficult to quantify empirically, can be measured indirectly by the observed growth of the field, the nature of the increasingly challenging research questions now being addressed, and the collective capacity to generate and implement new knowledge in treating acutely ill and injured children. RESULTS: Beginning as a pandemic response with a high-quality retrospective case-controlled study of H1N1 influenza risk factors, PERN research has progressed to multiple observational studies and ongoing global randomized controlled trials. As a recent example, PERN has developed sufficient network infrastructure to enable the rapid initiation of a prospective observational study in response to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In light of the ongoing need for translation of research knowledge into equitable clinical practice and to promote health equity, PERN is committed to a coordinated international effort to increase the uptake of evidence-based management of common and treatable acute conditions in all emergency department settings. CONCLUSIONS: The Pediatric Emergency Research Network's successes with global research, measured by prospective observational and interventional studies, mean that the network can now move to improve its ability to promote the implementation of scientific advances into everyday clinical practice. Achieving this goal will involve focus in 4 areas: (1) expanding the capacity for global randomized controlled trials; (2) deepening the focus on implementation science; (3) increasing attention to healthcare disparities and their origins, with growing momentum toward equity; and (4) expanding PERN's global reach through addition of sites and networks from resource-restricted regions.

Although many COVID-19 patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, there was no evidence about the gallbladder and biliary tract involvement in the literature to date. Case Report A 71-year-old male was admitted to our facility and found to be positive for COVID-19. He received appropriate COVID-19 treatment with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma. The patient continued to be lethargic, weak, and had elevated inflammatory markers. The arterial blood gas (ABG) panel showed metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, and the patient appeared to be overcompensating because of his hypoxia. Consequently, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The total bilirubin started to increase over the following days and reached 8 mg/dL. The ultrasound did not show cholelithiasis. The bile culture grew Candida albicans , and the patient was diagnosed with acalculous Candida cholecystitis. The patient had a significant deterioration in clinical status and expired after being transferred to comfort care. Conclusion: Long-term complications of COVID-19 are still unknown.

The study investigates and compares the relevance and comprehensiveness of these psoriasis-specific bolt-ons and the EQ-5D-5L and explores the potential conceptual overlaps between the existing five dimensions and the two bolt-ons. METHODS: Psoriasis patients were purposively sampled according to age and gender. Semi-structured interviews, where participants were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L and the bolt-ons while thinking aloud, were conducted. Probes were used to investigate the thought processes of patients regarding the dimensions, wording, recall period and relevant concepts not captured by the EQ-5D-5L and bolt-ons. Data were analysed thematically. A focus group was used to confirm the findings. RESULTS: Overall, 16 patients completed the interviews. Sixteen and fifteen patients considered skin irritation and self-confidence relevant areas to describe psoriasis problems. Three patients considered itching a form of discomfort, and thus, pointed out a potential overlap between pain/discomfort and skin irritation. Twelve patients reported overall 10 general health- or psoriasis-related concepts that are not captured by the EQ-5D-5L, including itching, social relationships and sex life. Eleven patients reported that the recall period of the EQ-5D-5L might be subject to bias because of the daily or within-day fluctuations of their symptoms.

The epidemic degree in each area is directly affected by the number of population inflows from Wuhan and indirectly affected by the spatial spillover effect from other areas. Due to the lack of strict restrictions on population flows, the spatial spillover effect in areas outside Hubei gradually strengthened after the closure of Wuhan and exceeded the direct effect, and the intensity of population flows within Wuhan had a significant impact on the spread of the epidemic.

Objective: We sought to describe characteristics of patients with chronic respiratory disease (CRD) experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who were seen in a novel Acute Respiratory Clinic, prior to widely available testing, emergence of variants, COVID-19 vaccination, and post-vaccination (breakthrough) SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: Retrospective electronic medical record data were analyzed from 907 adults with presumed COVID-19 seen between March 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021. Data included demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests, patient disposition, and co-infections. The overdispersed data (aod) R package was used to create a logit model using COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR as the dichotomous outcome variable. Univariate, conventional multivariate and elastic net machine learning were used to analyze data. Results: Male gender, elevated baseline temperature, and respiratory rate predicted COVID-19 diagnosis. Eosinopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphocytosis were also associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. However, asthma and COPD diagnoses were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test.

METHODS: PerFECT 2.0 went live on 1 November 2016. Spoke centres submit anonymised documentation (HRCT images, pathological samples, clinical data) for a second opinion on the potential diagnosis of IPF from a hub centre. HRCT images are quickly uploaded, with patient-identifying information automatically removed. The hub centre views documentation online (no downloads allowed), makes any further information requests, then returns their second opinion as free text. An e-learning area contains educational material and simulated training clinical cases. Metrics were collected for 2017C2019; a user survey was conducted from 30 JuneC31 July 2020.

As of January 2021, there were more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 and more than two million deaths worldwide. Compared to the general population, patients with cancer are at a higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. In large cohort studies, mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer can be as high as 40%. In addition to clinical variables (older age, male sex, and co-morbidities) that are associated with mortality in general population, cancer patients are uniquely vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression from cancer and its therapy, and disruption of routine clinical care. Among patients with cancer, the lung cancer population is at a higher risk of poor outcomes and mortality from COVID-19 for several reasons. For instance, lung is the main target organ in COVID-19 that can lead to respiratory failure, patients with lung cancer have baseline poor lung function from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and smoking.

Here, we use recent data obtained by profiling antigen-specific B cell responses in hepatitis B as a framework to explore lessons that can be learnt from different viral infections about the diverse influences on humoral immunity. Hepatitis B provides a paradigm where successful B cell responses in resolved or vaccinated individuals can be contrasted to the failed response in chronic infection, while also exemplifying the degree to which B cell responses within infected individuals can differ to two antigens from the same virus. Drawing on studies in other human and murine infections, including emerging data from COVID-19, we consider the influence of antigen quantity and structure on the quality of the B cell response, the role of differential CD4 help, the importance of germinal center vs extrafollicular responses and the emerging concept that responses residing in non-lymphoid organs can participate in B cell memory.","output":"Human antiviral B cell responses: Emerging lessons from hepatitis B and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, society has undergone significant changes with implications for employee values and job satisfaction. As a reflection of social needs, corporate social practice is also changing compared to before the pandemic. This paper examines the perception of corporate social practices by personnel and their impact on staff satisfaction. The empirical study carried out in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan allowed the authors to identify social practices that influence the level of personnel satisfaction with professional activity before and after the pandemic. The research determined general tendencies and differences in the perception of social practices with the most significant personnel satisfaction in the period before and after the pandemic. The authors also developed recommendations that should be taken into account when forming corporate social practices. The studys novelty is the investigation of an empirical relationship between the levels of satisfaction with professional activity and implemented social practices in the period before and after the pandemic. The research found that the tendencies in Russia and Kazakhstan are similar to the global trends. Employees before the pandemic were highly satisfied with their activities and corporate social responsibility practices. After the pandemic, when society is disconnected and individualized, employees are focused on material security, and social practices have no significant influence on staff satisfaction.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical course and cardiac testing results in pediatric patients hospitalized with MIS-C at 2 large hospital systems in the New York City metropolitan area over a 3-month period. RESULTS: Of the 33 patients (median age 2.8 years) in the study cohort, 24 (73%) had at least one abnormality in cardiac testing: abnormal electrocardiogram (48%), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (43%), abnormal echocardiogram (30%), and/or elevated troponin (21%). Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram abnormalities all resolved by the 2-week outpatient follow-up cardiology visit. CONCLUSION: While 73% of pediatric patients with MIS-C had evidence of abnormal cardiac testing on hospital admission in our study, all cardiac testing was normal by outpatient hospital discharge follow-up.

METHODS: We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and EMCARE, to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection between December 2019 and May 2020. For accurate comparison, only those studies that had patients undergoing both CT and RT-PCR were included. Pooled diagnostic accuracy of both the tests was calculated by using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, only 11 studies consisting of 1834 patients were included in the final analysis that reported diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR, in the same set of patients. Sensitivity estimates for CT scan ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 and for RT-PCR varied ranging from 0.47 to 1.00. The pooled estimates of sensitivity for CT and RT-PCR were 0.91 [95% CI (0.84-0.97)] and 0.84 [95% CI (0.71-0.94)], respectively. On subgroup analysis, pooled sensitivity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.95 [95% CI (0.88-0.98)] and 0.91 [95% CI (0.80-0.96), p = o.ooo1]. The pooled specificity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.31 [95% CI (0.035-0.84)] and 1.00 [95% CI (0.96-1.00)]. CONCLUSION: CT is more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection, but has a very low specificity.

Clinical evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and offers benefit particularly in people with Vitamin D deficiency. Some evidence exists for a higher incidence of active TB in patients who are deficient in vitamin D. An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID-19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID-19 infections results from excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokines during Covid-19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D.

OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes associated with excipient skin testing after a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We identified a consecutive sample of patients with reported allergic reactions after the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who underwent allergy assessment with skin testing to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when appropriate, polysorbate 80. Skin testing results in conjunction with clinical phenotyping of the first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reaction guided second-dose vaccination recommendation. Second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactions were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty patients with reported first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergic reactions (n = 65; 81% immediate onset) underwent excipient skin testing. Of those, 14 (18%) had positive skin tests to PEG (n = 5) and/or polysorbate 80 (n = 12).

As the COVID-19 crisis showed, during major health disasters (MHDs), the demand for SC grows exponentially, while the burden of care and focus on preserving life often hamper its provision. Nonetheless, existing health emergency strategic frameworks lack preparedness for the provision of SC. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the components for a National Strategy (NS) for the provision of SC during MHDs. METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional, qualitative phenomenological design based on individual, semi-structured e-interviews with nursing managers and National Health Service/volunteer chaplains based in England. Thematic analysis of 25 e-interview data was performed based on a dialogic collaborative process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Eleven themes were identified as components of the proposed NS. From these components, specific recommendations for practical actions are provided. An integrated framework approach and smart investments in resources, staff training and technologies should be led by the paradigm of culturally competent and compassionate care. CONCLUSION: The need to have strategic frameworks, both national and local, that better equip a country healthcare sector to prevent, face, and recover from MHDs is paramount.

Fingerprint designs are exclusive in each human and the chance of two individuals having identical fingerprints is an exceptional case about one in sixty-four thousand million also the fingerprint minutiae patterns of the undistinguishable twins are different, and the ridge pattern of each fingertip remain unchanged from birth to till death. Fingerprints can be divided into basic four categories i.e. Loop, whorl, arch, and composites, nevertheless, there are more than 100 interleaved ridge and valleys physiognomies, called Galton's details, in a single rolled fingerprint.

The integration of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique with MEC has been shown to provide applications with lower latency and higher energy efficiency. However, existing designs of this type have mainly focused on the transmission technique, which is still insufficient. To further advance offloading performance, in this work, we propose an application-driven NOMA enabled computation offloading scheme by exploring the characteristics of applications, where the common data of the application is offloaded through multi-device cooperation. Under the premise of successfully offloading the common data, we formulate the problem as the maximization of individual offloading throughput, where the time allocation and power control are jointly optimized.

METHODS: We compared patient characteristics, glycemic control, PHQ-9 depression screen, in person and virtual outpatient encounters, hospitalizations and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) utilization in approximately 1600 patients in 1 year periods preceding and following the local imposition of COVID-related restrictions on 3/15/2020 (2019 and 2020 groups, respectively). RESULTS: In a generalized linear model, increasing age, non-commercial insurance, Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, and non-utilization of CGMs were all associated with higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), but there was no difference between the 2019 and 2020 groups. The time in range in CGM users was lower with non-commercial insurance and in Black and Hispanic patients; it improved slightly from 2019 to 2020. CGM utilization by patients with non-commercial insurance (93% of such patients were in government programs, 7% uninsured or other) increased markedly. In 2020, patients with commercial insurance (i.e., private-pay or provided by an employer) had fewer office visits, but insurance status did not influence utilization of the virtual visit platform. There was no change in hospitalization frequency from 2019 to 2020 in either commercially or non-commercially insured patients, but patients with non-commercial insurance were hospitalized at markedly higher frequencies in both years.

To avoid an overloading of the health care system and to control transmission chains, the development of rapid and cost-effective techniques allowing for the reliable diagnosis of individuals with acute respiratory infections are crucial. Uniquely, the present study focuses on a direct face mask sampling approach, as worn (i.e., used) disposable face masks contain exogenous environmental constituents, as well as endogenously exhaled breath aerosols. Optical techniques C and specifically infrared (IR) molecular spectroscopic techniques - are promising tools for direct virus detection at the surface of such masks. In the present study, a rapid and non-destructive approach for monitoring exposure scenarios via medical face masks using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy is presented. Complementarily, IR external reflection spectroscopy was evaluated in comparison for rapid mask analysis. The utility of a face mask-based sampling approach was demonstrated by differentiating water, proteins, and virus-like particles sampled onto the mask. Data analysis using multivariate statistical algorithms enabled unambiguously classifying spectral signatures of individual components and biospecies. This approach readily extends towards the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 C as shown herein for the example of virus-like particles which are morphologically equivalent to authentic virus - without any additional sample preparation or elaborate testing equipment at laboratory facilities.

This study measured the prevalence of and identified factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and social media use. An online survey was administered (n = 1050) between May and July 2021. Chi-square tests were used to examine bivariate associations with vaccine hesitancy (partially vaccinated and unvaccinated participants). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between social media use and vaccine hesitancy. Chi-square tests showed women (69.7% vs 28.2% men, p(adjusted) = .002), African American participants (52.3% vs 17.8% white, p(adjusted) < .001), high school diploma (54.4% vs 38.6% college degree, p(adjusted) < .001), political unaffiliated (15.8% vs 14.5% republican, p(adjusted) < .001), Muslim (10.0% vs 0% Jewish, p(adjusted) < .001), and never married/single (53.9% vs 17.0% married, p(adjusted) < .001) were more likely to be vaccine hesitant. Controlling for all demographic variables (age, race, gender, and education), more frequent use of social media for reading news was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy (OR 0.35, 99% CI 0.20, 0.63, p < 0.001).

While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community. Students and educators alike should leverage student-driven education efforts to benefit other learners both within and importantly beyond their institutions.","output":"Learning During and From a Crisis: The Student-Led Development of a COVID-19 Curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing incidence of indoor airborne infections has prompted attention upon the investigation of expiratory droplet dispersion and transport in built environments. In this study, a source (i.e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i.e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0.1 and 10 m, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The droplet dispersion and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the droplet dispersion and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme. For both ventilation schemes, the intake dose will be reduced substantially if the droplets are emitted under the face-to-wall orientation rather than the face-to-face orientation. Implications of using engineering strategies for reducing exposure are briefly discussed.","output":"Numerical modeling of exhaled droplet nuclei dispersion and mixing in indoor environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Information about liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 is scarce.

In this retrospective study, we included all consecutive confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Fuyang Second Peoples Hospital between January 20 and February 25, 2020 and collected clinical characteristics until discharge. The pattern and risk factors of liver dysfunction, viral shedding and outcome were analyzed. Results: . Totally, 146 patients were analyzed. The median age was 44.9 years and 54.1% were men, 43.8% patients presented liver dysfunction (22.6% on admission, 21.2% during hospitalization). The percentage of elevated ALT (15.1% on admission and 24.7% during hospitalization) were significantly higher than ALP (2.1% on admission and 3.4% during hospitalization) ( P < 0.001). Four clinical types were identified, type 1 (persistent normal liver function, 56.2%), type 2 (normal liver function on admission developed to liver dysfunction during hospitalization, 21.2%), type 3 (liver dysfunction on admission restored to normal on discharge, 13.0%) and type 4 (persistent liver dysfunction, 9.6%).

One approach to examining the mechanism responsible for the observed functional T cell suppression is to determine whether virus replication is required for its induction. To this end, mice were inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM that was inactivated with short-wave ultraviolet light, betapropiolactone or psoralen. Mice were also inoculated with live MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic or heterotypic MHV infection. Spleen cells from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with inactivated MHV-JHM yielded extremely variable in vitro proliferative responses after concanavalin A stimulation. MHV-susceptible mice exposed oronasally or intraperitoneally to virus inactivated by any of the minimum effective treatments failed to seroconvert. Immunization with psoralen-treated virus intraperitoneally in Freund's complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge, but survivors had elevated virus-specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to mock-immunized controls at two weeks post-challenge. Spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro T cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection. In contrast, MHV-JHM challenge of mice vaccinated with heterotypic live MHV-S resulted in significantly depressed in vitro T cell function. The combined data suggest that either virus replication or exposure to more concentrated antigen may be required for induction of the dramatic T cell dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of MHV-JHM infection as well as for a detectable MHV-specific humoral response.","output":"Responses of mice to murine coronavirus immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant risk for health care workers.

The magnitude of COVID-19 has undoubtedly affected every aspect of daily life and highlighted the need for increased preparedness, coordination, and monitoring. Amongst all social groups, the elderly is by far the most affected age group in morbidity and mortality [1]. Approximately 1.3 million individuals live in 15,600 nursing home facilities in the United States [2]. In fact, the beginning of COVID-19 may be marked by the 25 deaths in a single King County facility in Washington state. Nursing homes have faced the rapid spread of COVID-19 among residents and staff and have been at the center of the public health emergency during the pandemic. Factors that contribute to this rapid spread include crowding, sharing of bathroom facilities, and gathering in common areas that are not set up for infection control. Nursing homes, in particular, provide ideal environments for devastating infections to spread. Nursing homes, in particular, have essentially been in complete lockdown, not unlike inmates, who both deeply lack social interaction and are currently unable to exist outside the walls of their respective institutions. Those who do not have close family or friends, and rely on the support of voluntary services or social workers, could be at additional risk [6]. To lessen the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, more local authorities are banning visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Furthermore, restrictions on group activities such as playing board games, watching TV in a common space, and engaging in art therapy, may harm residents mental and physical well-being [8]. Nursing home residents are already susceptible to loneliness, and the lack of social interaction due to decreased visitation from family and friends further compounds the traumatization of COVID-19 on daily living. Methods METHODS: This is a descriptive study over a period of 1 month conducted among nursing home staff in Lubbock, TX during the COVID-19 pandemic. Agreeable nursing home staff will have access to a survey (Qualtrics) accessing various aspects relating to the consequences of COVID-19. The survey will be open for a period of 1 month until which the participants will have the opportunity to complete the survey. Data from the surveys will then be collected and analyzed. The survey consists of a self-developed questionnaire along with the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The scale which was originally developed in 1983 by author Sheldon Cohen is one of the most widely used tools to measure the perception of stress. It has been used in studies assessing the stressfulness of situations and is widely available in the public domain [12]. Type of study: Descriptive mixed method triangulation design study Subjects: Healthcare staff with direct patient care Inclusion criteria: 1. Geriatric Nursing home staff in Lubbock, TX 2. Staff agreeable to participate in survey regardless of color, creed, age or sex. 3. Staff in direct contact with patients (Nursing and Physicians) Exclusion criteria: 1. Ancillary staff not involved in direct patient care 2. Staff who refuse to give voluntary consent to participate in survey Design: This will be a descriptive, mixed method triangulation design studyutilizing an online, self-administered survey tool created using Qualtrics platform. An information sheet explaining the research project will be given to the nursing home staff. It will include: participation is completely voluntary, that participation will not affect their employment in anyway, and their employer will not have access to the results. It will also explain that by submitting an anonymous survey they are agreeing to take part in the research study. The survey questions will gauge mental health impact on staff and their perspectives on the impact on patients and their own mental health. The survey will contain a mix of 10 close- and open-ended questions. Results Outcomes: To determine the impact of COVID-19 on nursing home staff mental health and gather information that may be utilized to create measures to better deliver care in nursing homes.Survey will be sent to 40 members with an expected response rate of about 20 percent and possibly higher. Results will be available by March 2020 for further analysis and distribution. Conclusions Ultimately, COVID-19 has taught painful lessons in the difficulties of isolating the elderly. The need for controlling infection may come at a high cost to the mental health and well-being of patients and staff, which is a critical public health issue. We hope that the results of this study will help us better understand the challenges geriatric nursing facilities have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and help us develop better strategies for similar threats in the future.

The authors have investigated a photon-counting spectral imaging system with two energy bins for contrast-enhanced mammography. System optimization and the potential benefit compared to conventional non-energy-resolved absorption imaging was studied. METHODS A framework for system characterization was set up that included quantum and anatomical noise and a theoretical model of the system was benchmarked to phantom measurements. RESULTS Optimal combination of the energy-resolved images corresponded approximately to minimization of the anatomical noise, which is commonly referred to as energy subtraction. In that case, an ideal-observer detectability index could be improved close to 50% compared to absorption imaging in the phantom study. Optimization with respect to the signal-to-quantum-noise ratio, commonly referred to as energy weighting, yielded only a minute improvement. In a simulation of a clinically more realistic case, spectral imaging was predicted to perform approximately 30% better than absorption imaging for an average glandularity breast with an average level of anatomical noise. For dense breast tissue and a high level of anatomical noise, however, a rise in detectability by a factor of 6 was predicted. Another approximately 70%-90% improvement was found to be within reach for an optimized system. CONCLUSIONS Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is feasible and beneficial with the current system, and there is room for additional improvements. Inclusion of anatomical noise is essential for optimizing spectral imaging systems.","output":"Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography with a photon-counting detector."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a personal reflection, as a female academic during Covid-19, on how women's academic productivity seems primarily to be discussed in relation to a different kind of productivity-motherhood.

Minoritized and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have borne a disproportionate burden of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Recently developed FDA-approved vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce severe COVID-19Crelated outcomes. Vaccination campaigns have the potential to advance health equity by prioritizing allocation to those at highest risk while striving for herd immunity. Large integrated health systems have been faced with the daunting task of meeting the rapidly evolving needs of diverse patient populations for the provision of population-based testing, treatment, education, and now vaccine distribution. We have designed a COVID-19 vaccine equity index (CVEI) to guide health system vaccination strategy. Methods: We considered proportion unvaccinated within a health care system. We then used real-time readily available electronic health record (EHR) COVID-19 testing positivity and proportion hospitalized to measure burden of illness by race/ethnicity. We used conditional probability and statistical theory to measure equity for unvaccinated individuals and to derive an index to highlight these inequities for specific subgroups. Results: We present an illustrative hypothetical example using simulated data for which we calculated the CVEI for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic patients. In the example, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients had inequitable outcomes. Conclusion: The index can be widely implemented to promote more equitable outcomes among racial/ethnic groups, reducing morbidity and mortality within the overall population as we pursue the collective goal of herd immunity through mass vaccination.","output":"Measuring and Promoting SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Equity: Development of a COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To identify factors impeding or facilitating Return to Work (RTW) after minor to serious musculoskeletal Road Traffic Injuries (RTI).

However, the accuracy of rapid antigen tests in real-life clinical settings is unclear because adequately designed diagnostic accuracy studies are essentially lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid antigen test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in a primary/ secondary care testing facility. METHODS: Consecutive individuals presented at a COVID-19 testing facility affiliated to a Swiss University Hospital were recruited (n=1465%). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained, and the Roche/ SD Biosensor rapid antigen test was conducted in-parallel with two real-time PCR (reference standard). RESULTS: Among 1465 patients recruited, RT-PCR was positive in 141 individuals, corresponding to a prevalence of prevalence 9.6%. The Roche/ SD Biosensor rapid antigen test was positive in 94 patients (6.4%), and negative in 1368 individuals (93.4%). The overall sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was 65.3% (95% confidence interval, CI, 56.8, 73.1), the specificity was 99.9% (95%CI 99.5, 100.0).

The results show that MGMADS-CNN with three attention layers (MGMADS-3) has achieved accuracy of 96.75% on X-ray images and 98.25% on CT images. The specificity and sensitivity are 98.06% and 96.6% on X-ray images, and 98.17% and 98.05% on CT images. The size of MGMADS-3 model is only 43.6 M bytes. In addition, the detection speed of MGMADS-3 on X-ray images and CT images are 6.09 ms and 4.23 ms for per image, respectively. It is proved that the MGMADS-3 can detect and classify COVID-19 faster with higher accuracy and efficiency.","output":"A multi-scale gated multi-head attention depthwise separable CNN model for recognizing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhizomania of sugar beet is a soilborne disease complex comprised of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) and its plasmodiophorid vector, Polymyxa betae. Although BNYVV is considered the causal agent of rhizomania, additional viruses frequently accompany BNYVV in diseased roots. In an effort to better understand the virus cohort present in sugar beet roots exhibiting rhizomania disease symptoms, five independent RNA samples prepared from diseased beet seedlings reared in a greenhouse or from field-grown adult sugar beet plants and enriched for virus particles were subjected to RNAseq. In all but a healthy control sample, the technique was successful at identifying BNYVV and provided sequence reads of sufficient quantity and overlap to assemble > 98% of the published genome of the virus. Utilizing the derived consensus sequence of BNYVV, infectious RNA was produced from cDNA clones of RNAs 1 and 2. The approach also enabled the detection of beet soilborne mosaic virus (BSBMV), beet soilborne virus (BSBV), beet black scorch virus (BBSV), and beet virus Q (BVQ), with near-complete genome assembly afforded to BSBMV and BBSV. In one field sample, a novel virus sequence of 3682 nt was assembled with significant sequence similarity and open reading frame (ORF) organization to members within the subgenus Alphanecrovirus (genus Necrovirus; family Tombusviridae). Construction of a DNA clone based on this sequence led to the production of the novel RNA genome in vitro that was capable of inducing local lesion formation on leaves of Chenopodium quinoa. Additionally, two previously unreported satellite viruses were revealed in the study; one possessing weak similarity to satellite maize white line mosaic virus and a second possessing moderate similarity to satellite tobacco necrosis virus C. Taken together, the approach provides an efficient pipeline to characterize variation in the BNYVV genome and to document the presence of other viruses potentially associated with disease severity or the ability to overcome resistance genes used for sugar beet rhizomania disease management.","output":"RNAseq Analysis of Rhizomania-Infected Sugar Beet Provides the First Genome Sequence of Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus from the USA and Identifies a Novel Alphanecrovirus and Putative Satellite Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cycloastragenol (CAG) is the active form of astragaloside IV isolated from Astragalus Radix, which displays multiple pharmacological effects. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether CAG protected against ischemic brain injury and, if so, whether the beneficial effects were associated with the regulation of SIRT1 in the ischemic brain. Mice were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. CAG (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion, 12 h later and then twice daily for up to three days. CAG dose-dependently reduced brain infarct volume, significantly ameliorated functional deficits, and prevented neuronal cell loss in MCAO mice. Meanwhile, CAG significantly reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, prevented tight junction degradation and subsequently ameliorated blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, CAG significantly upregulated SIRT1 expression in the ischemic brain but did not directly activate its enzymatic activity. Concomitant with SIRT1 upregulation, CAG reduced p53 acetylation and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in the ischemic brain. CAG also inhibited NF-B p65 nuclear translocation. As a result, CAG suppressed the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF- and IL-1, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ischemic brain. Our findings suggest that CAG is neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury in mice and that its beneficial effect may involve SIRT1 upregulation and the inhibition of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain.","output":"Cycloastragenol upregulates SIRT1 expression, attenuates apoptosis and suppresses neuroinflammation after brain ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate the effects of physical activity before, during, and after social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on low back pain (LBP), mental health and healthcare access.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Turkey on 11 March, 2020, and the peak phase seemed to end by the end of April. All the patients whom were referred, treated, or previously operated but still at the hospital during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemics in the country were included into this retrospective study. Patient's diagnosis, interventions, adverse events, and early post-procedural courses were studied. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with various diagnoses of congenital cardiovascular disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Ages of the patients ranged between 2 days and 16 years. Seventeen cases were males and 14 cases were females. Elective cases were postponed. Priority was given to interventional procedures, and five cases were treated percutaneously. Palliative procedures were preferred in patients whom presumably would require long hospital stay. Corrective procedures were not hesitated in prioritised stable patients. Mortality occurred in one patient. Eight patients out of 151 ICU admissions were diagnosed with COVID-19, and they were transferred to COVID-19 ICU immediately. Three nurses whom also took care of the paediatric cases became infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the children did not catch the disease. CONCLUSION: Mandatory and emergent congenital cardiac percutaneous and surgical procedures may be performed with similar postoperative risks as there are no pandemics with meticulous care and preventive measures.","output":"Congenital cardiac interventions during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemics in the country in a pandemics hospital in Istanbul"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore whether and for how long use of healthcare services is increased among children and adolescents after covid-19.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly percentages of all cause and cause specific healthcare use in primary care (general practitioner, emergency ward) and specialist care (outpatient, inpatient) from six months before to about six months after the week of being tested for SARS-CoV-2, using a difference-in-differences approach. RESULTS: A substantial short term relative increase in primary care use was observed for participants during the first month after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result compared with those who tested negative (age 1-5 years: 339%, 95% confidence interval 308% to 369%; 6-15 years: 471%, 450% to 491%; 16-19 years: 401%, 380% to 422%). Use of primary care for the younger age groups was still increased at two months (1-5 years: 22%, 4% to 40%; 6-15 years: 14%, 2% to 26%) and three months (1-5 years: 26%, 7% to 46%, 6-15 years: 15%, 3% to 28%), but not for the oldest group (16-19 years: 11%, ?2% to 24% and 6%, ?7% to 19%, respectively). Children aged 1-5 years who tested positive also showed a minor long term (6 months) relative increase in primary care use (13%, ?0% to 26%) that was not observed for the older age groups, compared with same aged children who tested negative. Results were similar yet the age differences less pronounced compared with untested controls. For all age groups, the increase in primary care visits was due to respiratory and general or unspecified conditions. No increased use of specialist care was observed. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 among children and adolescents was found to have limited impact on healthcare services in Norway. Preschool aged children might take longer to recover (3-6 months) than primary or secondary school students (1-3 months), usually because of respiratory conditions.","output":"Healthcare use in 700 000 children and adolescents for six months after covid-19: before and after register based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public Health Laboratories provide essential services for underserved populations, testing of environmental and animal samples, and detection of emerging diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection on M. pneumoniae pneumonia in hospitalized children and build a model to predict a severe disease course. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia meeting our protocol who were admitted to Shanghai Childrens Medical Center from December 1, 2016, to May 31, 2019. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis, M. pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors for adenovirus coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection. RESULTS: Among the 107 M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients, the coinfection rate was 56.07%, and 60 (60/107, 56.07%) patients were infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. Adenovirus was the most prevalent coinfecting organism, accounting for 22.43% (24/107). The classification tree confirmed that viral coinfection was more common in patients younger than 3 years old. Adenovirus coinfection and drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection occurred more commonly in patients with refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (P = 0.019; P = 0.001). A prediction model including wheezing, lung consolidation and extrapulmonary complications was used to predict adenovirus coinfection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI 0.679C0.893, P < 0.001). A prolonged fever duration after the application of macrolides for 48 h was found more commonly in patients infected by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae (P = 0.002). A fever duration longer than 7 days was an independent risk factor for drug-resistant Mycoplasma infection (OR = 3.500, 95% CI = 1.310C9.353, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia is associated with adenovirus coinfection and infection by drug-resistant M. pneumoniae. A prediction model combining wheezing, extrapulmonary complications and lung consolidation can be used to predict adenovirus coinfection in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. A prolonged fever duration indicates drug-resistant M. pneumoniae infection, and a reasonable change in antibiotics is necessary.","output":"Impact of viral coinfection and macrolide-resistant mycoplasma infection in children with refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease that is causing significant global morbidity and mortality Understanding the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the host metabolism is still in its infancy but of great importance Herein, we investigated the metabolic response during viral shedding and post-shedding in an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 ferret model (n = 6) challenged with two SARS-CoV-2 isolates Virological and metabolic analyses were performed on (minimally invasive) collected oral swabs, rectal swabs, and nasal washes Fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were only found in the nasal wash samples in four of the six ferrets, and in the samples collected 3 to 9 days post-infection (referred to as viral shedding) Central carbon metabolism metabolites were analyzed during viral shedding and post-shedding periods using a dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (dMRM) database and method Subsequent untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of the same samples were performed using a Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) methodology, building upon the identified differentiated central carbon metabolism metabolites Multivariate analysis of the acquired data identified 29 significant metabolites and three lipids that were subjected to pathway enrichment and impact analysis The presence of viral shedding coincided with the challenge dose administered and significant changes in the citric acid cycle, purine metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathways, amongst others, in the host nasal wash samples An elevated immune response in the host was also observed between the two isolates studied These results support other metabolomic-based findings in clinical observational studies and indicate the utility of metabolomics applied to ferrets for further COVID-19 research that advances early diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild clinical COVID-19 infections, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of new or repurposed drug therapies","output":"Metabolic Profiling from an Asymptomatic Ferret Model of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the multi-states (MuSt) theory as a framework, the present study focused on the individual (personality) antecedents of psychobiosocial states. Psychobiosocial states comprise emotional subjective experiences and their correlates (cognitive, motivational, volitional, bodily, motor-behavioural, operational, and communicative), that can be functional for performance (helpful) or dysfunctional (harmful). Specifically, we examined the relationships between two perfectionism dimensions (perfectionistic strivings and concerns) and functional and dysfunctional psychobiosocial states.

ED crowding affects both the quality and access of health services and is associated with poorer patient outcomes and increased mortality rates. In Ireland the practising of Corridor Medicine and Trolley Crises have become prevalent. The objectives of this study are to describe the demographic and clinical profile of patients attending regional EDs and to investigate the factors influencing ED utilisation in Ireland. METHODS: This was a multi-centre, cross-sectional study and recruitment occurred at a selection of urban and rural EDs (n = 5) in Ireland throughout 2020. At each site all adults presenting over a 24 h census period were eligible for inclusion. Clinical data were collected via electronic records and a questionnaire provided information on demographics, healthcare utilisation, service awareness and factors influencing the decision to attend the ED. RESULTS: Demographics differed significantly between ED sites in terms of age (p  0.05), socioeconomic status (p  0.001), and proximity of health services (p  0.001). Prior to ED attendance 64% of participants accessed community health services. Most participants (70%) believed the ED was the best place for emergency care or attended due to lack of awareness of other services (30%). Musculoskeletal injuries were the most common reason for presentation to the ED in this study (24%) and almost a third of patients (31%) reported presenting to the ED for an x-ray or scan. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified regional and socioeconomic differences in the drivers of ED presentations and factors influencing ED attendance in Ireland from the patient perspective. Improved awareness of, and provision of alternative care pathways could potentially decrease ED attendances, which would be important in the context of reducing ED crowding during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Second, higher SES reduces mental distress during the pandemic, and this protective effect is particularly strong for individuals who contract the virus or who have family members infected with the disease. Mediation analysis further illustrates that SES shapes the risk of infection and mental distress primarily through three channels: access to daily essential and protective supplies, employment status, and the community environment.

The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS: Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows.

Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","output":"Investigating Popular Mental Health Mobile Application Downloads and Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In March this year, most of the routine activities were cancelled during the streaming of the pandemic in Italy. This prompted a pragmatic reorganization of the traditional care model of nursing and medicine, to quickly give an efficient clinical response. During the first phase of the pandemic, outpatient visits dropped by more than 60%, forcefully shifting to telemedicine to assure continuity of care despite the lockdown. Objectives: The aim of the present work was to describe the strategy adopted during and immediately after the lockdown to assure the follow up of patients and the maintenance of their treatment in an outpatient virtual telemedicine clinic dedicated to RDs. Methods: the patient flow to a rheumatology division during the lockdown was evaluated retrospectively from March to September 2020 in accordance with local restrictions, and three periods are described. Results: 653/913 (71.5%), 542/542 (100%) and 1.048/1.048 (100%) infusion activities scheduled were performed at the centre for daily infusion and pre-infusion assessment, respectively during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd period. In the outpatient clinic during the 1st period, 96.96% of the cases was shifted to Telemedicine, which decreased to 52.45% in the 2nd period;while in the 3rd period, 97.6% of the performances were carried out at the clinic. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound, capillaroscopy, and joint injection were generally postponed during the 1st period, reduced drastically during the 2nd and performed regularly during 3rd period. Ulcer treatment and the Clinical Trial Unit never stopped their activity. The flow of the activity of the outpatient clinic and the day hospital is represented as monthly trends in graph 1 (See Graph 1). Conclusion: Our data show the feasibility of Telemedicine in a lockdown condition. Shifting stable patients to Telemedicine has the potentiality to minimize the risk of contagion and allow continuity of care. In the future, the use of Telemedicine for specific clinical uses might assure patient assistance also in non-pandemic conditions.

The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed marked increases in kindness and social connection, but as months passed social tensions re-emerged or grew anew. Thus local authorities faced persistent and evolving challenges. A cross-sectional survey (N = 2,924) examined perceptions of social cohesion while Britain was slowly emerging from its first national lockdown in June 2020 in six English local authorities that have prioritised investment in social cohesion over the last two years (including five 'integration areas') compared with three other areas that have not. We expected that social cohesion programmes would better equip people to tackle the various challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a greater sense of social cohesion in the six local authorities (at the micro, meso and macro levels) than in other areas. This was manifested as higher levels of reported social activism, interpersonal trust and closer personal relationships, greater political trust and more positive attitudes towards immigrants. Findings are consistent with the proposition that investing in social cohesion underpins stronger and more connected and open communities, better able to cope with crisis situations.","output":"The social cohesion investment: Communities that invested in integration programmes are showing greater social cohesion in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the most common cause of disability in adults worldwide. Despite advances in the understanding of stroke pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. In this study, we explored the interaction of Shrm4 and the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABAB ) in ischemic stroke. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced by filament insertion in Shrm4+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Baclofen was administered was used to activate GABAB in vivo during reperfusion. Neurological deficits, motor and memory functions, and infarct volume were determined in the various mouse groups. Furthermore, we also developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model in primary neurons to test Shrm4/GABAB interactions in vitro. Shrm4 was observed to decrease infarct volume and neuronal cell loss in penumbra, and rescue neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Notably, Shrm4 also increased pole climbing speed, reduced foot faults, and increased escape latency in the Morris water maze test, while reducing neuron autophagy through an interaction with GABAB receptors. GABAB activation using baclofen further reduced OGD-induced neuron damage in culture and stroke outcomes of MCAO, relative to Shrm4 alone. Taken together, Shrm4-mediated GABAB activation confers neuroprotection by reducing neuronal autophagy in acute ischemic stroke.","output":"Shrm4 contributes to autophagy inhibition and neuroprotection following ischemic stroke by mediating GABAB receptor activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The three European countries included in the northwest littoral of the Mediterranean region - Italy, France and Spain - reported their first cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus early in 2020. The subsequent epidemic strongly impacted these countries, challenging the healthcare systems efficiency, and the capacity and transparency of their public statistics structures. Because public statistics were not fully adapted to such a new health situation, the available official data could not wholly describe the epidemic correctly. This paper developed an indicator derived from the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 aiming to describe the time and spatial dynamics of the epidemic. Although the analysis was not applied to France due to the lack of data available, the comparative analysis among Spain and Italy highlighted some similarities and certain divergences, partially attributable to the features of each country\`s national demographic patterns and the peculiarities of applied health protocols. Finally, mortality during the first wave of the epidemic has been analysed for the three countries, demonstrating higher mortality index in Spain, although the reported number of SARS-CoV-2 declared deaths does not explain a portion of this mortality excess.","output":"Methodological elements for the comparative analysis of the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic in France, Italy, and Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health problem for 183 out of 197 countries in the world. Understanding the routes and pathogenesis of the coronavirus is important and it is considered that the studies on host cell receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be valuable for the treatment and prevention of the disease. AIM: To evaluate the possibility of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at throat. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted. CONCLUSION: In view of the fact that the mouth and nose have higher number of ACE2 expressed cells, they serve as a gateway for the virus to enter. Thus, blocking the gate could be a good choice to reduce or even prevent the transmission. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are double-stranded RNA molecules and could be designed easily and directed against many strains of a virus. Due to their features, siRNAs can provide a potential strategy to interfere with the replication of viral diseases. We think that since oral and nasal epithelial cells are relatively easily accessible it may allow to develop siRNA molecules to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 already at the entry where it continues to replicate for a period (Fig. 1, Ref. 50).","output":"Potential therapeutic road for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 at throat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect on students from the COVID-19 pandemic, violence related to racism, and loss of customary school routines may cause loss of both school connection and a sense of belonging.

To understand the net effects of SIP policies, we measure the change in excess deaths following the implementation of SIP policies in 43 countries and all U.S. states. We use an event study framework to quantify changes in the number of excess deaths after the implementation of a SIP policy.

At the U.S. state-level, excess mortality increases in the immediate weeks following SIP introduction and then trends below zero following 20 weeks of SIP implementation. We failed to find that countries or U.S. states that implemented SIP policies earlier, and in which SIP policies had longer to operate, had lower excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement SIP policies.

As members of a foundation cohort of these junior doctors we aimed to create a way to quanitfy the wellbeing of ourselves and our colleagues at this challeging time. We aimed to use a combination of numerous tools to monitor foundation doctors in Blackburn during this crisis. This would inform which measures would be best suited to be put in place to protect this cohort from early burnout and poor mental health in the future. Method We designed a survey of 25 questions which we invited our foundation colleagues to fill in anonymously during the first and second waves of the pandemic in response to times when foundation doctors were redeployed to aid the frontline. The survey has been based on the PHQ9, GAD7, Epworth Sleepiness scale, Physician wellbeing index, Medical students wellbeing index, Maslach burnout inventory BMA burnout questionnaire and the QOL scale. Result From a cohort of around 140 foundation doctors we had 46 participants in our trial of this tool;46% had been redeployed and 54% not redeployed. Over 50% of survey respondents reported high stress, poor motivation and depersonalisation over the two weeks at the peak of the pandemic, key early signs of burnout. Lack of interest in their work, poor sleep and anhedonia were increased across both groups (redeployed and non redeployed). The interventions after the first wave data which repondents found beneficial included;financial reassurances during redeployments, protected non clinical areas for rest, a named individual senior staff member for wellbeing support.

This study aimed to compare the surgical and postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal resections with those of open surgery in the octogenarian population. METHODS Retrospective analysis based on a prospectively maintained database of octogenarians who underwent laparoscopic or open elective colorectal resections from 2001 to 2008 was performed. Diagnosis, comorbidities, operative data, and early postoperative complications are analyzed in this report. RESULTS Colon resection was performed for 199 octogenarians, using laparotomy for 116 patients (group 1) and laparoscopic surgery for 83 patients (group 2). The mean age was 84.3 years for the laparotomy patients and 84.7 years for the laparoscopic patients. The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores was comparable between groups 1 and 2. Colorectal adenoma was the most common indication for surgery in both groups: for 77.6% of the group 1 patients and 54.2% of the group 2 patients. Right colectomy was the most frequently performed operation in group 2: for 57.8% of the group 2 patients and 31% of the group 1 patients (p = 0.0003). Open resections had a higher mean blood loss in both group 1 (286 ml) and group 2 (152 ml) (p = 0.0002), and more patients required intraoperative transfusions (p = 0.005) despite similar operative times. The conversion rate in the laparoscopic group was 25.3%. The patients in the laparoscopic group had less morbidity, both overall and clinically, than the open group (p < 0.05). The median hospital stay was 8 days in group 1 and 6 days in group 2 (p = 0.0065). The rate of major surgical complications was similar in the two groups of patients: 6% in group 1 and 4.8% in group 2. The reoperation rate was 2.6% in group 1 and 3.6% in group 2 (p > 0.05). The mortality rate was 3.4% in group 1 and 2.4% in group 2.

Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations' inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs. Hence, there is a need for active involvement by public and private organizations to regulate, mobilize, and expand the digital health sector for the improvement of health care systems in countries.","output":"Current Challenges of Digital Health Interventions in Pakistan: Mixed Methods Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Japan, four medical facilities including our own - the National Center for Global health and Medicine (NCGM) - have been designated for the treatment of specified infectious diseases by the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare.

Data on treatment are scare and parallels have been made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.","output":"Case report study of the first five COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Introduccin El 30 de enero de 2020 la organizacin mundial de la salud (OMS) declar una emergencia internacional por la pandemia causada por un nuevo coronavirus Existen algunas indicaciones oncolgicas que tienen especial prioridad y se siguen realizando estudios a pesar de la situacin actual En estos estudios hemos encontrado hallazgos sospechosos de neumona COVID-19 en pacientes asintomticos El objetivo de este trabajo es valorar la incidencia de estos hallazgos, describir sus caractersticas y valorar la evolucin de los pacientes sospechosos Material y mtodos Se han revisado los estudios PET oncolgicos realizados entre el 18 de marzo y el 8 de abril de 2020 Se han identificado los pacientes que presentaban hallazgos sugerentes de corresponder con un proceso infeccioso pulmonar de forma incidental en pacientes asintomticos Se han revisado las historias clnicas de estos pacientes para confirmar o descartar la infeccin por SARS-CoV2 Resultados Durante el periodo especificado se realizaron un total de 129 estudios PET-TC con indicacin oncolgica De ellos, en 11 (8,5%) se encontraron hallazgos sospechosos de proceso infeccioso pulmonar Se trataba de 8 varones y 3 mujeres con edades comprendidas entre los 30 y los 79 a?os (media 62,2) Conclusiones Los pacientes con COVID 19 pueden presentar escasos sntomas de la enfermedad, y en los estudios PET-TC se pueden detectar tanto pacientes presintomticos como pacientes casi asintomticos por lo que los mdicos nucleares deben prestar especial atencin en la valoracin pulmonar de los estudios PET-TC Introduction On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the pandemic caused by a new coronavirus There are some oncological indications that have special priority and studies are still being carried out despite the current situation In these studies we have found suspicious findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients Material and methods Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection Results During the specified period, a total of 129 PET-CT studies were performed Of these, 11 (8 5%) found suspicious findings of a pulmonary infectious process These were 8 men and 3 women aged between 30 and 79 years (mean 62 2) Conclusions Patients with COVID 19 can present few symptoms of the disease, and in PET-CT studies both presymptomatic and almost asymptomatic patients can be detected, so nuclear medicine physicians should take special attention to the pulmonary evaluation of PET-CT studies","output":"Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in asymptomatic patients after an oncological PET/CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of single-vision spectacle use on myopia progression in children with low myopia. METHODS: MYOSOTIS is a prospective myopia screening survey including all 46 primary and junior high schools in two districts of Hangzhou, China. After 1-to-1 propensity score matching (PSM), 1,685 pairs of students with low myopia were included. Group 1 was composed of 1,685 non-spectacle users at baseline, and group 2 consisted of 1,685 spectacle wearers at both survey rounds. Refraction was examined by noncycloplegic autorefraction and mean spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of both eyes was analyzed. Myopia progression was measured by average rate of change in SER (r?SER) between two survey rounds and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: After PSM, no significant difference in age, sex ratio, SER, and uncorrected visual acuity (VA) between the two groups was found at baseline. For myopic progression, r?SER showed no significant difference between the two groups (? 0.67  0.97 versus ? 0.69  0.81 diopter/year, P = 0.448). After adjusting for age, sex, SER, and VA, the difference in r?SER between the two groups was not significant (? 0.031, 95% CI ? 0.089 ~ 0.028 diopter/year, P = 0.302). In the subgroup analyses stratified by age and SER, and in the sensitivity analyses by eye side, there was still no significant difference in myopia progression between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that single-vision spectacle use has no impact on myopia progression in children with low myopia. Spectacles are recommended in children with low myopia if their visual acuity has interfered with the daily life.

Halting all pituitary surgery services was not feasible particularly if patients present with acute or progressive visual loss due to the mass effect of the pituitary lesion, pituitary apoplexy, or lesions with aggressive features. METHOD: An 11-point telephone questionnaire was used to evaluate the service provided between March and September 2020. On a 1-10 scale, patients scored their feelings about remote clinics, the support offered, the clarity of explanations, quality of interaction with their surgeon, and an overall assessment of remote clinics. RESULTS: 20 of the 21 patients who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary lesion resection between the 02/03/2020 and 14/09/2020 participated in the survey. They unanimously felt the introduction of remote consultations was necessary and felt safer. Their surgeons communication skills helped their experience the most. It allowed for easier attendances as they did not rely on family or long travelling times. Drawbacks involved the lack of face-to-face interaction particularly pre-operatively, as patients felt they missed the human factor, seeing their scans, and meeting their surgeon in person. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has affected people from a biopsychosocial perspective leaving long-lasting effects on the economy and healthcare systems of the world. This service evaluation highlights a positive outcome in terms of patient experience. Moving forward, incorporating remote services as an option for follow-up cases would be welcomed by most patients in the survey.","output":"426 An Evaluation of The Service of Endoscopic Trans-Sphenoidal Surgery for Excision of Pituitary Lesion During The SARS-Cov-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the shadow of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the sterilization has become a major necessity for humans to avoid exponential Infection.

Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking.

courses such as restorative dentistry As a solution to help dental schools adapt to the pandemic, we have developed a compact and portable teaching-learning platform called DenTeach This platform is intended for remote teaching and learning pertaining to dental schools at these unprecedented times This device can facilitate fully remote and physical-distancing-aware teaching and learning in dentistry DenTeach platform consists of an instructor workstation (DT-Performer), a student workstation (DT-Student), advanced wireless networking technology, and cloud-based data storage and retrieval The platform procedurally synchronizes the instructor and the student with real-time video, audio, feel, and posture (VAFP) To provide quantitative feedback to instructors and students, the DT-Student workstation quantifies key performance indices (KPIs) related to a given task to assess and improve various aspects of the dental skills of the students DenTeach has been developed for use in teaching, shadowing, and practice modes In the teaching mode, the device provides each student with tactile feedback by processing the data measured and/or obtained from the instructor's workstation, which helps the student enhance their dental skills while inherently learning from the instructor In the shadowing mode, the student can download the augmented videos and start watching, feeling, and repeating the tasks before entering the practice mode In the practice mode, students use the system to perform dental tasks and have their dental performance skills automatically evaluated in terms of KPIs such that both the student and the instructor are able to monitor student's work Most importantly, as DenTeach is packaged in a small portable suitcase, it can be used anywhere by connecting to the cloud-based data storage network to retrieve procedures and performance metrics This paper also discusses the feasibility of the DenTeach device in the form of a case

media play an important role in the dissemination of information on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is important to measure whether the population is receiving information that calms it down, as well as whether such news are in accordance with the magnitude of the issue. Objective: To validate a questionnaire that measures the perception of the media and their informative role in the face of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A validation process for a questionnaire that measures the perception of the magnitude of this issue and whether it generates fear was carried out. The validation was performed by means of a literature search. Moreover, a first version of the scale was developed, which was assessed by 30 experts (physicians, epidemiologists, among others). After this, an exploratory factor analysis and descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Our scale had 13 initial items; however, one of them was eliminated because of its unsatisfactory level of statistical adequacy. Exploratory factorial analysis and parallel analysis suggested three factors. Results of the KMO coefficient (0.833) and the Bartletts test of sphericity (4998.5; gl = 66; p&lt;0.001) were acceptable and significant, which justify the exploratory factorial analysis.

To address this issue, many schools have instituted residency preparation courses (sometimes referred to as boot camps) particularly for students entering surgical fields. Courses for students entering nonprocedural fields are less common and most assess increases in self-reported confidence without providing objective evidence of a gain in knowledge or skills improvement. Materials and Methods We used a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) model to develop and pilot cycle 1 of a nonprocedural internship preparation elective in 2019. Feedback was used to refine the course and map sessions to core competencies outlined by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for PDSA cycle 2. The curriculum was adapted for remote synchronous delivery due to the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020 using a combination of didactic lectures containing embedded polls and case-based role play responses using a chat box. Students completed anonymous surveys assessing self-perceived levels of confidence, as well as an objective comprehensive assessment after course completion. Results A total of 89 students participated in the course. Pre-session confidence was lowest for transfusion medicine, handling pages from nursing while on call, and knowledge of the role of a chief resident. A statistically significant increase in median scores for self-reported knowledge or confidence was seen in all sessions. The percentage of students reporting that they were either confident or extremely confident also increased significantly after each session (p<0.001 for all). All sessions analyzed were rated as useful or extremely useful by more than half of the students, and 94% of the students scored 70% or higher on the comprehensive course assessment.

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status.

This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. Subject and methods: For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. Results: We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 25 severe/critical cases and 58 ordinary cases were enrolled. The chest CT images and clinical data of them were reviewed and compared. The risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with the ordinary patients, the severe/critical patients had older ages, higher incidence of comorbidities, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea. The incidences of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and bronchial wall thickening in severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients. Besides, severe/critical patients showed higher incidences of lymph node enlargement, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion than the ordinary patients. The CT scores of severe/critical patients were significantly higher than those of the ordinary patients (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CT score were 80.0% and 82.8%, respectively, for the discrimination of the 2 types. The clinical factors of age older than 50 years, comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, expectoration, decreased lymphocytes, and increased inflammation indicators were risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Computed tomography findings of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, high CT scores, and extrapulmonary lesions were features of severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

The aim of our study was to analyze incidence and outcomes of AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our study prospectively followed about 198 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), Al Adan Hospital, Kuwait, for developing AKI and outcomes. Age, gender, nationality, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were analyzed. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, inotropes, and medications was recorded. Causes of AKI, indication of dialysis, dialysis modality, dialysis outcomes, and mortality were analyzed. Our study reported that61 out of 198 (30.8%) ICU patients positive for COVID-19, developed AKI according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition of AKI. Forty-eight out of 61 (79%) patients need continuous renal replacement therapy using continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Thirty-seven (61%) out of 61 patients were with severe sepsis syndrome. The most common cause of AKI was sepsis, cytokine storm, hypovolemia, heart failure, MV, and nephrotoxic drugs. Twenty-four patients (39%) out of 61 patients died, and the most common cause of death was sepsis, cytokine storm with respiratory failure, heart failure, and AKI. The outcome of AKI was as follows: six patients (10%) had complete recovery, five patients had partial recovery (8%), and 26 (43%) patients became dialysis dependent. Incidence of AKI is high in ICU COVID-19 patients and is associated with poor outcomes and high mortality. Early detection and specific therapy of kidney changes, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, may help to improve critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Incidence and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this new normal era, many activities began to operate again such as offices malls etc. This creates a potential mass crowd.

This study tested a tool that included image processing and artificial intelligence to help implement health protocols as recommended by the government. This tool connects Raspberry PI Thermal Camera (amg8833) Pi Camera an ultrasonic sensor with Multiple Linear Regression and Deep Learning algorithms. The purpose of this tool is to detect body temperature and detect the use of masks. The system will check on the pi camera frame whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The system is trained using the Deep Learning method to detect the use of masks. The system will check the temperature of the human body and the distance between humans and the tool. Temperature and distance data are entered in multiple linear regression formulas to get more accurate results.

As a planning technique for distancing is proposed the formation of a system of space 'soft borders' using flexible, inclined, semi-cylindrical and 'flowing' translucent partitions. The second, 'environmental approach', is based on changing the scheme of communication and environmental situations in the internal environment of the maternity hospital due to the thoughtful arrangement of furniture and interior equipment, as well as due to light, colour and graphic navigation.

Methods An audit was conducted with routinely collected health data before both elective and non-elective surgery at two large Melbourne hospitals during April and early May 2020. We looked for documented systematic screening for COVID-19 disease and fever (>38C) and results of SARS-COV-2 testing, and proposed a minimum acceptable documenting rate of 85%. Results The study included 2197 consecutive patients (1279 (58%) undergoing elective surgery, 917 (42%) undergoing non-elective surgery) across most specialities. Although 926 (72%) patients undergoing elective surgery had both systematic screening and temperature documented, approximately half that percentage undergoing non-elective surgery (n=347; 38%) had both documented. However, 871 (95%) of non-elective surgery patients had temperature documented. Acknowledging limited screening, 85 (9.3%) non-elective surgery patients had positive screening, compared with 39 (3.0%) elective surgery patients. All 152 (7%) patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and no cases were reported from external contact tracing. Conclusions Although 'not documented' does not necessarily equal 'not done', we found that documenting of COVID-19 screening could be improved. Better understanding of implementing screening practices in pandemics and other crises, particularly for non-elective surgery patients, is warranted. What is known about the topic? Little is known about routine screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical patients. However, it is well established that implementing effective uptake of safety and quality initiatives can be difficult. What does this paper add? We found that although most patients had documented temperature, fewer than 75% had a documented systematic questionnaire screen for COVID, particularly patients undergoing non-elective surgery. What are the implications for practitioners? Clear documenting is important in managing patients. Pandemics and other crises can require rapid changes in practice. Implementing such measures may be less complete than anticipated and may require greater use of evidence-based implementation strategies, particularly in the less predictable care of non-elective surgery patients.","output":"Documenting COVID-19 screening before surgery during lockdown (COVID Screen): an audit with routinely collected health data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, nighttime lights have become a widely used proxy for measuring economic activity. This paper examines the potential for high frequency nighttime lights data to provide near real-time tracking of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in Morocco. At the national level, there exists a statistically significant correlation between quarterly movements in Morocco's overall nighttime light intensity and movements in its real GDP. This finding supports the cautious use of lights data to track the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis at higher temporal frequencies and at the subnational and city levels, for which GDP data are unavailable. Relative to its pre-COVID-19 trend growth path of lights, Morocco experienced a large drop in the overall intensity of its lights in March 2020 following the country's first COVID-19 case and the introduction of strict lockdown measures, from which it has subsequently struggled to recover. At the subnational and city levels, while all regions and cities examined shared in March's national decline in nighttime light intensity, some suffered much larger declines than others. Since then, the relative effects of the COVID-19 shock across regions and cities appear to have largely persisted. Notwithstanding these findings, however, further research is required to ascertain the exact causes of the observed changes in light intensity and to fully verify that the results are driven by anthropogenic causes.","output":"Tracking economic activity in response to the COVID-19 crisis using nighttime lights C The case of Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: New records of alien land planarians are regularly reported worldwide, and some correspond to undescribed species of unknown geographic origin. The description of new species of land planarians (Geoplanidae) should classically be based on both external morphology and histology of anatomical structures, especially the copulatory organs, ideally with the addition of molecular data. METHODS: Here, we describe the morphology and reproductive anatomy of a species previously reported as Diversibipalium black, and the morphology of a species previously reported as Diversibipalium blue. Based on next generation sequencing, we obtained the complete mitogenome of five species of Bipaliinae, including these two species. RESULTS: The new species Humbertium covidum n. sp. (syn: Diversibipalium black of Justine et al., 2018) is formally described on the basis of morphology, histology and mitogenome, and is assigned to Humbertium on the basis of its reproductive anatomy. The type-locality is Casier, Italy, and other localities are in the Department of Pyrnes-Atlantiques, France; some published or unpublished records suggest that this species might also be present in Russia, China, and Japan. The mitogenomic polymorphism of two geographically distinct specimens (Italy vs France) is described; the cox1 gene displayed 2.25% difference. The new species Diversibipalium mayottensis n. sp. (syn: Diversibipalium blue of Justine et al., 2018) is formally described on the basis of external morphology and complete mitogenome and is assigned to Diversibipalium on the basis of an absence of information on its reproductive anatomy. The type- and only known locality is the island of Mayotte in the Mozambique Channel off Africa. Phylogenies of bipaliine geoplanids were constructed on the basis of SSU, LSU, mitochondrial proteins and concatenated sequences of cox1, SSU and LSU. In all four phylogenies, D. mayottensis was the sister-group to all the other bipaliines. With the exception of D. multilineatum which could not be circularised, the complete mitogenomes of B. kewense, B. vagum, B. adventitium, H. covidum and D. mayottensis were colinear. The 16S gene in all bipaliine species was problematic because usual tools were unable to locate its exact position. CONCLUSION: Next generation sequencing, which can provide complete mitochondrial genomes as well as traditionally used genes such as SSU, LSU and cox1, is a powerful tool for delineating and describing species of Bipaliinae when the reproductive structure cannot be studied, which is sometimes the case of asexually reproducing invasive species. The unexpected position of the new species D. mayottensis as sister-group to all other Bipaliinae in all phylogenetic analyses suggests that the species could belong to a new genus, yet to be described.","output":"Hammerhead flatworms (Platyhelminthes, Geoplanidae, Bipaliinae): mitochondrial genomes and description of two new species from France, Italy, and Mayotte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity is the prime modality for the prevention of numerous non-communicable diseases and has also been advocated for resilience against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. However, there is currently no systematic and quantitative evidence synthesis of the association between physical activity and the strength of the immune system. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between habitual physical activity and (1) the risk of community-acquired infectious disease, (2) laboratory-assessed immune parameters, and (3) immune response to vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus) up to April 2020 for randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies were included if they compared groups of adults with different levels of physical activity and reported immune system cell count, the concentration of antibody, risk of clinically diagnosed infections, risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to infectious disease. Studies involving elite athletes were excluded. The quality of the selected studies was critically examined following the Cochrane guidelines using ROB2 and ROBINS_E. Data were pooled using an inverse variance random-effects model. RESULTS: Higher level of habitual physical activity is associated with a 31% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.78, 6 studies, N = 557,487 individuals) of community-acquired infectious disease and 37% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.59-0.70, 4 studies, N = 422,813 individuals) of infectious disease mortality. Physical activity interventions resulted in increased CD4 cell counts (32 cells/L, 95% CI 7-56 cells/L, 24 studies, N = 1112 individuals) and salivary immunoglobulin IgA concentration (standardised mean difference 0.756, 95% CI 0.146-1.365, 7 studies, N = 435 individuals) and decreased neutrophil counts (704 cells/L, 95% CI 68-1340, 6 studies, N = 704 individuals) compared to controls. Antibody concentration after vaccination is higher with an adjunct physical activity programme (standardised mean difference 0.142, 95% CI 0.021-0.262, 6 studies, N = 497 individuals). CONCLUSION: Regular, moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with reduced risk of community-acquired infectious diseases and infectious disease mortality, enhances the first line of defence of the immune system, and increases the potency of vaccination.

Although the sense-mRNA architectures of SARS-CoV-2 were reported, its negative strand was unexplored. Here, we deeply sequenced both strands of RNA and found SARS-CoV-2 transcription is strongly biased to form the sense strand.

Framing and discourse analyses are used in the examination of news stories. The key to this study is how the coverage and re/presentation evolved as 'new facts' about the virus emerged. From being re/presented in a distanciated form to becoming a localised scare, the travelling of the virus in space and time and its profile in the newspapers are examined. When the virus began to enjoy widespread coverage, news stories focused on virus incidence and later started paying attention to the internal evolution of the virus and how the government was responding to it. The analysis shows that political indexing sustained the coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to political and official indexing, media coverage largely reproduced the views of those in power, especially the construction of lockdown regulations as rational and legitimate. The government and security officials characterised the coronavirus as an invading enemy that could only be defeated through 'war'. The news media reproduced the war language of the government and security officials, and thus legitimised the lockdowns and security surveillance. In addition to regulatory interventions, the results reveal that the government and civil society initiated prayer and fasting sessions as part of response interventions. This paper concludes that health journalism pays less attention to health scares that are seen to be happening 'elsewhere'. However, once the problems become local, the news value of proximity enables journalists to provide extensive coverage. In addition, the coverage of pandemics begins with increased coverage and panic, followed by constant attention and after some time, the stories leave front pages as journalism fatigue kicks in.","output":"Newspapers' coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Eswatini: from distanciated re/presentations to socio-health panics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of COVID-19 is normally based on the qualitative detection of viral nucleic acid sequences.

Adding to that, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected migrant households worldwide, rendering migrant integration an urgent matter for national governments. Discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and radicalization are all societal threats emerging in periods of massive migrant flows and need appropriate policy measures to be employed in migrant host countries to tackle them. This paper suggests the integration of a multiple criteria decision analysis method, namely PROMETHEE, for policy making with regard to migrant social exclusion. In light of previous research findings and the recent release of the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020, the authors argue that the method proposed could help policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented policies, spot the discrepancies between policies and policy outcomes, and motivate knowledge sharing among the EU member states. The findings include a ten-year comparative list of the EU member states (2010C2019) driven by social inclusion indicators for the foreign-born (non-EU-born) population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 66 melanoma patients, examined with contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT before scheduled metastasectomy without any prior systemic therapy, were included in this single-centre retrospective analysis under IRB waiver. The largest, resected metastasis in each patient was assessed with CT texture analysis and semiquantitative 18F-FDG PET parameters. Correlation between imaging parameters and histopathological mutations (BRAF- and NRAS- genes) were calculated. RESULTS Attenuation standard deviation (SD) within target lesion indicated a weak correlation with its SUVpeak (rho -0.292, p 0.017). However, no correlation between CT texture analysis, metabolic 18F-FDG PET parameters and tumour cell mutation could be established. CONCLUSION CT texture parameters cannot replace the diagnostic value of 18F- FDG PET/CT for metabolic information in melanoma patients.

However, barriers that preclude the implementation of technology driven programs for the assessment and intervention of adults at risk of cognitive decline need to be better understood. This study investigated these outstanding issues, as well as considering the impact that the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic has had on such barriers. METHODS: A sample of 105 participants completed an online survey. Their ages ranged from 18 to 92 years. Of these, 72% were female, 83% had higher education and beyond, 42% were working, 42% were retired, and 14% were unemployed. The questionnaires assessed IT experience alongside awareness, attitudes, and stigmas regarding the use of technologies, particularly those used to support cognitive and mental health. Questionnaires also explored the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on these technology\\\\related factors. We compared these across groups of young (n=45), middle age (n=12) and older adults (n=48). RESULTS: Relative to younger participants, older participants were less aware of, and held stronger stigmas against healthcare technologies, even though they reported more IT experience. IT awareness was associated to more positive (r=0.619, p<0.001) and less negative IT Attitudes (r=\\\\0.271, p=0.015), more acceptability (r=\\\\0.374, p=0.001) and receptiveness towards technologies (r=\\\\0.610, p<0.001). Male participants appeared to be more aware of such technologies than female participants. However, relative to men, women had increased the number of ways and frequency with which they used technologies since the COVID\\\\19 pandemic started, and older people in general felt more inclined to endorse the need to learn more about healthcare technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Having more accumulated IT experience throughout our lives may not necessarily lead to better acceptance of healthcare technologies. More awareness about such specific technologies will help overcome stigmas, and challenging environments such as those imposed by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic may lead to positive changes in perception and acceptance of such technologies. These are necessary steps towards the personalisation of healthcare technologies to support vulnerable adults at risk of dementia.","output":"Factors influencing acceptance of technology across age: Amid the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PTH-6 Frigure 1Home breath tests[Figure omitted.

The study could be helpful in identifying where more public education about COVID-19 is needed. METHOD: This cross-sectional, online descriptive questionnaire-based study was conducted in February and March 2020. A total of 485 participants from Arabic-speaking countries (Jordan, United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Palestine, and Egypt) were asked to complete this Arabic-translated survey using social media platforms (Facebook and WhatsApp).

Bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 can further complicate the disease course and are associated with increased mortality. However, there is limited understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and hypercytokinemia impede the innate immune function against bacterial superinfections. We assessed the influence of COVID-19 plasma hypercytokinemia on the functional responses of myeloid immune cells upon bacterial challenges from acute-phase COVID-19 patients and their corresponding recovery-phase. We show that a severe hypercytokinemia status in COVID-19 patients correlates with the development of bacterial superinfections. Neutrophils and monocytes derived from COVID-19 patients in their acute-phase showed an impaired intracellular microbicidal capacity upon bacterial challenges. The impaired microbicidal capacity was reflected by abrogated MPO and reduced NETs production in neutrophils along with reduced ROS production in both neutrophils and monocytes. Moreover, we observed a distinct pattern of cell surface receptor expression on both neutrophils and monocytes, in line with suppressed autocrine and paracrine cytokine signaling. This phenotype was characterized by a high expression of CD66b, CXCR4 and low expression of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD15 in neutrophils and low expression of HLA-DR, CD86 and high expression of CD163 and CD11b in monocytes. Furthermore, the impaired antibacterial effector function was mediated by synergistic effect of the cytokines TNF-, IFN- and IL-4. COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone showed a significant reduction of overall inflammatory markers in the plasma as well as exhibited an enhanced immune response towards bacterial challenge ex vivo. Finally, broad anti-inflammatory treatment was associated with a reduction in CRP, IL-6 levels as well as length of ICU stay and ventilation-days in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our data provides insights into the transient functional dysregulation of myeloid immune cells against subsequent bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and describe a beneficial role for the use of dexamethasone in these patients.","output":"Hyperinflammatory environment drives dysfunctional myeloid cell effector response to bacterial challenge in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The focus of the study is to assess the advantages and shortcomings of China's public health system in the process of the COVID-19 prevention and to discuss the future reform of China's public health system.

Nine states in India including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Bihar have declared mucormycosis as an epidemic. There are five types of mucormycosis C rhino-orbital-cerebral, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and disseminated. Out of these, rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary mucormycoses are most common in post-COVID patients. The clinical presentation of such patients include cough, fever, breathlessness, chest pain, sinusitis, pain on one side of the face with lack of sensation and proptosis of eye. Diagnosis could be done through analysis of clinical findings, direct microscopy, serum antigen tests, culture, histopathology, radio imaging, and polymerase chain reaction/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Treatment will include preventive measures taken at home or at hospital for post-COVID patients. Medical treatment of mucormycosis mainly includes installing a central catheter (line), maintaining adequate systemic hydration, and infusion of normal intravenous saline before antifungal amphotericin B infusion. Since amphotericin is nephrotoxic, alternative drugs, such as posaconazole or isavuconazole, can be suggested. Adjuvant therapy with caspofungin, deferasirox, statins, aspirin, and hyperbaric oxygen may have to be considered as well.

PURPOSE: To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patients ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31C45 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II. CONCLUSION: For patients aged 21C50 years with coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to the emergency department, a chest radiograph severity score was predictive of risk for hospital admission and intubation. ?

We evaluated the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in prepandemic sample cohorts across five sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Methods: Specificity of the immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual serum and/or plasma samples from blood donors or routine diagnostic testing. All samples were collected before September 2019 and therefore presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cohorts included samples from blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric patients. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Overall specificities for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 9575 samples from blood donors (n = 6714) and diagnostic specimens (n = 2861) were 99.82% (95% CI 99.69-99.91) and 99.93% (95% CI 99.75-99.99), respectively.

Understanding ICU resource needs remains an essential component of meeting current and projected needs of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients. OBJECTIVES: This study queried U.S. ICU clinician perspectives on challenging aspects of care in managing coronavirus disease 2019 patients, current and anticipated resource demands, and personal stress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a descriptive survey methodology, an anonymous web-based survey was administered from April 7, 2020, to April 22, 2020 (email and newsletter) to query members of U.S. national critical care organizations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Through a 16-item descriptive questionnaire, ICU clinician perceptions were assessed regarding current and emerging critical ICU needs in managing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infected patients, resource levels, concerns about being exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and perceived level of personal stress. A total of 9,120 ICU clinicians responded to the survey, representing all 50 U.S. states, with 4,106 (56.9%) working in states with 20,000 or more coronavirus disease 2019 cases. The 7,317 respondents who indicated their profession included ICU nurses (n = 6,731, 91.3%), advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants; n = 334, 4.5%), physicians (n = 212, 2.9%), respiratory therapists (n = 31, 0.4%), and pharmacists (n = 30, 0.4%). A majority (n = 6,510, 88%) reported having cared for a patient with presumed or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. The most critical ICU needs identified were personal protective equipment, specifically N95 respirator availability, and ICU staffing. Minimizing healthcare worker virus exposure during care was believed to be the most challenging aspect of coronavirus disease 2019 patient care (n = 2,323, 30.9%). Nurses report a high level of concern about exposing family members to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median score of 10 on 0C10 scale). Similarly, the level of concern reached the maximum score of 10 in ICU clinicians who had provided care to coronavirus disease 2019 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This national ICU clinician survey identifies continued concerns regarding personal protective equipment supplies with the chief issue being N95 respirator availability. As the pandemic continues, ICU clinicians anticipate a number of limited resources that may impact ICU care including personnel, capacity, and surge potential, as well as staff and subsequent family members exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. These persistent concerns greatly magnify personal stress, offering a therapeutic target for professional organization and facility intervention efforts.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Measures: Reports From a National Survey of 9,120 ICU Clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unhealthy eating habits increase the risk of obesity.

Our initial data analyses reveal that the SIRD model - susceptiple (S), infected (I), recovered (R), and death (D) - is not consistent with the data. In particular, the transition times expressed in the dataset do not obey exponential distributions, implying that there exist unmodeled (hidden) states. We make use of the available epidemiological data to inform the location of these hidden states, allowing us to develop an augmented compartmental model which includes states for hospitalization (H) and end of infectious viral shedding (V).

We undertook surveillance throughout 2016 in coastal Kenya, recruiting individuals presenting with acute respiratory illness at nine outpatient health facilities (any age) or admitted to the Kilifi County Hospital (<5 years old). Whole genomes were sequenced for a selected 111 positives; 94 (84.7%) of B/Victoria lineage and 17 (15.3%) of B/Yamagata lineage. Inter-lineage reassortment was detected in ten viruses; nine with B/Yamagata backbone but B/Victoria NA and NP segments and one with a B/Victoria backbone but B/Yamagata PB2, PB1, PA, and MP segments. Five phylogenomic clusters were identified among the sequenced viruses; (i), pure B/Victoria clade 1A (n = 93, 83.8%), (ii), reassortant B/Victoria clade 1A (n = 1, 0.9%), (iii), pure B/Yamagata clade 2 (n = 2, 1.8%), (iv), pure B/Yamagata clade 3 (n = 6, 5.4%), and (v), reassortant B/Yamagata clade 3 (n = 9, 8.1%).

Local viruses, including the reassortant B/Yamagata strains, clustered closely with viruses from neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda. Our study demonstrated that genomic analysis provides a clearer picture of locally circulating IBV diversity. The high number of IBV introductions highlights the challenge in controlling local influenza epidemics by targeted approaches, for example, sub-population vaccination or patient quarantine.

Although coal and oil have been vital to the development of modern civilization, it is now recognized that atmospheric CO(2) levels must be reduced to avoid the serious effects of climate change, including natural disasters. Consequently, there is currently significant interest in developing suitable methods for the fixation of CO(2) in the air and in exhaust gases. The present work demonstrates a simple yet innovative approach to the chemical fixation of extremely low and very high CO(2) concentrations in air, such as might result from industrial sources. This process is based on the use of aqueous solutions of the water-soluble compounds NaOH and CaCl(2), which react with CO(2) to produce the harmless solids CaCO(3) (limestone) and NaCl (salt) via intermediates such as NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3). The NaCl generated in this process can be converted back to NaOH via electrolysis, during which H(2) (which can be used as a clean energy source) and Cl(2) are produced simultaneously. Additionally, sea water contains both NaCl and CaCl(2) and so could provide a ready supply of these two compounds.

The current study aimed to analyze global research activity on mathematical modeling of transmission and control of several infectious diseases with a known history of serious outbreaks. METHODS: Relevant publications were retrieved using a comprehensive validated search query. The database used was SciVerse Scopus. Indicators related to evolution, growth of publications, infectious diseases encountered, key players, citations, and international research collaboration were presented. RESULTS: The search strategy found 5606. The growth of publications started in 1967 and showed a sharp rise in 2020 and 2021. The retrieved articles received relatively high citations (h-index = 158). Despite being multidisciplinary, Plos One journal made the highest contribution to the field. The main findings of the study are summarized as follows: (a) COVID-19 had a strong impact on the number of publications in the field, specifically during the years 2020 and 2021; (b) research in the field was published in a wide range of journals, mainly those in the field of infectious diseases and mathematical sciences; (c) research in the field was mainly published by scholars in the United States and the United Kingdom; (d) international research collaboration between active countries and less developed countries was poor; (e) research activity relied on research groups with a large number of researchers per group indicative of good author-author collaboration; (f) HIV/AIDS, coronavirus disease, influenza, and malaria were the most frequently researched diseases; (g) recently published articles on COVID-19 received the highest number of citations; and (h) researchers in the Eastern Mediterranian and South-East Asian regions made the least contribution to the retrieved articles.

During the first wave of the pandemic, and in common with other departments, almost all our patient consultations happened over the phone. As the rate of infection fell, we felt it was crucial that the patient voice was heard as we re-organised clinical areas and re-opened services. In view of this, we conducted an online survey to better understand patient concerns around visiting our hospital for appointments and how we can adapt the way we work to ensure patient safety and satisfaction. Methods Using our electronic patient record, we identified patients from the clinic lists of 2 adult rheumatology consultants over a 6-week period between June and August 2020. This timeframe was selected as it was towards the end of the UK nationwide shielding period and our department was returning to deliver an increasing proportion of outpatient care face-to-face. Included patients had to have been treated with an immunosuppressive drug and only those on monotherapy hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine or prednisolone under 5mg were excluded. We consented each patient via telephone before sending them an email link to an online anonymised survey. This included a combination of 9 multiple choice and white space questions. Results 65 patients were identified of which 16 were excluded as we were unable to contact them or they declined consent. 49 patients were sent the survey of which 31 responses were received. 21/31 (67%) of patients had been shielding. The survey revealed six themes of concern. These include: lack of social distancing in common hospital areas, lack of personal protective equipment compliance amongst staff, prolonged time spent in waiting rooms, lack of knowledge on new hospital policies, logistics of using public transport to come to the hospital, and the importance of retaining virtual consultations going forward. 55% of patients stated they would feel safe in returning to the hospital for face-to-face appointments over the next few months. Conclusion Important themes have emerged from this project that we have presented to our rheumatology multi-disciplinary team, Director of Innovation and Head of Patient Experience. This has reinforced adaptations in our hospital environment such as installing safe distance seating in waiting rooms and scheduled phlebotomy slots. Further, where possible we call patients before face-to-face appointments to inform them of our safety measures and try to schedule these patients for outside peak travel hours. We acknowledge that using an online survey may limit responses from older individuals or those with English as a second language. Despite this, our project has shown the importance of recognising the unique concerns of rheumatology patients and the value in using their opinions to create a new normal for our outpatient environment.

Over the past few years, research work has looked into factors that may lead to super-spreading events, clinical/laboratory parameters that may differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia, the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome, reservoir host distribution and transmission routes. A better understanding of these issues may help prevent and control future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS Bats are natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. The human and civet isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome has the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission. When evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low absolute neutrophil count on presentation, along with poor responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment, may raise the index of suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome. SUMMARY The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats raises the possible role of bats in previous and potentially future severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in human.

The existence of an adequate level of digital literacy and e-Health literacy can help society to deal with that problem. Digital and e-Health literacy enables society to search for information efficiently, while remaining critical and open-minded, and use the newly adopted knowledge to improve our mental health. The aim of the paper was to present the frequency of news searches and trusting the COVID-19 related information in the group of medical professionals in Croatia. The survey was conducted using an online questionnaire, containing psychological questionnaires and relevant questions about everyday functioning. Based on the results that show a significant correlation between the frequency of information search and the lack of trust in the search results, we discuss the importance of digital and e-Health literacy, primarily within medical professionals.","output":"Importance of Digital Literacy in the Process of Confronting the Stress During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"Etude SeroCOVIDial : evaluation de la seroconversion SARS-CoV-2 chez les patients hemodialyses chroniques et leurs soignants, etude de cohorte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes the case of a 13-year-old male patient presenting with functional small bowel obstruction The child was also observed to have persistent tachycardia, and repeal cardiac examination revealed a new-onset cardiac murmur and a wallop rhythm Acute viral myocarditis was clinically suspected, prompting further cardiac evaluations including electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (echo), and cardiac enzyme panel Both EKG and echo findings suggested acute myocardial injury, in addition to elevated levels of cardiac enzymes and other inflammatory markers Considering the ongoing pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection was suspected, but reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative Because multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may occur later in the course of COVID-19 illness, a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was performed, with positive results To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of COVID-19 presenting as functional intestinal obstruction We present this case to share our findings on this unique manifestation of COVID-19 with pediatric colleagues We also engage in a brief review of MIS-C","output":"COVID-19 Infection in a Child Presenting With Functional Intestinal Obstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several experts have warned that the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated confinement measures may have taken a devastating toll on youth mental health.

EBOV has garnered the lion's share of the attention, fueled by the higher frequency of EBOV outbreaks, high mortality rates and importation into the USA, documented in such popular works as the best-selling novel 'The Hot Zone'. However, recent large outbreaks of hundreds of cases of MARV infection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola with case fatalities approaching 90% dramatically highlight its lethal potential. Although no vaccines or antiviral drugs for MARV are currently available, remarkable progress has been made over the last few years in developing potential countermeasures against MARV in nonhuman primate models.

To address this issue, we need to completely understand the prevalence of and factors related to the IP and ways to resolve/overcome IP feelings. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the existing evidence regarding the IP among nursing students and nurses and determine gaps that can be addressed in future research. We conducted our study based on the scoping review methodological framework proposed by Arksey and OMalley (2005) and advanced by Levac et al. (2010). After searching the Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, Web of Science and ProQuest databases, we identified 11 studies for inclusion in this review. We found that while the IP exists in nursing students and nurses, clinical nurse specialist students and final-year nursing students are at significant risk of impostor behavior. We also found that research in the nursing field has focused on the prevalence of and factors related to the IP, but few studies have addressed ways to resolve/overcome IP feelings.

In particular, many argue that the context of social media itself may make people particularly susceptible to the influence of false claims. Here, we test that claim by asking whether simply considering whether to share news on social media reduces peoples ability to identify truth versus falsehood. In a large online experiment (N=3,157 Americans quota-matched to the national distribution of age, gender, ethnicity, and geographic region) examining COVID-19 and political news, we find support for this possibility. Compared to a baseline where participants judged only the accuracy of each headline, we observed worse truth discernment when participants also indicated their sharing intentions. Conversely, sharing discernment was substantially higher when participants also rated accuracy, relative to a baseline where sharing intentions were elicited without rating accuracy. These results suggest people may be particularly vulnerable to believing false claims on social media due to fundamental features of these platforms C which is particularly concerning given that it is hard to imagine social media without sharing.","output":"Social Media Sharing Reduces Truth Discernment (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Clinical outcomes after coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) have been well described, including persistent symptoms and abnormalities on pulmonary function tests and imaging. However, the presence and underlying mechanism of functional impairments after COVID-19 remain unclear. Methods: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction were recruited from a hospital in Yucatan, Mexico. Patients who were able to complete surveys, pulmonary function tests, and 6-minute walk tests within 30-90 days after symptom onset were included. COVID-19 severity based on the location of treatment and need for supplemental oxygen was categorized as follows: mild (ambulatory, no hypoxemia), moderate (ambulatory, supplemental oxygen (O2)  5 l/min), or severe (hospitalised, O2 &gt; 5 l/min without invasive mechanical ventilation). The association between COVID-19 severity and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) was determined using multivariable linear regression, and underlying mechanisms for reduced 6MWD were then explored. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were used to determine the association between potential predictor variables (Borg dyspnea, Borg fatigue, and end-exercise SpO2) and 6MWD. A final model with Borg dyspnea and end-exercise SpO2 as co-primary endpoints was performed to explore the independent relationship of these two predictors with 6MWD. All models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index (BMI). Results: There were 148 eligible patients with a mean age of 4714 years and BMI of 327kg/m2, with 66% males and 19% current or past-smokers. There were 26% patients with mild, 10% with moderate, and 64% with severe COVID-19 illness. The mean follow-up time was 59 days. The mean 6MWD was 450104m (8319% predicted). Patients with severe COVID-19 had a lower 6MWD compared to patients with mild COVID-19 (- 52m [95%CI -88,-15], p=0.006). There was no difference in 6MWD between mild and moderate COVID-19. For every unit increase, Borg dyspnea (coefficient -21m [95%CI -31,-10]) and end-exercise SpO2 (coefficient 13m [95%CI 8,18]) were associated with 6MWD (both p&lt;0.001);however, Borg fatigue was not. When Borg dyspnea and end-exercise SpO2 were included as co-primary predictors, both variables remained independently associated with reduced 6MWD with coefficients of -13m (95%CI -23,-2) and 10m (95%CI 5,16), respectively, after adjusting for covariates (Table 1). Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly lower 6MWD compared to those with mild disease. Exertional dyspnea and hypoxemia were independent predictors of lower 6MWD, suggesting that dyspnea related to hypoxemia is not the sole driver of reduced functional capacity in COVID- 19 survivors.","output":"Predictors of functional outcome after COVID-19 illness: A prospective study in mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper builds on a body of work over the decades that examines how East Yorkers give and receive support. We go beyond the earlier work taking into consideration communication technologies and how they play a role in the ways people exchange social support across the life course. We draw on 101 in-depth interviews conducted in 2013C2014 to shed light on the support networks of a sample of East York residents and discern the role of communication technologies in the exchange of different types of social support across age groups. Our findings show that not much has changed since the 1960s in terms of the social ties that our sample of East Yorkers have, and the types of support mobilized via social networks: companionship, small and large services, emotional aid, and financial support. What has changed is how communication technologies interweave in complex ways with different types of social ties (partners, siblings, friends, etc.) to mobilize social support. We found that communication technologies helped siblings and extended kin to increase the frequency of interaction and help exchange support at a distance. Communication technologies helped solidify friendship ties by providing a continuous flow of interaction.

To date no studies have analyzed the role played by the different dimensions of psychological distress quarantine induced in patients with epilepsy. Methods: We included a total of 40 patients, 18 suffered from generalized, and 22 from focal epilepsy. The patients previously seen in the outpatient clinic during the prelockdown period between January and February 2020 were re-evaluated after the lockdown period of March and April 2020. Psychological distress was evaluated by using the three subscales of Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) tapping intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal related to traumatic event. Results: As for the overall sample, the number of epileptic attacks was significantly higher at post-lockdown than at pre-lockdown. The same pattern of results was observed for patients with high scores on IES-R Intrusion and IES-R Avoidance subscales. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that: 1) higher scores on IES-R Intrusion subscale were associated with higher age, female sex, and higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale;2) higher scores on IES-R Hyperarousal subscales were related to higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale;3) higher scores on IES-R Avoidance scale were associated with higher age, and higher scores on HADS-Anxiety subscale. Conclusion: The frequency of epileptic seizures increased during lockdown (months March and April) when compared to pre-lockdown period (months January and February).

Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use, and length of ED visit. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); EMBASE (1988 to December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to November week 4, 2011); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (8 December 2011); HealthStar (1966 to 2009); BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December 2011); CAB Abstracts (1973 to December 2011); CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007); and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi-RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants.Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence is insufficient to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial in terms of reducing rates of antibiotic usage, urine investigations and blood investigations, but are not statistically significant due to lack of power. Rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X-rays in the ED. A large trial addressing the effect on antibiotic usage is needed.","output":"Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study examined how socio-demographic, climate and population health characteristics shaped the geospatial variability in excess mortality patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. METHODS: We used Serfling regression models to estimate all-cause excess mortality rates for all 32 Mexican states. The association between socio-demographic, climate, health indicators and excess mortality rates were determined using multiple linear regression analyses. Functional data analysis characterized clusters of states with distinct excess mortality growth rate curves. RESULTS: The overall all-cause excess deaths rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico until April 10, 2021 was estimated at 39.66 per 10 000 population. The lowest excess death rates were observed in southeastern states including Chiapas (12.72) and Oaxaca (13.42), whereas Mexico City had the highest rate (106.17), followed by Tlaxcala (51.99). We found a positive association of excess mortality rates with aging index, marginalization index, and average household size (P < 0.001) in the final adjusted model (Model R(2)=77%). We identified four distinct clusters with qualitatively similar excess mortality curves. CONCLUSION: Central states exhibited the highest excess mortality rates, whereas the distribution of aging index, marginalization index, and average household size explained the variability in excess mortality rates across Mexico.","output":"Geospatial Variability in Excess Death Rates during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico: Examining Socio Demographic, Climate and Population Health Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A serological COVID-19 Multiplex Assay was developed and validated using serum samples from convalescent patients and those collected prior to the 2020 pandemic.

A comparison of synthesized and mammalian expressed RBD proteins revealed clear advantages of mammalian expression. Antibodies directed against NP strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay titers (r(sp) = 0.726), while anti-RBD correlation was moderate (r(sp) = 0.436).

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 490 years (IQR 410-580). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50-130]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.

MS exhibited shorter ventilation time (6.18  1.86 versus 10.68  12.78 h; p = 0.029) and intensive care stays (33.27  19.75 versus 49.42  47.1 h; p = 0.037). Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were compared, and MS group exhibited fewer transfusions (1.18  0.89 versus 1.7  0.97 units; p = 0.002), fewer pulmonary complications (1 (2%) versus 2 (3.8%); p < 0.001), and less sternotomy wound infection (1 (2%) versus 5 (9.6%); p = 0.048). Total operative mortality of 4.46% was recorded (n = 5). Significant cost reduction was recorded favoring MS; central cannulation saved $907.16 and carried a total cost reduction of $580 (9.3%) when compared with the FS approach (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: With a lack of logistics in developing countries, MIAVR not only has a cosmetic advantage but carries a significant reduction in blood use, respiratory complications, pain, and cost. MIAVR can be feasible, with a rapid learning curve in developing centers.","output":"Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with central cannulation: A cost-benefit analysis in a developing country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing number and variety of quail are being kept for food production, experimental use, release on hunting preserves, preservation of endangered species, zoological display, and as companion birds.

METHODS Pubmed, Ovid, Embase, SCI database, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were searched. The primary endpoints analyzed were cosmetic result and the postoperative pain (at 6 and 24 h) and the secondary endpoints were operating time, hospital stay, incidence of overall postoperative complications, wound-related complications, and port-site hernia. RESULTS Six hundred fifty-nine patients (SILC-349, CLC-310) were analyzed from nine randomized controlled trials. The objective postoperative pain scores at 6 and 24 h and the hospital stay were similar in both groups. The total postoperative complications, wound-related problems, and port-site hernia formation, though higher in SILC, were also comparable in both groups. SILC had significantly favorable cosmetic scoring compared to CLC [weighted mean difference = 1.0, p = 0.0001]. The operating time was significantly longer in SILC [weighted mean difference = 15.63, p = 0.0001].

One of the key challenges in designing maternal immunization trials is that developing exclusion criteria requires understanding and quantifying the background risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in the pregnancy being studied, which can occur independent of any intervention and be unrelated to vaccine administration. The Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA) project has developed and published case definitions and guidelines for data collection, analysis, and evaluation of maternal immunization safety in trials involving pregnant women. Complementing this work, we sought to understand how to best assess obstetric risk of adverse outcomes and differentiate it from the assessment of vaccine safety. Quantification of obstetric risk is based on prior and current obstetric, and maternal medical history. We developed a step-wise approach to evaluate and quantify obstetric and maternal risk factors in pregnancy based on review of published literature and guidelines, and critically assessed these factors in the context of designing inclusion and exclusion criteria for maternal vaccine studies. We anticipate this risk assessment evaluation may assist clinical trialists with study design decisions, including selection of exclusion criteria for vaccine trials involving pregnant women, consideration of sub-group classification, such as high or low risk subjects, or schedule considerations, such as preferred trimester of gestation for an intervention during pregnancy.

Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS: : The new module was implemented in CARDIOSIM?, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to P(IABP) generator and resistances. P(IABP) generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing.We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS: : The results have shown that our simulation reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS: : The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM? presented in this work allows to simulate the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance.

However, there is little evidence of ISH models for non-homeless people with severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of ISH by comparing the clinical outcomes of a newly implemented ISH service with regular housing and support services. METHODS: A total of 58 adults with a broad spectrum of mental disorders experiencing housing problems were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (IG) with the possibility to use the ISH service in Zurich providing targeted, individual and flexible support for housing problems or to the control group (CG) with regular housing and support services currently available (trial registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03815604). RESULTS: After 12 months, almost all participants of the IG were able to live independently and need for inpatient treatment could be significantly reduced. Service utilization varied between 2 and 79 h. In the CG, 70% of the participants wanted to join a waiting list for the ISH service. The results indicated that IHS was comparable to regular housing and support services in terms of social inclusion and other social and clinical outcomes such as quality of life, capabilities, needs, mental state and functioning (p's > 0.05). The costs of service utilization were on average 115 Swiss Francs (about 124 USD) per participant per month.

Method: this is a reflection based on the Theory of Complexity, according to Edgar Morin, and on articles addressing the new coronavirus. Results: the experiences during the pandemic showed economic, social, health, cultural, ethical, and moral difficulties in relation to the older adults. Facing the uncertainties of COVID-19 teaches about the attitude towards this inevitable involvement in the individual and collective life, as well as in the history of the country and the world - a problem aggravated by the fears of humanity. Therefore, adapting society and remodeling it with regard to relationships with the older adults can translate into success against the pandemic disease. This induces thought reform, reorganizing the understanding of the older adults, which currently involves scattered, disjoint, compartmentalized, and excluding thinking. This reform is broad, deep, paradigmatic, cultural, ethical, and moral, which strengthens the culture of aging, propagating and democratizing the poetry of living, allowing the older adults to know the beauty of emotions, and to discover their own truths through the masterpieces of their lives. However, this intention presupposes a metamorphosis of individualism, oppression, and exclusion, in whose context gerontological nursing is fundamental. Conclusion: the transformations experienced during the pandemic may be the prelude to changing relationships with the older adults, through multiple reforming and transforming processes that come together, by the strengthening of gerontological nursing.

Such lockdowns are characterised by loneliness, which is known to adversely impact mental health. Other factors, such as video gaming, have previously been associated with positive mental health outcomes. Indeed, evidence suggests that lockdowns led to a substantial increase in the number of people engaging with gaming. Therefore, in the present paper, we investigated the relationship between video gaming, loneliness, and mental health outcomes using online survey measures during three national lockdowns. We found that depression, anxiety, and stress increased from baseline during the first lockdown only, while loneliness increased relative to baseline in all three lockdowns. Time spent gaming had no direct relationship with mental health outcomes, nor was this relationship moderated by loneliness. While lockdown alone did not impact mental health, loneliness during lockdown was consistently associated with poor mental health outcomes. Our results add to the existing body of literature and emphasise the need for targeted public mental health interventions to improve public mental health following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods (P > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group (P = 0.001).

METHOD: Using a biopsychosocial model, the effects of socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender at birth, socio-professional category, sexual orientation), lockdown conditions (material factors: urban density of the place of residence, surface area of the place of residence during lockdown), social characteristics: living with a partner during lockdown, presence of children during lockdown) and psychosocial history (attachment styles) on anxiety - evaluated on the GAD7 - and depression - evaluated on the MDI - were investigated. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR=1.647, CI 95%=1.647-2.530; Depression: AOR=1.622, CI 95%=1.274-2.072). Bisexual individuals had an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms (AOR=1.962, CI 95%=1.544-2.490) and depression (AOR=1.799, CI 95%=1.394-2.317). For homosexuals, only links with depression were observed (AOR=1.757, CI 95%=1.039-2.906). People in a situation of economic vulnerability were more prone to anxiety disorders (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=1.791, CI 95%=1.147-2.790) or depression (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=2.581, CI 95%=1.633-4.057).

METHODS: To investigate gene expression in periodontitis, we analyzed the expression of specific genes from (1) the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset of 247 human gingival tissues and (2) an experimentally-induced periodontitis mouse model. Human gingival tissues with or without periodontitis were immunohistochemically stained using an anti-TMPRSS2 antibody. Analysis of the TMPRSS2 promoter was performed using a ChIP-Atlas dataset. TMPRSS2 expression was detected in cultured human keratinocytes using quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR and Western blot analysis.

The purpose of this study was to explore the systems, strategies, and resources that hospital administrators and prescribers used to implement the 2017 North Carolina Strengthen Opioid Prevention (STOP) Act opioid prescribing limits, which limited initial prescriptions to a five (for acute) or seven (for post-surgical) days supply. METHODS: We interviewed 14 hospital administrators and 38 prescribers with degrees in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, business administration and public health working across North Carolina. Interview guides, informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, explored barriers and facilitators to implementation. Interview topics included communication, resources, and hospital system support. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, then analyzed using flexible coding, integrating inductive and deductive coding, to inform analytic code development and identify themes. RESULTS: We identified three main themes around implementation of STOP act mandated prescribing limits: organizational communication, prescriber education, and changes in the electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Administrators reflected on implementation in the context of raising awareness and providing reminders to facilitate changes in prescriber behavior, operationalized through email and in-person communications as well as dedicated resources to EMR changes. Prescribers noted administrative communications about prescribing limits often focused on legality, suggesting a directive of the organizations policy rather than a passive reminder. Prescribers expressed a desire for more spaces to have their questions answered and resources for patient communications. While hospital administrators viewed compliance with the law as a priority, prescribers reflected on concerns for adequately managing their patients pain and limited time for clinical care. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital administrators and prescribers approached implementation of the STOP act prescribing limits with different mindsets. While administrators were focused on policy compliance, prescribers were focused on their patients needs. Strategies to implement the mandate then had to balance patient needs with policy compliance. As states continue to legislate to prevent opioid overdose deaths, understanding how laws are implemented by healthcare systems and prescribers will improve their effectiveness through tailoring and maximizing available resources.

The new virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family and the Betacoronavirus genus, according to sequencing and phylogenetic studies. Genomic sequence analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS. SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious and the high level of COVID-19 community transmission has led to a growing pandemic. Although infections in most patients with COVID-19 are moderate or mild, 20% of the patients develop severe or critical disease. COVID- 19 may affect a wide range of organs and tissues, including respiratory, digestive system, nervous system, and skin. Patients with COVID-10 have been confirmed to have renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous system problems in addition to pulmonary involvement. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is being investigated, but it is possible that the organ damage might in part be caused by direct viral damage (detection of inclusion bodies in tissues, such as the kidneys), dysregulation of the immune system, renin-angiotensin system, bradykinin pathway, and coagulation, as well as host genetic factors and their polymorphisms, which may affect the disease severity.

The aim of the current study was to investigate how the pandemic has affected the burnout, stress, and emotional well-being of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) providers and staff in the New York and New Jersey epicenter. METHODS: The study was conducted in June 2020 during the pandemic through an electronic survey. The survey contained questions surrounding demographics, pandemic experiences, and validated burnout, stress, and emotional well-being measures. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two PHO providers and staff responded to the survey. Overall, half of the participants reported high levels of burnout, average stress scores were in the mild-moderate range, and the majority scored in the none-to-mild symptomatology range for their well-being. Self-reported burnout levels before the pandemic and geographic work location were statistically significant risk factors for all outcomes. Additional predictors for some outcomes included hospital role, lack of trust in leadership, and deployment. The majority of participants (87.0%) reported that their hospitals had made mental health resources related to COVID-19 available to them but only 8.4% reported having used them. CONCLUSION: PHO providers and staff in the NYC/NJ area are experiencing a range of emotional experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority are not using current resources. With the continuation of the pandemic, we must continue efforts to improve provider and staff distress to mitigate the degree of potential negative short-term and long-term impact.","output":"Well-Being of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Providers and Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the New York and New Jersey Epicenter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the problems faced by male conscripts into the former South African Defence Force.

Additionally, patients themselves were reluctant to pursue elective surgery. This presented us a unique opportunity to reassess the natural history of symptomatic nephrolithiasis given potentially prolonged periods of conservative management. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with flank pain secondary to nephrolithiasis from March to April of 2020 (COVID peak period of elective surgery limitations), and a comparative cohort from March and April 2019. Assessed outcomes included definitive stone treatment at initial presentation to the ER, rate of spontaneous stone passage, and time to elective surgery from initial ER presentation. Chi-square or Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized for dependent binary variables and continuous variables, respectively. A Kaplan Meier analysis was used to demonstrate differences in time to elective surgery between the two eras. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups (Table). Patients discharged from the ER were more often offered medical expulsive therapy (71.6% vs 55.0%, p=0.026) during the COVID era. The rate of surgical stone management or stent placement at initial presentation did not differ, however, discharged patients waited longer from initial ER presentation to elective surgery (55.3 vs 33.1 days, p=0.02). Spontaneous stone passage rates were similar between groups despite the delay, and similar stone location and stone size between eras. CONCLUSIONS: During the height of the COVID pandemic, ER patients with symptomatic stones had similar characteristics at presentation but were more often offered MET. Spontaneous stone passage during the pandemic was no different than in 2019, despite a significant difference in time to elective surgery from initial presentation to the ER with flank pain .","output":"Evaluating spontaneous stone passage rates during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While causing over 150,000 deaths in Africa, the spread of the COVID-19 virus did not produce the expected hecatomb. Clearly, the crisis is not over and with the emergence of new variants, the death toll could increase significantly. So far, however, COVID-19 has caused fewer African victims than elsewhere. Explaining this reality remains difficult and speculative. It appears, however, that a major reason might be the continents very young population and the fact that it enjoys relatively low levels of obesity. These two factors have played a significant role in the high COVID-19 mortality rate in the most affected industrialized countries. In addition, many African countries have learned how to deal with health emergencies from their past experiences with other major pandemics. A final and more controversial explanation of the low death rate in the region is that in their fight against malaria, Africans have used hydroxychloroquinea medicine that has allegedly curbed the effects of COVID-19on a mass scale and for generations. COVID-19 has also had crippling consequences for the continents already debilitated economies and raised poverty to alarming levels.

To address the goal of timely and equitable access to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) care, health planners require information at the regional and local level to determine the RA prevalence and the associated health care needs. METHODS: Using Alberta Health administrative databases, we identified RA\\\\prevalent cases (April 1, 2015\\\\March 31, 2016) on the basis of a validated case definition. Age\\\\ and sex\\\\standardized prevalence rates per 1000 population members and the standardized rates ratio (SRR) were calculated. We applied Global Morans I and Gi* hotspot analysis using three different weight matrices to explore the geospatial pattern of RA prevalence in Alberta. RESULTS: Among 38 350 RA cases (68% female; n = 26 236), the prevalence rate was 11.81 cases per 1000 population members (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.80\\\\11.81) after age and sex standardization. Approximately 60% of RA cases resided in metro (Calgary and Edmonton) and moderate metro areas. The highest rate was observed in rural areas (14.46; 95% CI 14.45\\\\14.47; SRR 1.28), compared with the lowest in metro areas (10.69; 95% CI 10.68\\\\10.69; SRR 0.82). The RA prevalence across local geographic areas ranged from 4.7 to 30.6 cases. The Global Morans I index was 0.15 using three different matrices (z\\\\score 3.96\\\\4.24).

This study aimed to explore the experience of carers of people diagnosed with dementia during or following a hospital admission in order to identify factors that had prevented them from seeking help beforehand. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 informal carers including adults caring for a parent, a friend or a spouse diagnosed with dementia between 2010-2019, following an acute hospital admission for a physical health problem, having not sought help previously. MAIN FINDINGS Carers created a 'bubble of normalisation' around themselves and the person living with dementia (PLWD) to reject the label of dementia and protect the PLWD from a loss of independence, discrimination and prejudice they felt would be the result of a diagnosis. Carers struggled to talk to the PLWD about dementia reinforcing denial and stigma. Post-diagnosis carers felt unsupported and questioned the value of diagnosis. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS Stigma related to images of dementia as a disease that takes away independence and identity prevented discussion about dementia between carers and the PLWD. A lack of open discussion about memory concerns between health care professionals and carers also served to delay diagnosis.","output":"The Bubble of Normalisation: A Qualitative Study of Carers of People With Dementia Who Do Not Seek Help for a Diagnosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Injected glucocorticoid's (corticosteroids) are commonly used in musculoskeletal practice. The current global COVID\\\\19 pandemic has increased attention on the potential for locally injected corticosteroids to exert a systemic immunosuppressive effect and the implications this may have in relation to COVID\\\\19 infection and vaccination. AIM: This narrative review summarises the evidence regarding the potential systemic immunosuppressive effects of peripheral corticosteroid injections in relation to the ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHOD: A narrative review was selected to allow inclusion of evidence related to a diverse range of topics relevant to this subject in order to provide the most comprehensive and clinically relevant guidance for clinicians. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Current evidence demonstrates that cytotoxic, phagocytic and antigen presenting cells involved in both the innate and adaptive immune responses are suppressed for 48 h post\\\\injection and messenger cytokines that are integral to immune function are suppressed for over 96 h post\\\\injection. This potentially reduces an individual's ability to prevent viral infection, limit early viral replication, and delays activation of adaptive immune mechanisms (T and B lymphocytes) and subsequent viral clearance and elimination. The hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis can be suppressed for 2C4 weeks or longer following peripheral corticosteroid injections. The role of the HPA axis in immune function is not fully understood, however this could potentially indicate longer lasting immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: This review found evidence of suppression of immune cell numbers for the first 48 h post\\\\injection, cytokines for over 96 h post\\\\injection and HPA axis suppression lasting for 2C4 weeks or longer. There is currently no evidence that these physiological changes translate into a clinically meaningful increased risk of COVID\\\\19 infection or related morbidity or mortality, but there is also no persuasive evidence that they do not. This review discusses the implications of the current evidence in relation to shared decision making, informed consent, risk management and COVID\\\\19 vaccination to provide clinicians with a pragmatic guide to help navigate the current uncertainty regarding the potential immunosuppressive effects of peripheral corticosteroid injections.","output":"The systemic immunosuppressive effects of peripheral corticosteroid injections: A narrative review of the evidence in the context of COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO convened an Advisory Group (AG) to consider the feasibility, potential value and limitations of establishing a closely-monitored challenge model of experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in healthy adult volunteers.

Among presented data, we were surprised to see that serum albumin (ALB) concentrations during hospitalization did not significantly predict patient death at the multivariate analysis (MA), even if 86.6% of patients showed ALB values <35 g/L, i.e. the lower reference limit. In a similar COVID-19 population enrolled in our national reference center for infectious diseases, we recently analysed a group of common biochemistry tests, including ALB, as major predictor of COVID-19 severity (2). Although the patient rate showing an ALB <35 g/L was quite similar (89%) to that of Hundt's study, at MA low ALB concentrations remained significantly associated (P=0.003) with higher odds of death, ALB values &#8804;18 g/L giving a positive likelihood ratio of 12.2 for predicting in-hospital death. In terms of absolute ALB levels in the respective populations, it is however somewhat difficult to compare our results with those of Hundt et al. as the authors do not mention the methodology used to determine ALB in their hospital network. It is known that immunoturbidimetric assays for ALB determination, such as the one in use in our institution, are specific for the ALB measurement contrary to nonspecific colorimetric methods, which are in use in the majority of U.S. healthcare institutions, also reacting with proteins other than ALB (3). The well-known lack of specificity of the latter methods, especially at low ALB and high globulin (including \\"acute phase reactants\\") concentrations, i.e. the typical COVID-19 situation, may have influenced the Hundt's results. Figure 1 depicts ALB distribution in our COVID-19 patients showing that even survivors displayed a median (interquartile range) [28 g/L (25-32)] quite lower that patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled by Hundt et al. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the inability of ALB to predict death in the Hundt's study was due to spuriously higher ALB values measured with non-specific methods in the evaluated COVID-19 patients. The accuracy of ALB methods may become critical in COVID-19 cases, where ALB is decreased but acute-phase proteins are increased, and thus use of immunological assays should be preferred in this condition (4).","output":"Letter to the Editor: Serum Albumin in COVID-19: A Good Example in Which Analytical and Clinical Performance of a Laboratory Test Are Strictly Intertwined"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a narrative of a behavioral health referral for a patient experiencing anxiety regarding an upcoming knee surgery Based on the referral note, the provider anticipated the anxiety was related to fear of needles;however, the patient reported the anxiety was race-related and a direct result of media attention around the Black Lives Matter movement This narrative shares the provider's reflections on her own biases and makes suggestions on how healthcare providers can improve understanding of minority patients' experiences and their own implicit bias (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Unique healthcare-related anxiety in the time of racial injustice and COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four major diseases, namely cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and infertility have been severely affecting the global human population The World Health Organization has taken special initiatives to control these diseases by 2030 Since these diseases are closely related to genetic causes, it is highly essential to treat the root cause(s) or the source which is at the point of genesis Here we hypothesize a strategy to prevent and treat such diseases at the levels of gamete and embryo, which will enable us to control them at their source In the wake of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, identification of genes related to the defence mechanism against the virus in the recovered patients seems of utmost importance and may prove useful in future prevention and treatment [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Current Science (00113891) is the property of Indian Academy of Sciences and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Diagnosis and treatment of genome at the gamete and embryo levels: the probable future of major diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel thiophene-arylamide compounds derived from the noncovalent decaprenylphosphoryl--d-ribose 2-epimerase (DprE1) inhibitor TCA1 through a structure-based scaffold hopping strategy.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of all applicants to an academic emergency medicine residency program in 2020-2021. Applicants were selected for interview by program leadership. Applicants were asked standardized open-ended questions during their residency interviews regarding their thoughts of their schools policies restricting in-person clinical education, and why they agreed or disagreed with these policies. Study questions were asked by one of two faculty members who interviewed 100% of applicants. The questions were intentionally left open-ended to facilitate analysis through grounded theory and identify common themes. Responses and demographics were recorded by each interviewer, then deidentified. Trained, blinded investigators not involved in the interview process reviewed the spreadsheet and categorized applicants' open-ended responses. The study was reviewed and exempted by the IRB. Results: Over 900 applications were received. 199 students were interviewed. 32.2% were female and 67.3% were male;one was not recorded. The majority of applicants were from medical schools in the Northeastern US (69.3%), with the remainder from schools located in the Southeast (17.1%), Midwest (8.5%), West (4%), and Southwest (0.5%). More than half of students (n=130, 65.3%) at least partially agreed with the policy to restrict their in-person contact with patients, or agreed it made sense initially. These students most commonly cited the importance of medical schools prioritizing student safety (29.2%), conservation of PPE (27.7%), and reducing disease spread (14.7%) as contributing factors to their opinions. Many students at least partially disagreed with the policy, or felt the policy made sense initially, but was not adapted for changing circumstances (n=109, 54.8%). The most commonly cited reasons for their disagreement were educational shortfalls (36.7%), feeling disenfranchised from their field and professional calling (25.7%), and feelings the policy represented a missed opportunity, with students underutilized when they should have had a role in this pandemic with an eye to preparation for the next (14.7%). Twenty-nine percent of students expressed mixed feelings regarding the policy, with both positive and negative factors. Ten percent did not express agreement or disagreement.

METHODS In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, all patients with COVID-19 admitted to our emergency intensive care unit from March 2020 to August 2021 were categorized into tocilizumab-treated and tocilizumab-na?ve groups, and the incidence of bacteremia and other factors between the two groups were compared. Patients with bacteremia were further classified into tocilizumab-treated and tocilizumab-na?ve groups to determine if fever and inflammatory reactants were suppressed. RESULTS Overall, 144 patients were included in the study, 51 of whom received tocilizumab, which was administered on the day of admission. Further, of the 24 (16.7%) patients with bacteremia, 13 were in the tocilizumab-treated group. Results revealed a significant difference in the C-reactive protein level (p < 0.001) at the onset of bacteremia between the tocilizumab-treated group [median 0.42 mg/dL (0.27-0.44 mg/dL)] and the tocilizumab-na?ve group [7.48 mg/dL (4.56-13.9 mg/dL)]. The median number of days from admission to onset of bacteremia was not significantly different between the tocilizumab-treated group [10 days (9-12 days)] and the tocilizumab-na?ve group [9 days (7.5-11 days)] (p = 0.48). There was no significant difference in fever between the groups. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that tocilizumab treatment did not affect the probability of bacteremia. CONCLUSION Treatment of patients with COVID-19 with tocilizumab does not increase the risk of bacteremia. Tocilizumab suppresses C-reactive protein levels but not fever. Therefore, careful monitoring of fever can reduce the risk of missed bacteremia.","output":"Effect of Tocilizumab Treatment on Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Bacteremia: A Retrospective Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT This position paper could be used by oral health stakeholders to convince their government to implement digital oral health program.","output":"Advocacy for a Digital Oral Health That Leaves No One Behind."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past, we viewed lack of response to asthma medications as a rare event.

Olfactory training has recently been used in clinical practice, but no medical treatment is widely accepted. Although there is weak evidence for their value, some physicians use oral corticosteroids as first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to compare combined oral methylprednisolone and olfactory training with olfactory training alone in the management of PIOD. METHODS This prospective cohort study included 131 patients with PIOD over a 2-year period before the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-eight patients who were treated with oral methylprednisolone and olfactory training (group A) were compared with 53 patients who were treated with olfactory training only (group B). Olfactory function was evaluated with \\"Sniffin' Sticks\\" at baseline and 2, 8, and 16 weeks after initial assessment. Patients who improved after steroid treatment underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the paranasal sinuses, skin prick tests, lung spirometry, and sputum eosinophil assessment. RESULTS Oral steroids improved 19.23% of patients (n = 15) of group A. History, clinical evaluation, imaging, and laboratory tests identified an inflammatory background in half of them (n = 8). The remaining 7 had no findings of nasal inflammation, and all had a short history of olfactory dysfunction. Both groups significantly improved in olfactory testing results at the end of the olfactory training scheme without significant difference between them.

Numerous researches have been conducted on the influence of national quarantines on air pollution and the relationship between the abundance of infected cases and mortality caused by this pandemic with air pollutants;however, these investigations are limited in Iran. The present study aims to investigate the correlation between Covid-19 cases and air pollution from a statistical viewpoint in order to evaluate the performance of multiple national lockdowns from February 2020 to August 2021 through measuring changes in air pollutants in the 31 provinces of Iran. Materials and methods: We applied a remote sensing method by employing Sentinel-5P satellite data to analyze changes in PM2.5, CO, and O3 during the three public quarantine periods and their two months earlier. Results: We recognized a considerable positive correlation between PM2.5 and the infected cases (r=0.63, p=0.001) and victims (r=0.41, p=0.001). Moreover, we compared the efficiency of lockdowns and supposed lockdown 2 (November-December 2020) as an only effective quarantine due to a dramatic reduction in PM2.5 (21.2%), CO (0.8%), the infected cases (48.7%), and victims (66.9%) in comparison to the average of its next two months.

It utilizes our recently developed reverse genetic system based on the RNA polymerase I minigenome system for UUK virus used to study replication, encapsidation, and transcription by monitoring reporter gene expression. Here, we have added the glycoprotein precursor expression plasmid together with the minigenome, nucleoprotein, and polymerase to generate VLPs, which incorporate the minigenome and are released into the supernatant. The particles are able to infect new cells, and reporter gene expression can be monitored if the trans-acting viral proteins (RNA polymerase and nucleoprotein) are also expressed in these cells. No minigenome transfer occurred in the absence of glycoproteins, demonstrating that the glycoproteins are absolutely required for the generation of infectious particles. Moreover, expression of glycoproteins alone was sufficient to produce and release VLPs. We show that the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are incorporated into VLPs but are not required for the generation of particles. Morphological analysis of the particles by electron microscopy revealed that VLPs, either with or without minigenomes, display a surface morphology indistinguishable from that of the authentic UUK virus and that they bud into Golgi vesicles in the same way as UUK virus does. This infectious VLP system will be very useful for studying the bunyaviral structural components required for budding and packaging of RNPs and receptor binding and may also be useful for the development of new vaccines for the human pathogens from this family.","output":"Generation and analysis of infectious virus-like particles of uukuniemi virus (bunyaviridae): a useful system for studying bunyaviral packaging and budding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection.

The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis.

We provided an updated overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on circadian rhythms and sleep based on the results of published studies (n=48) in three sections. First, we focus on circadian misalignment due to the pandemic in the general population (including shift workers, health staff, students) and COVID-19 patients and summarize the most critically contributing factors to circadian misalignment. Next, we address sleep difficulties and poor sleep quality during the pandemic, their contributing factors, rate and prevalence, and their effects on both the general population and COVID-19 patients. Finally, we summarize the currently applied/recommended interventions for aligning circadian rhythms and improving sleep quality in both, the general population, and COVID-19 patients during the pandemic situation. Briefly, circadian misalignment and sleep difficulties are common consequences of the pandemic in the general population (with elderly, students, children, health and night-work shifters as risk groups) and COVID-19 patients. Home confinement and its physiological, circadian, and psychological derivates are central to these difficulties. Symptoms severity, treatment progress, recovery duration, and even diagnosis of COVID-19 patients are considerably affected by circadian and sleep difficulties. Behavioral interventions for normalizing the factors that contribute to circadian and sleep difficulties are helpful and recommended.","output":"Circadian disturbances, sleep difficulties and the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growth of COVID-19 cases in India is scaling high over the past weeks despite stringent lockdown policies. This study introduces a GPS-based tool, i.e., lockdown breaching index (LBI), which helps to determine the extent of breaching activities during the lockdown period. It is evaluated using the community mobility reports. This index ranges between 0 and 100, which implies the extent of following the lockdown policies. A score of 0 indicates that civilians strictly adhered to the guidelines while a score of 100 points to complete violation. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is modified to compute the LBI. We considered fifteen states of India, where the spread of coronavirus is relatively dominant. A significant breaching activity is observed during the first phase of lockdown, and the intensity increased in the third and fourth phases of lockdown. Overall breaching activities are dominant in Bihar with LBI of 75.28. At the same time, it is observed that the majority of the people in Delhi adhered to the lockdown policies strictly, as reflected with an LBI score of 47.05, which is the lowest. Though an average rise of 3% breaching activities during the second phase of lockdown (L2.0) with reference to the first phase of lockdown (L1.0) is noticed in all the states, a decreasing trend is noticed in Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Since the beginning of third phase of lockdown L3.0, a significant rise in breaching activities is observed in every state considered for the analysis. The average LBI rise of 16.9% and 27.6% relative to L1.0 is observed at the end of L3.0 and L4.0, respectively. A positive spearman rank correlation of 0.88 is noticed between LBI and the cumulative confirmed cases. This correlation serves as evidence and enlightens the fact that the breaching activities could be one of the possible reasons that contributed to the rise in COVID-19 cases throughout lockdown.","output":"A GPS Data-Based Index to Determine the Level of Adherence to COVID-19 Lockdown Policies in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current methods for viral discovery target evolutionarily conserved proteins that accurately identify virus families but remain unable to distinguish the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viruses.

Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning.

Our aim was, therefore, to assess the long-term impact on quality of life and lung function in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19. METHODS: All patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonitis at Copenhagen University Hospital-Hvidovre, Denmark, were invited to participate in the study 4C5 months after discharge. Of the 160 invited 128 responded positively (80%). Medical history and symptoms were assessed, and patients rated impact on quality of life and functional status with EuroQol-5D-5L and Post Covid Functional Scale. Lung function was assessed by dynamic spirometry and measurement of diffusing capacity. RESULTS: Fatigue, dyspnea, cough and cognitive dysfunction were the most common symptoms. Of 128 patients, 85% had at least one symptom, and 51% reported two or more symptoms. Self-rated Quality of life was impaired assessed by EuroQol 5D-5L, with dimensions Pain or discomfort (61%) and Usual activities (54%) mostly affected. Functional status was significantly worse than before COVID-19 assessed by Post-COVID Functional Scale.

Many published commentaries have proposed plans for pandemic control that are primarily based on mortality rates among older individuals without considering long-term morbidity among individuals of all ages. Reliable estimates of such morbidity are important for patient care, prognosis, and development of public health policy. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Evidence Review: A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, that examined persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Persistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalization or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, long-term, after recovery, long-haul, persistent, outcome, symptom, follow-up, and longitudinal. All English-language articles that presented primary data from cohort studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that had clearly defined and sufficient follow-up were included. Case reports, case series, and studies that described symptoms only at the time of infection and/or hospitalization were excluded. A structured framework was applied to appraise study quality. Findings: A total of 1974 records were identified; of those, 1247 article titles and abstracts were screened. After removal of duplicates and exclusions, 92 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 47 studies were deemed eligible, and 45 studies reporting 84 clinical signs or symptoms were included in the systematic review. Of 9751 total participants, 5266 (54.0%) were male; 30 of 45 studies reported mean or median ages younger than 60 years. Among 16 studies, most of which comprised participants who were previously hospitalized, the median proportion of individuals experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom was 72.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 55.0%-80.0%). Individual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36.0%; IQR, 27.6%-50.0%), fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40.0%; IQR, 31.0%-57.0%), and sleep disorders or insomnia (8 studies; median 29.4%, IQR, 24.4%-33.0%). There were wide variations in the design and quality of the studies, which had implications for interpretation and often limited direct comparability and combinability. Major design differences included patient populations, definitions of time zero (ie, the beginning of the follow-up interval), follow-up lengths, and outcome definitions, including definitions of illness severity. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life. Current studies of symptom persistence are highly heterogeneous, and future studies need longer follow-up, improved quality, and more standardized designs to reliably quantify risks.","output":"Assessment of the Frequency and Variety of Persistent Symptoms Among Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different needle sizes used to obtain blood via jugular venipuncture in cats on routine measures of hemostasis. METHODS This was a prospective, observational, randomized, clinical study carried out at a university teaching hospital. Twenty healthy, client-owned cats were used. Each cat had blood collected via direct venipuncture from both jugular veins. Sampling of the right and left jugular vein was randomized to be collected with either a 22 G or a 25 G needle, respectively, and routine coagulation variables and platelet count were performed on all samples. Values were analyzed for differences in needle size, and site of sample collection. RESULTS There was no difference between the two needle gauges in activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, fibrinogen degradation products, or fibrinogen, or between sampling from the left and right jugular vein. Prothrombin time (PT) was significantly higher when drawn from a 25 G needle (11.7 s) compared with a 22 G needle (11.4 s) ( P = 0.01), but not different in left vs right jugular vein samples.

Several drugs are now being repurposed with the aim of identifying if these drugs provide some level of disease resolution. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), first developed as an antimalarial therapy. There is increasing concern with regards to the efficacy and safety of these agents. The aims of this review are to systematically identify and collate studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Methods and Findings: Searches for (COVID AND chloroquine [title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) and two (COVID AND hydroxychloroquine[title/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) yielded 272 unique articles. Unique articles were manually checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and also subjected to a quality appraisal assessment. A total of 19 articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy-five percent of observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy recorded no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes, between COVID-19 patients given a range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, and the control groups. All clinical trials and 82% of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects found a greater incidence among patients administered a wide range of CQ and/or HCQ doses, with QTc prolongation the most common finding, in addition to its consequences of VT and cardiac arrest. Of the total studies using mortality rate as an end-point, 60% reported no significant change in the risk of death, while 30% showed an elevation, and 10% a depression, in treated relative to control patients. Conclusion: The strongest available evidence suggests that, relative to standard in-hospital management of symptoms, the use of CQ and HCQ to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients has likely been unsafe. At the very least, the poor quality of data failing to find any significant changes in the risk of VT should preclude definitive judgment on drug safety until the completion of high-quality randomised clinical trials.","output":"Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and COVID-19: systematic review and narrative synthesis of efficacy and safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Email threat is a serious issue for enterprise security, which consists of various malicious scenarios, such as phishing, fraud, blackmail and malvertisement.

During hospitalization in the ICU, patients with COVID-19 who died were compared with those who were discharged. A second analysis compared patients who developed HAI with those who did not in the ICU. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders. Results 400 patients were included. HAI occurred in 123 patients (31%). The most frequent infection was of the lower respiratory tract (67%). Independent risk factors for death were: age (OR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.43-2.15; p<0.0001), clinical severity score (OR: 2.21; 95%CI:1.70-2.87; p<0.0001), renal replacement therapy (OR: 12.8; 95%CI: 5.78-28.6; p<0.0001), and HAI (OR: 5.9; 95%CI: 3.31-10.5; p<0.0001); while days between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission were protective (OR: 0.93; 95%CI:0.88-0.98; p=0.017).

Changes in vaccine doses administered to children and the effects of those changes on up-to-date status were examined for vaccinations recommended at milestone ages corresponding to the end of an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation period for one or more vaccines (4).","output":"Decline in Child Vaccination Coverage During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Michigan Care Improvement Registry, May 2016-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 282 million cases and almost 5.5 million deaths (WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard, 2022).

The pandemic-related welfare responses after the first wave were similar across all three types of western democracies, but the differences in pandemic outcomes remained. The somewhat better outlook of the Liberal states could be attributed to the so-called social democratization of the Anglo-American democracies, but also to the fact that neoliberalism could have flattened the previous differences between the welfare states typologies and could have brought states closer to each other, ideologically speaking, in terms of welfare provision.","output":"COVID-19 amongst western democracies: A welfare state analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytic fungi viz., Nigrospora sphaerica (E1 and E6), Subramaniula cristata (E7), and Polycephalomyces sinensis (E8 and E10) were isolated from the medicinal plant, Shirazi thyme (Zataria multiflora).

The hospice made the decision to assist the local trust and admit palliative patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 into six pressure beds. Building on the partnership between the hospice and local trust, the beds were accessed by the trust through a new patient pathway of admission between October 2020 and March 2021.AimTo achieve a timely, safe and appropriate transfer of COVID-19 criteria led patients from primary to hospice care.MethodsA new admission transfer criteria was introduced C patients with non-complex palliative care needs who were COVID-19 positive. A service level agreement was established to enable a consistent and collaborative approach. The ward sisters held daily morning meetings to discuss identified admissions. A designated wing was established to care for COVID-19 positive patients to prevent transmission.ResultsA total of 40 admissions were taken since Nov. 2020. The transfer of acute patients to hospice care resulted in 369 saved bed days. Families were allowed precious time during the last days of life for 65% of patients in a calm and caring environment maintaining privacy and dignity for patients in their last days. Able to facilitate safe discharges home when patients recovered from the virus. Despite the implemented patient criteria, all patients transferred still required medical input due to their complex needs.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that working in partnership with the wider health and care system improves patient access to hospice care. Invaluable patient and family experience provides strong evidence for the continuation of the additional six beds. Admission criteria must be robust and flexible.

Although most children experience minor symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection, some have severe complications including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Neuroblastoma patients may be at higher risk of severe infection as treatment requires immunocompromising chemotherapy and SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated tropism for nervous cells. To date, there is no sufficient epidemiological data on neuroblastoma patients with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated datasets of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected neuroblastoma patients to assess for key genes involved with SARS-CoV-2 infection as possible neuroblastoma prognostic and infection biomarkers. We hypothesized that ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB, which are associated with viral-cell entry, are potential biomarkers for poor prognosis neuroblastoma and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have analysed three publicly available neuroblastoma gene expression datasets to understand the specific molecular susceptibilities that high-risk neuroblastoma patients have to the virus. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE49711 and GEO GSE62564 are the microarray and RNA-Seq data, respectively, from 498 neuroblastoma samples published as part of the Sequencing Quality Control initiative. TARGET, contains microarray data from 249 samples and is part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative. ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB were identified through their involvement in both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer pathogenesis. In-depth statistical analysis using Kaplan-Meier, differential gene expression, and Cox multivariate regression analysis, demonstrated that overexpression of ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB is significantly associated with poor-prognosis neuroblastoma samples. These results were seen in the presence of amplified MYCN, unfavourable tumour histology and in patients older than 18 months of age. Previously, we have shown that high levels of the nerve growth factor receptor NTRK1 together with low levels of the phosphatase PTPN6 and TP53 are associated with increased relapse-free survival of neuroblastoma patients. Interestingly, low levels of expression of ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB are associated with this NTRK1-PTPN6-TP53 module, suggesting that low expression levels of these genes are associated with good prognosis. These findings have implications for clinical care and therapeutic treatment. The upregulation of ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB in poor-prognosis neuroblastoma samples suggests that these patients may be at higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, our findings reveal ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated cell entry proteins ACE2, CD147, PPIA, and PPIB in datasets from non SARS-CoV-2 infected neuroblastoma patients, as potential prognostic and infection biomarkers in neuroblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now affected tens of millions of people globally. It is the hope that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will deliver a comprehensive solution to this global pandemic; however, this will require extensive national vaccination programs. Ultimately, clinical conditions and even sudden unexplained death will occur around the time of vaccination, thus a distinction needs to be made between events that are causally related to the vaccine or temporally related to vaccination. This study aimed to estimate the background occurrence of 43 clinical conditions in the Japanese population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2013 to 2019 using data from two large healthcare claims databases (MDV and JMDC) in Japan. The estimated number of new cases and incidence were calculated based on the actual number of new cases identified in the databases. The PubMed and Ichushi-web databases, as well as grey literature such as guidelines and government statistics, were also searched to identify any publications related to incidence of these conditions in Japan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The estimates of the number of total cases and incidence were similar for the MDV and JMDC databases for some diseases. In addition, some estimates were similar to those in the scientific literature. For example, from the MDV and JMDC databases, estimates of incidence of confirmed Bells palsy in 2019 were 41.7 and 47.9 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively. These estimates were of the same order from the scientific publication. Determining whether clinical conditions occurring around the time of vaccination are causally or only temporally related to vaccination will be critical for public health decision makers as well as for the general public. Comparison of background occurrence at the population level may provide some additional objective evidence for the evaluation of temporality or causality.","output":"The background occurrence of selected clinical conditions prior to the start of an extensive national vaccination program in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Nigeria bears 25% of global malaria burden despite concerted efforts towards its control and elimination.

Episodes were available for free download or streaming on a designated website and popular podcast platforms. Podcast analytics were used to measure public listeners and uptake. RESULTS: Total development time was 90 hours at an estimated cost of $7,091 USD. A total of 10 episodes were released between March 21, 2020 and August 31, 2020. An average of 91.26 hours (range 2-6) was required to generate each episode, including 3.41.26 hours (2-6) for content review and 5.62 hours (4-10) for audio production. An average episode ran for 35.94.3 minutes (28-42). Podcasts recorded a total of 5678 downloads, with an average of 228 and 336 downloads per episode in the first 30 and 90 days, respectively.

Methods: From 11-September-2020 to 05-May-2021, across six sites in the Russian Federation, 496 participants were injected with either placebo or Ad5-nCoV expressing the full-length spike (S) protein from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: Seroconversion (the primary endpoint) rates of 78.5% (95% CI: 73.9; 82.6) against receptor binding domain (RBD), 90.6% (95% CI: 87.2; 93.4) against S protein and 59% (95% CI: 53.3; 64.6) against neutralising SARS-CoV2 antibodies 28 days post-vaccination. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) were also elevated for antibodies against the RBD (405.32 [95% CI: 361.58; 454.46]) and S protein (678.86 [95% CI: 607.44; 754.40]) compared to the GMT of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (16.73 [95% CI: 15.36; 18.22]). Using an IFN-{gamma}ELISpot assay after stimulating the cells with full-length S protein we showed that the Ad5-nCoV vaccine induced the most robust cellular immune response on Days 14 and 28. Up to Day 28, the primary and all secondary endpoints of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine were statistically superior to the placebo (p<0.001).

Measuring the vaccine effectiveness among the most vulnerable in these settings is essential to monitor and improve mitigation strategies. METHODS: We evaluate the early effect of the administration of BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine to individuals older than 64 years residing in LTCFs in Catalonia, Spain. We monitor all the SARS-CoV-2 documented infections and deaths among LTCFs residents once more than 70% of them were fully vaccinated (FebruaryCMarch 2021). We develop a modeling framework based on the relationship between community and LTCFs transmission during the pre-vaccination period (JulyCDecember 2020). We compute the total reduction in SARS-CoV-2 documented infections and deaths among residents of LTCFs over time, as well as the reduction in the detected transmission for all the LTCFs. We compare the true observations with the counterfactual predictions. RESULTS: We estimate that once more than 70% of the LTCFs population are fully vaccinated, 74% (58C81%, 90% CI) of COVID-19 deaths and 75% (36C86%, 90% CI) of all expected documented infections among LTCFs residents are prevented. Further, detectable transmission among LTCFs residents is reduced up to 90% (76C93%, 90% CI) relative to that expected given transmission in the community. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that high-coverage vaccination is the most effective intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and death among LTCFs residents.

However, nomadic Sahelian pastoralists health concerns regarding their livestock and anecdotal reports about trematode infections of Fasciola spp. and Schistosoma spp. in desert-raised animals justified an exploratory study focusing on the lakes of Ounianga in Northern Chad. The aim was to test whether trematode parasites such as Schistosoma spp. occur in human populations living around the Sahara desert lakes of Ounianga Kebir and Ounianga Serir in northern Chad. METHODS: The study was carried out in January 2019 and comprised of three components. First, a cross sectional survey based on a random sample drawn from the population to detect infections with S. haematobium and S. mansoni; second, focus group discussions exploring disease priorities, access to health and health seeking behaviour; and third, surveying water contact sites for intermediate host snails. Samples of trematode parasites and snails were confirmed on species level by molecular genetic methods. For parasitological and malacological surveys descriptive statistics were performed. Qualitative data analysis included the full review of all transcripts, followed by a descriptive and explorative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 258 participants, the overall S. haematobium prevalence using urine filtration was 39.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 33.5C45.1%], with 51.5% of the infected suffering from heavy infection. The intermediate host snail of S. haematobium (Bulinus truncatus) occurred at water contact sites near both study villages, revealing the potential for local transmission. Although a positive S. mansoni point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) test result was obtained from 8.6% (95% CI 5.7C12.8%) of the samples, no intermediate host snails of S. mansoni were found, and the relevance of S. mansoni remains uncertain. Qualitative findings underline the importance of morbidity caused by urinary schistosomiasis, and the lack of access to diagnostics and treatment as a major health concern.

Recently, several patients infected with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were given HCQ, and showed a discrepant response. HCQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and inflammatory cascade by interfering with lysosomal and endosomal activities, and autophagy, impeding virus-membrane fusion, and inhibiting cytokine production resulted from inflammatory pathways activation. Despite ongoing administration of HCQ in a wide spectrum of disorders, there are some reports about several side effects, especially retinopathy in some patients treated with HCQ. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and its isoforms are the main metabolizers of HCQ and CQ. Pharmacokinetic properties of CYP enzymes are influenced by CYP polymorphism, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation. Accumulating evidence about side effects of HCQ in some patients raise the possibility that different response of patients to HCQ might be due to difference in their genome. Therefore, CYP450 genotyping especially for CYP2D6 might be helpful to refine HCQ dosage. Also, regular control of retina should be considered for patients under HCQ treatment. The major focus of the present review is to discuss about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of CQ and HCQ that may be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, and consequently cause several side effects especially retinopathy during SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","output":"Molecular effects and retinopathy induced by hydroxychloroquine during SARS-CoV-2 therapy: Role of CYP450 isoforms and epigenetic modulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Although euthanasia in the context of adult psychiatry is legalized in Belgium, it poses major ethical and clinical challenges for the health care professionals and volunteers involved.

For two out\\\\of\\\\facility individual differentiated service delivery (DSD) models, we assessed acceptability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) distribution through private pharmacies and reach of home delivery of ART through courier services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Botswana. METHODS: From 24 July to 24 August 2020, we conducted exit interviews with PLHIV receiving ART from 10 high\\\\volume public facilities in Gaborone, and mapped and conducted an online survey with private pharmacies to assess willingness and capacity to dispense ART to PLHIV enrolled in the Botswana national ART program. We piloted ART home delivery from September 2020 to January 2021 in Gaborone and Kweneng East districts for PLHIV accessing ART at two Tebelopele Wellness Clinics. We used cascade analysis to measure the enrolment and eventual reach (percentage of those reached amongst those who are eligible) of ART home delivery. RESULTS: Sixty\\\\one PLHIV and 42 private pharmacies participated. Of the PLHIV interviewed, 37 (61%) indicated willingness to access ART from private pharmacies and pay BWP50 (US$4) per refill for a maximum of two refills per year. All private pharmacies surveyed were willing to provide ART, and 26 (62%) would charge a dispensing fee (range = BWP50C100; US$4C8) per refill. All pharmacies operated 12 h/day, 6 days/week and on public holidays. In the home delivery pilot, 650 PLHIV were due for refills, 69.5% (n = 452) of whom were eligible for home delivery. Of these, 361 were successfully offered home delivery and 303 enrolled (enrolment = 83.9%: female = 87.2%, male = 77.8%, p = 0.013). A total of 276 deliveries were made, a reach of 61%. CONCLUSIONS: Providing ART through private pharmacies and home delivery was acceptable in Botswana during COVID\\\\19. Surveyed pharmacies were willing and able to dispense ART to PLHIV attending public sector facilities for free or for a nominal fee. Additionally, using courier services for ART home delivery is a novel and viable model in countries with a reliable courier service like Botswana and should be scaled up, particularly in urban areas.","output":"Distribution of antiretroviral therapy through private pharmacies and postal courier services during COVID\\\\19 in Botswana: acceptability and reach of two out\\\\of\\\\facility individual differentiated service delivery models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Azerbaijan is an upper middle-income country in South Caucasus with an area of 86,600 km(2) and a total population of 10 million people and gross domestic product of US $4480 per capita. The aim of this research is to estimate fungal infection burden and highlight the problem at national and international levels. METHODS: Fungal infection burden was estimated using data from epidemiological papers and population at risk and LIFE (Leading International Fungal Education) modelling. RESULTS: The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in 2018 was 6193, 29% of them not receiving antiretroviral therapy. Based on 90% and 20% rates of oral and oesophageal candidiasis in patients with CD4 cell count <200 l(C1) we estimate 808 and 579 patients with oral and oesophageal candidiasis, respectively. The annual incidences of cryptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia are 5 and 55 cases, respectively. We estimated 2307 cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), 4927 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and 6504 with severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS). Using data on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), lung cancer, acute myeloid leukaemia rates, and number of transplantations, we estimated 693 cases of invasive aspergillosis following these conditions. Using a low-European rate for invasive candidiasis, we estimated 499 and 75 patients with candidemia and intra-abdominal candidiasis respectively. The number of adult women (15C55 years) in Azerbaijan is ~2,658,000, so it was estimated that 159,490 women suffer from recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (rVVC). DISCUSSION: In total, the estimated number of people suffering from fungal diseases in Azerbaijan is 225,974 (2.3% of the population). However, the fungal rate is underestimated due to lack of epidemiological data. The most imminent need is improvement in diagnostic capabilities. This aim should be achieved via establishing a reference laboratory and equipping major clinical centers with essential diagnostics assays.","output":"The burden of serious fungal infections in Azerbaijan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychotherapists accelerated their adoption of telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 outbreak to accommodate preventative isolation and social distancing. Lessons from psychotherapist experiences with technology prior to the outbreak can offer recommendations for practitioners and professional regulators. In this study, psychotherapists were interviewed about their use of technology in practice and interviews were analyzed for consistency with current literature on usual practice and professional regulations. The researchers used actor-network theory to map and explore the links and themes that emerged from the research. We found that technology use was more integrated with psychotherapy practice and psychotherapists were more confident and comfortable with telepsychotherapy than the literature predicted. Key themes arising from the interviews were psychotherapist responsibility and trust that included expanded psychotherapist responsibility, client trust, psychotherapists' self-trust, and trust of information sources. Telepsychotherapy can be enhanced by reflective, intentional practice, making space to examine routine behaviors, and developing strategies to counteract the unreliability of technology. Further, professional and regulatory bodies can support effective practice by developing clear and achievable technological competence responsibilities and by integrating technology training with mandatory psychotherapy education.","output":"Psychotherapist experiences with telepsychotherapy: Pre COVID-19 lessons for a post COVID-19 world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The macro-linkage relating to Government budget balance has been concerned by worldwide researchers and whether there is a causal relation between budget balance and macroeconomic stability. Vietnam is one of emerging countries so that the management of economy is always concerned by government. Using the Vector AutoRegression (VAR) approach combined with the Granger causality test, the paper has demonstrated a causal relation between budget balance and macroeconomic stability measured by inflation and economic growth rate in Vietnam from 1995 to 2020. Moreover, the techniques of Impulse Response Function (IRF) analysis and decomposition of variance of variables (FEVD) in the VAR model provide evidence of the budget balances impact on inflation and growth rate in the short term. However, the relationship between budget balance and inflation is negative, while the figure for economic development has an opposite trend. Besides, it is indicated that Government budget balance explains 3.95% of inflation and 21.66% of economic development in Vietnam. These effects have fluctuated slightly and extended for more later periods. From that, the study summarizes several policy implications associated with budget balance mainly about cost savings and increasing income of Government. These suggestions might contribute to stabilizing inflation and economic growth in the context that the Government is undertaking a lot of spending tasks to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. ? 2022, Economic Laboratory for Transition Research.

Vaccination appears to offer the way out of this pandemic. Vaccines against this virus make use of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, an essential protein on the surface of the virus that it uses to attach itself to the host cells. In viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson) the gene for the spike protein is introduced into an adenovirus. Following vaccination, the modified adenovirus will infect cells of the host, which will subsequently start to produce the spike protein, causing an immune response. RNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) only introduce messenger RNA for the spike protein into host cells, which the messenger RNA uses to produce spike protein. Viral vector vaccines and RNA vaccines are not only faster to develop and safer to produce than traditional vaccines, they are also easier to modify to new viruses and virus variants.

Objectives: To investigate whether treatment with RTX is associated with severe infection and death. Methods: We performed an observational, multicenter, French national cohort study querying the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, including highly suspected/ confirmed iRMD-COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was to assess the severity rate of COVID-19. Severe disease was defined by hospitalization in intensive care unit or death. The secondary objectives were to analyze death rate and length of hospital stay. Two control groups were considered for comparison with RTX treated patients: a first group including all non-RTX treated iRMD patients and a second consisting on RTX untreated iRMD patients with diseases for which RTX is a recognized therapeutic option. Adjusting on potential confounding factors was performed by using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score method. Results: We collected a total of 1090 records. Patients were mainly females (67.3%, 734/1090) with a mean age of 55.216.4 years, and 51.1% (557/1090) were over the age of 55. Almost 70% of the population had at least one comorbidity (756/1090). A total of 63 patients were treated with RTX, mainly for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (31/63, 49.2%). RTX treated patients were more likely to be males, with older age, higher prevalence of comorbidities and corticosteroid use. The control population consisted on 1027 non-RTX treated iRMD patients, and 495 RTX untreated iRMD patients with diseases for which RTX is a recognized therapeutic option. Of the 1,090 patients, 137 developed severe disease (12.6%). After adjusting on potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure and the underlying disease), severe disease was confirmed to be observed more frequently in patients receiving RTX compared to all RTX untreated iRMD patients (effect size, ES 3.26, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.66 to 6.40, p<0.001) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (ES 2.62, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.09, p=0.005). Patients who developed a severe disease had a more recent rituximab infusion compared to patients with mild or moderate disease. Indeed, the time between the last infusion of rituximab and the first symptoms of COVID-19 was significantly shorter in patients who developed a severe form of COVID-19 (Figure 1). Eighty-nine patients in our cohort died, resulting in an overall death rate of 8.2%. Death rate was numerically higher in RTX treated patients (13/63, 20.6%) compared to all RTX untreated iRMDs patients (76/1027, 7.4%) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (49/495, 9.9%). After considering the previously described confounding factors, the risk of death was not significantly increased in patients treated with RTX compared to all RTX untreated iRMDs patients (ES 1.32, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.19, p=0.53) (Table 2) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (ES 1.48, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.20, p=0.32). In line with a more severe COVID-19 disease, the length of hospital stay was markedly longer in patients treated with RTX compared to both untreated RTX patient groups. Conclusion: RTX therapy is associated with a more severe COVID-19 infection. RTX will have to be applied with particular caution in patients with iRMDs.","output":"Outcome of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic and inflammatory diseases treated with rituximab: Data from De french rmd COVID-19 cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personalized medicine is emerging as a new goal in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

SUMMARY ANSWER: MAR services, and hence treatments for infertile couples, were stopped in most European countries for a mean of 7 weeks. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: With the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, non-urgent medical care was reduced by local authorities to preserve health resources and maintain social distancing. Furthermore, ESHRE and other societies recommended to postpone ART pregnancies as of 14 March 2020. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: A structured questionnaire was distributed in April among the ESHRE Committee of National Representatives, followed by further information collection through email. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: The information was collected through the questionnaire and afterwards summarised and aligned with data from the European Centre for Disease Control on the number of COVID-19 cases per country. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: By aligning the data for each country with respective epidemiological data, we show a large variation in the time and the phase in the epidemic in the curve when MAR/ART treatments were suspended and restarted. Similarly, the duration of interruption varied. Fertility preservation treatments and patient supportive care for patients remained available during the pandemic. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data collection was prone to misinterpretation of the questions and replies, and required further follow-up to check the accuracy. Some representatives reported that they, themselves, were not always aware of the situation throughout the country or reported difficulties with providing single generalised replies, for instance when there were regional differences within their country. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The current article provides a basis for further research of the different strategies developed in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Such conclusions will be invaluable for health authorities and healthcare professionals with respect to future similar situations.

The USDA granted multiple waivers to allow flexibility in WIC operations during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to hear from WIC participants about the impact of changes due to COVID-19. METHODS: In the summer of 2020, 60 semi-structured interviews were completed, half with English-speaking and half with Spanish-speaking WIC participants in the Los Angeles area. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a deductive content analysis approach to describe responses and identify themes. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: 1) The pandemic has exacerbated the ckhallenges facing low-income families; 2) WIC continues to be a valued resource especially under the challenging circumstances; 3) WIC's transition to remote service delivery has ensured that families continue to receive not only critical WIC food benefits, but also nutrition education and support; 4) Lessons learned during COVID-19 can inform needed WIC modernizations to maximize WIC's proven benefits post-pandemic. Nearly 75% of WIC participants faced reductions in income due to job loss or reduced work hours. Nearly 60% of households reported experiencing food insecurity. Early in the pandemic, many reported challenges accessing WIC-eligible foods, resulting in lost food benefits. Approximately 43% reported getting food from a food pantry or church, with most (77%) reporting first time usage. Participants shared that even with the change to only remote education, they valued the information and were very satisfied with WIC services. The majority (83%) found the California WIC App helpful in informing what WIC foods they could purchase. Participants also reported that enrolling in WIC remotely was easier than coming in-person and they were comfortable providing documents related to income and eligibility determination remotely. CONCLUSIONS: WIC has been essential in helping families cope with COVID. WIC's transition to remote service delivery has ensured seamless and safe delivery of services, helping families with young children during an unprecedented time of need.

However, particular specifications for exceptional cases, such as children with minor parents are missing. This study aimed to examine the level of transparency regarding recruitment and informed consent approaches in publications of clinical trials recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa. We thereby focused particularly on the transparency about consenting persons (i.e. proxy decision-makers) and assessed the need to expand reporting guidelines for such exceptional cases. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of clinical trial publications previously identified through a systematic review. Multiple scientific databases were searched up to March 2019. Clinical trial publications addressing consent and potentially recruiting children with minor parents in sub-Saharan Africa were included. 44 of the in total 4382 screened articles met our inclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the included articles provided full evidence on whether any recruited children had minor parents and how consent was obtained for them. Four proxy decision-maker types were identified (parents; parents or guardians; guardians; or caregivers), with further descriptions provided rarely and mostly in referenced clinical trial registrations or protocols. Also, terminology describing proxy decision-makers was often used inconsistently. CONCLUSIONS: Reporting the minimum maternal age alongside maternal data provided in baseline demographics can increase transparency on the recruitment of children with minor mothers. The CONSORT checklist should require clinical trial publications to state or reference exceptional informed consent procedures applied for special population groups. A standardized definition of proxy decision-maker types in international clinical trial guidelines would facilitate correct and transparent informed consent for children and children with minor parents.

Our project aimed to provide an optimised surge rota at East Sussex Healthcare Trust during the second Covid-19 surge to improve workforce experience and to allow us to prepare for future surges while ensuring patient safety.MethodsA novel surge rota was developed alongside a diverse group of representatives with backgrounds in medical education, hospital management and general medicine. The new rota was more flexible and built on the regular 2016 Junior Doctor contract with the addition of supportive staffing and environmental changes. These included a variety of changes informed by the previous discussions regarding the rota used during the first surge. Improvement was measured during feedback sessions with individual doctors. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative questionnaire data was gathered and analysed using descriptive statistics for presentation and summary.ResultsOur results suggest the novel surge rota was an improvement upon other rotas used during the first Covid-19 surge. The main factors that affected this were: more senior and specialist support, timely consultant assessment of newly admitted patients, and extra locum cover. The novel rota facilitated more flexible workforce distribution, translating into improved overall junior doctor wellbeing throughout the surge.ConclusionsThe identified rota tactics are recommended for future disruption and more can be understood on this topic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOV-2019) has created mass panic in China due to its highly contagious by contact and aerosols and lack of effective treatment. However, the emotion status of migraineurs stayed unclear during the nCOV-2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To understand psychological distress of migraineurs by comparing with common population and identify potential high-risk factors of severe psychological distress among migraine patients. METHOD: We enrolled the migraineurs treated at the department of Neurology of West China Hospital and healthy controls with age- and sex-matched to migraineurs. Data on clinicodemographics and psychological distress in the month of February 2020 (during in the nCOV-2019 outbreak in China) were collected. We used the Kessler 6-item (K-6) scale to assess psychological distress. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The 144 migraineurs and 150 controls were included in the study. Migraineurs showed significantly higher K-6 scores than controls (P < 0.001). Migraine attack frequency in previous 30 days and time spent paying attention to outbreak showed significant in multivariate logistic regression with respective odds ratios of 2.225 (95%CI 1.361-3.628, P = 0.001) and 1.589 (95% 1.117-2.26, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: During public health outbreaks, healthcare professionals should focus not only on controlling and reducing migraine attack but also on mental health of migraineurs, especially those with high frequency migraine attack.","output":"The status and high risk factors of severe psychological distress in migraine patients during nCOV-2019 outbreak in Southwest China: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple enveloped RNA viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae, like measles virus (MeV), Nipah virus (NiV), canine distemper virus (CDV), or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are of high clinical relevance. Each year a huge number of lives are lost as a result of these viral infections. Worldwide, MeV infection alone is responsible for over a hundred thousand deaths each year despite available vaccine. Therefore, there is an urgent need for treatment options to counteract these viral infections. The development of antiviral drugs in general stands as a huge challenge due to the rapid emergence of viral escape mutants. Here, we disclose the discovery of a small-molecule antiviral, compound 1 (ZHAWOC9045), active against several pneumo-/paramyxoviruses, including MeV, NiV, CDV, RSV, and parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV-5). A series of mechanistic characterizations revealed that compound 1 targets a host factor which is indispensable for viral genome replication. Drug resistance profiling against a paramyxovirus model (CDV) demonstrated no detectable adaptation despite prolonged time of investigation, thereby mitigating the rapid emergence of escape variants. Furthermore, a thorough structure-activity relationship analysis of compound 1 led to the invention of 100-times-more potent-derivatives, e.g., compound 2 (ZHAWOC21026).

METHODS: A multimodality CIM treatment intervention was provided by integrative practitioners to HCPs in three isolated COVID-19 departments. HCPs two main concerns were scored (from 0 to 6) before and following the CIM intervention using the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing questionnaire. Postintervention narratives identified reflective narratives specifying emotional and/or spiritual keywords. RESULTS: Of 181 HCPs undergoing at least one CIM treatment, 119 (65.7%) completed post-treatment questionnaires. While HCPs listing baseline emotional-related concerns benefited from the CIM intervention, those who did not express emotional or spiritual concerns improved even more significantly following the first session, for both leading concerns (p=0.038) and emotional-related concerns (p=0.023). Nevertheless, it was shown that following subsequent treatments HCPs who expressed emotional and spiritual concerns improved more significantly than those who did not for emotional-related concerns (p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: A CIM intervention for front-line HCPs working in isolated COVID-19 departments can significantly impact emotional-related concerns, more so after the first treatment and among HCPs not using emotional-spiritual keywords in post-treatment narratives. Referral of HCPs to CIM programmes for improved well-being should avoid referral bias to those not expressing emotional/spiritual concerns.","output":"Complementary and integrative medicine intervention in front-line COVID-19 clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This month, Helen Eftekhari, BANCC Secretary, looks at the current COVID-19 crisis and its impact on cardiovascular care","output":"Nursing, COVID-19 and cardiovascular care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the ensuing cardiac and cerebral injuries contribute to the poor outcome of cardiac arrest (CA) victims, in which the pathogenetic process is possibly driven by cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be a promising strategy for post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral protection in rat, but its effectiveness in the clinically relevant swine model and the potential protective mechanism remain unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether MSCs administration could alleviate post-resuscitation cardiac and cerebral injuries through the inhibition of cell pyroptosis and ferroptosis in swine. Twenty-four male domestic swine were randomly divided into three groups: sham, CPR, and MSC. A dose of 2.510(6)/kg of MSCs derived from human embryonic stem cells was intravenously infused at 1.5, and 3 days prior to CA. The animal model was established by 8 min of CA and then 8 min of CPR. After resuscitation, cardiac, cerebral function and injury biomarkers were regularly evaluated for a total of 24 h. At 24 h post-resuscitation, pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-18), ferroptosis-related proteins (ACSL4, GPX4) and iron deposition in the heart, cortex and hippocampus were measured. Consequently, significantly greater cardiac, cerebral dysfunction and injuries after resuscitation were observed in the CPR and MSC groups compared with the sham group. However, the severity of cardiac and cerebral damage were significantly milder in the MSC group than in the CPR group. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD and ACSL4, the contents of IL-1 and IL-18, and the level of iron deposition were significantly higher while the expression level of GPX4 was significantly lower in the heart, cortex and hippocampus in all resuscitated animals compared with the sham group. Nevertheless, MSCs administration significantly decreased post-resuscitation cardiac, cerebral pyroptosis and ferroptosis compared to the CPR group.

Methods: We first sought to estimate the vertical transmission rate of congenital CMV infection in twins by gathering cohort-based studies of congenital CMV in which vertical transmission in both singleton and twin pregnancies was reported. This also allowed us to compare singleton and twin infection rates. From the above studies and other large cohorts of congenitally infected infants, the percentage of discordantly infected twin pairs determined whether this is a rare phenomenon. Theorizing discordance is not rare, we then analyzed data from cases with twin outcomes for congenital CMV infection, according to whether the twins were monozygotic or dizygotic, and calculated their corresponding concordance rates to estimate the broad-sense heritability. Lastly, we described other factors that might affect vertical transmission. Results: From five articles following at-risk pregnancies, the rate of vertical transmission in twin pregnancies is 58.7% (95% CI 43.3-72.3%) whereas in singleton pregnancies it is 31.4% (95% CI: 29.0-34.0%) p = 0.0002. Of ten studies of larger cohorts of infants with congenital CMV infection, 21 of 42 twin pairs with at least one twin infected were discordant for congenital CMV (50.0%, 95% CI: 34.4-65.6%) indicating discordance of congenital CMV infection in twin pairs is not rare. Of 28 studies covering 37 twin pairs where at least one twin had congenital CMV, and zygosity was known, eleven of thirteen monozygotic twin pairs (84.6%; 95% CI: 53.7-97.3%) were concordant for CMV infection, and nine of twenty-four dizygotic twin pairs (37.5%; 95% CI: 19.6-59.2%) were concordant for infection giving an estimated hereditability of 94.2%. Within these 37 twin pairs, factors such as primary or recurrent maternal infection, prematurity, growth discordance, and sex are described; however, in many of these cases these factors are unknown. Conclusion: The rate of vertical transmission of congenital CMV is higher for twins than singletons.

Design/methodology/approach This study scrapes a sample of tweets communicated by major global listed firms between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 and identifies disclosures that mention firm engagement in stakeholder-oriented actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between firms' social performance and the number of tweets they post about stakeholder-oriented COVID-19 actions. Further, firms' financial resilience is examined as a moderating factor of this relationship. Findings The results show that firms with better social performance are more likely to engage in and, hence, communicate stakeholder-oriented actions for the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. Moreover, it is evident that firms with better social performance communicate more stakeholder-oriented actions only when they belong to industries that have not been severely impacted by the pandemic. Originality/value This study has two important contributions. First, this study provides contemporary evidence of corporate disclosure of firms and their stakeholder-oriented actions on Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the initial outbreak period.

METHODS: An emulator of a CBCT\\\\based online ART system was used to simulate more than 300 treatments for 13 cervical and 15 rectal cancer patients. CBCT images were used to generate adaptive replans. To measure clinical resource cost, the six phases of the workflow were timed. To evaluate the dosimetric benefit, changes in dosimetric values were assessed. These included minimum dose (Dmin) and volume receiving 95% of prescription (V95%) for the planning target volume (PTV) and the clinical target volume (CTV), and maximum 2 cc's (D2cc) of the bladder, bowel, rectum, and sigmoid colon. RESULTS: The average duration of the workflow was 24.4 and 9.2 min for cervical and rectal cancer patients, respectively. A large proportion of time was dedicated to editing target contours (13.1 and 2.7 min, respectively). For cervical cancer patients, the replan changed the Dmin to the PTVs and CTVs for each fraction 0.25 and 0.25 Gy, respectively. The replan changed the V95% by 9.2 and 7.9%. The D2cc to the bladder, bowel, rectum, and sigmoid colon for each fraction changed ?0.02, ?0.08, ?0.07, and ?0.04 Gy, respectively.

But it remains unclear how individual contact patterns interact with the infectious and non-infectious stages through which a disease progresses over time. Here, we investigate this interplay of contact patterns and disease progression using real-world physical proximity data from the Copenhagen Networks Study. We find from the data that the number of encounters following a potential infection event varies significantly over time -- with clear daily and weekly variations of encounter probability. These variations can accelerate or slow down the spread of infectious diseases, depending on how they are aligned with the infectious periods. Remarkably, the resulting resonance strongly depends on the latent period, which, although non-infectious and often neglected, is key to the degree of alignment of the infectious period with the weekly modulation. We demonstrate that the resonance effect can be reproduced by a generative process with a time-dependent encounter rate that reflects the daily and weekly modulation found in the data. Including this non-Markovian generative process into a well-mixed, mean-field spreading model, we show that resonances between contact patterns and disease progression can change the basic reproduction number considerably -- in our case by up to 20%. Surprisingly, a change in latent period can thereby make epidemic spread stronger even if the individual infectiousness is unaltered.","output":"Resonance between contact patterns and disease progression shapes epidemic spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mens Sheds are a community-based health promotion concept which brings men together to engage in joint activities.

Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Following the convergent integrated approach, quantitative data were transformed and merged with qualitative data to conduct a thematic analysis. Overall, 35 qualitative, nine quantitative, and eight mixed-methods studies were included. We found evidence regarding benefits of shed participation on self-rated health, social isolation, and well-being. We identified three key characteristics of a successful Mens Shed, including appropriate shed facilities, sufficient funding as well as a participant-driven management and organization of the shed.

Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence analysis, and electroretinograms of the eyes were then performed to assess ocular changes, and enzyme-linked immunospot assays and intracellular staining of single-cell suspensions of the spleens were used to detect immune changes during an 8 week observation period. RESULTS: Neutrophils were the main inflammatory infiltrating cells appearing at the anterior chamber. No cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ labeled T cells, F4/80+ labeled macrophages, or CD56+ labeled natural killer cells were found in the vitreal cavities or retinas in dispase-injected mice within 5 days after injection.

Nonetheless, the significant short and long-term impacts of prolonged suspension of in-person classes is a major concern. There is still considerable debate around the best timing for school closure and reopening, its impact on the dynamics of disease transmission, and its effectiveness when considered in association with other mitigation measures. Despite the erratic implementation of mitigation measures in Brazil, school closures were among the first measures taken early in the pandemic in most of the 27 states in the country. Further, Brazil delayed the reopening of schools and stands among the countries in which schools remained closed for the most prolonged period in 2020. To assess the impact of school reopening and the effect of contact tracing strategies in rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, we model the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission in 3 large urban centers in Brazil under different epidemiological contexts. We implement an extended SEIR model stratified by age and considering contact networks in different settings - school, home, work, and elsewhere, in which the infection transmission rate is affected by various intervention measures. After fitting epidemiological and demographic data, we simulate scenarios with increasing school transmission due to school reopening. Our model shows that reopening schools results in a non-linear increase of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, which is highly dependent on infection and disease incidence at the time of reopening. While low rates of within-school transmission resulted in small effects on disease incidence (cases/100,000 pop), intermediate or high rates can severely impact disease trends resulting in escalating rates of new cases even if other interventions remain unchanged. When contact tracing and quarantining are restricted to school and home settings, a large number of daily tests is required to produce significant effects of reducing the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Our results suggest that policymakers should carefully consider the epidemiological context and timing regarding the implementation of school closure and return of in-person school activities. Also, although contact tracing strategies are essential to prevent new infections and outbreaks within school environments, our data suggest that they are alone not sufficient to avoid significant impacts on community transmission in the context of school reopening in settings with high and sustained transmission rates.","output":"Modeling the impact of school reopening and contact tracing strategies on Covid-19 dynamics in different epidemiologic settings in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Telephone-based digital triage is widely used by services that provide urgent care. This involves a call handler or clinician using a digital triage tool to generate algorithm-based care advice, based on a patient's symptoms. Advice typically takes the form of signposting within defined levels of urgency to specific services or self-care advice. Despite wide adoption, there is limited evaluation of its impact on service user experience, service use and clinical outcomes; no previous systematic reviews have focussed on services that utilise digital triage, and its impact on these outcome areas within urgent care. This review aims to address this need, particularly now that telephone-based digital triage is well established in healthcare delivery. METHODS Studies assessing the impact of telephone-based digital triage on service user experience, health care service use and clinical outcomes will be identified through searches conducted in Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science and Scopus. Search terms using words relating to digital triage and urgent care settings (excluding in-hours general practice) will be used. The review will include all original study types including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies; studies published in the last 20 years and studies published in English. Quality assessment of studies will be conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT); a narrative synthesis approach will be used to analyse and summarise findings. DISCUSSION This is the first systematic review to evaluate service user experience, service use and clinical outcomes related to the use of telephone-based digital triage in urgent care settings. It will evaluate evidence from studies of wide-ranging designs. The narrative synthesis approach will enable the integration of findings to provide new insights on service delivery.

The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infectivity.

Besides envenomation, drug overdose and poison ingestion can occur at any time, either deliberately or accidentally, possibly ending in fatalities. To date, they have been little research done to design and discover antidotes despite their paramount relevance to society. In light of this reality, medicinal chemists, biochemists, and other scientists involved in the drug development and discovery pipeline have to give significant attention to the development of appropriate antidotes and antivenoms that will have a large extent of effectiveness against the overdosed drug or the poisons. The process may start from a library of phytocompounds, synthetic compounds, de novo compounds on the bench, or antivenom development from antibodies of appropriate animal models. It is therefore important for military research and development units to work hand in hand with the academia and the pharmaceutical industry so that antidotes and antivenoms can be developed faster and be readily available for fieldwork and for civilian hospitals at all times. The recent advances in technology in the pharmaceutical industry have provided an easier and cheaper route to design and discover new medicines through computer-aided drug discovery (CAAD).

It is very essential to identify the contaminated patients of COVID-19 as early as possible and keep them in isolation. The technique that uses radiology images to detect the patients is very fast and promising. Generally the patients infected with COVID-19 disease have some abnormalities in their chest images. Thus, there is a possible use of deep learning models in the identification of the disease from the radiology images. This article also uses some learning algorithms to detect the diseased patients from their chest X-ray images. A dataset of 900 chest X-rays was prepared from the databases that widely exist. Three popular convolutional neural networks like ResNet, GoogleNet, and AlexNet were individually used to extract useful features from the chest X-ray images (CXR) to train the classifiers for identifying the COVID-19 disease with greater accuracy.

This is well realized in the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a natural line of defense in many organisms, especially insects which survive in extreme niches. Here we identified AMPs from red spotted apollo butterflies found at high altitudes in Russia, China, and Korea. The larval development stage occurs on the months of December to April, when there are very low temperatures. The insects natural defense mechanism might contribute to withstand this condition, which is our point of interest, and we utilized the genomic information to identify AMPs from red spotted butterflies. The obtained AMPs were tested against a list of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Finally, we obtained one promising candidate active against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a causative organism for periodontitis. With further validations, this could be a lead antimicrobial agent in future. ABSTRACT: Classical antibiotics are the foremost treatment strategy against microbial infections. Overuse of this has led to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural defense elements present across many species including humans, insects, bacteria, and plants. Insect AMPs are our area of interest, because of their stronger abilities in host defense. We have deciphered AMPs from an endangered species Parnassius bremeri, commonly known as the red spotted apollo butterfly. It belongs to the second largest insect order Lepidoptera, comprised of butterflies and moths, and lives in the high altitudes of Russia, China, and Korea. We aimed at identifying the AMPs from the larvae stages. The rationale of choosing this stage is that the P. bremeri larvae development occurs at extremely low temperature conditions, which might serve as external stimuli for AMP production. RNA was isolated from larvae (L1 to L5) instar stages and subjected to next generation sequencing. The transcriptomes obtained were curated in in-silico pipelines. The peptides obtained were screened for requisite AMP physicochemical properties and in vitro antimicrobial activity. With the sequential screening and validation, we obtained fifteen candidate AMPs. One peptide TPSC032 showed promising antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary causative organism of periodontitis.","output":"Utilizing Red Spotted Apollo Butterfly Transcriptome to Identify Antimicrobial Peptide Candidates against Porphyromonas gingivalis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helicases are versatile NTP-dependent motor proteins of monophyletic origin that are found in all kingdoms of life. Their functions range from nucleic acid duplex unwinding to protein displacement and double-strand translocation. This explains their participation in virtually every metabolic process that involves nucleic acids, including DNA replication, recombination and repair, transcription, translation, as well as RNA processing. Helicases are encoded by all plant and animal viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome that is larger than 7 kb, indicating a link to genome size evolution in this virus class. Viral helicases belong to three out of the six currently recognized superfamilies, SF1, SF2, and SF3. Despite being omnipresent, highly conserved and essential, only a few viral helicases, mostly from SF2, have been studied extensively. In general, their specific roles in the viral replication cycle remain poorly understood at present. The SF1 helicase protein of viruses classified in the order Nidovirales is encoded in replicase open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), which is translated to give rise to a large polyprotein following a ribosomal frameshift from the upstream ORF1a. Proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein yields a dozen or so mature proteins, one of which includes a helicase. Its hallmark is the presence of an N-terminal multi-nuclear zinc-binding domain, the nidoviral genetic marker and one of the most conserved domains across members of the order. This review summarizes biochemical, structural, and genetic data, including drug development studies, obtained using helicases originating from several mammalian nidoviruses, along with the results of the genomics characterization of a much larger number of (putative) helicases of vertebrate and invertebrate nidoviruses. In the context of our knowledge of related helicases of cellular and viral origin, it discusses the implications of these results for the protein's emerging critical function(s) in nidovirus evolution, genome replication and expression, virion biogenesis, and possibly also post-transcriptional processing of viral RNAs. Using our accumulated knowledge and highlighting gaps in our data, concepts and approaches, it concludes with a perspective on future research aimed at elucidating the role of helicases in the nidovirus replication cycle.","output":"What we know but do not understand about nidovirus helicases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endurance exercise is a potent intervention with widespread benefits proven to reduce disease incidence and impact across species. While endurance exercise supports neural plasticity, enhanced memory, and reduced neurodegeneration, less is known about the effect of chronic exercise on the progression of movement disorders such as ataxias. Here, we focused on three different types of ataxias, Spinocerebellar Ataxias Type (SCAs) 2, 3, and 6, belonging to the polyglutamine (polyQ) family of neurodegenerative disorders. In Drosophila models of these SCAs, flies progressively lose motor function. In this study, we observe marked protection of speed and endurance in exercised SCA2 flies and modest protection in exercised SCA6 models, with no benefit to SCA3 flies. Causative protein levels are reduced in SCA2 flies after chronic exercise, but not in SCA3 models, linking protein levels to exercise-based benefits. Further mechanistic investigation indicates that the exercise-inducible protein, Sestrin (Sesn), suppresses mobility decline and improves early death in SCA2 flies, even without exercise, coincident with disease protein level reduction and increased autophagic flux. These improvements depend on previously established functions of Sesn that reduce oxidative damage and modulate mTOR activity. Our study suggests differential responses of polyQ SCAs to exercise, highlighting the potential for more extensive application of exercise-based therapies in the prevention of polyQ neurodegeneration. Defining the mechanisms by which endurance exercise suppresses polyQ SCAs will open the door for more effective treatment for these diseases.","output":"Endurance exercise ameliorates phenotypes in Drosophila models of Spinocerebellar Ataxias."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome and is linked with systemic inflammation. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are known to play a role in the pathology of NE by activating innate immune cells. Methods: Eighty-seven infants were enrolled including 53 infants with NE of whom 52 received therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and 34 term infant healthy controls (TC). Whole blood sampling was performed in the first 4 days of life, and a 14-spot ELISA Multiplex Cytokine Array was carried out on baseline samples or after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an additional inflammatory stimulus. The cytokine medians were examined for differences between infants with NE and healthy TC; and then short-term outcomes of Sarnat stage, seizures, and MRI brain were examined within the NE group. The potential of LPS stimulation to predict abnormal MRI was explored using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: At baseline, infants with NE had significantly higher levels of erythropoietin (Epo), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1ra and significantly lower vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than had controls. All cytokines were increased after LPS stimulation in infants with NE with an excessive Epo and IL-1ra response than in controls. Infants with NE had lower IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), VEGF, and interferon (IFN)- than controls had following LPS. GM-CSF and IFN-, IL-1, IL-1ra, and VEGF were higher on days 1C2 in NE infants with abnormal neuroimaging. GM-CSF, IFN-, and TNF- levels with LPS stimulation were different upon stimulation between normal and abnormal neuroimaging. TNF- is the only strong cytokine predictor both pre- and post-LPS stimulation of abnormal brain imaging. Conclusions: Altered cytokine responses are found in infants with NE vs. controls, and more significant differences are unmasked by the additional stimulus of LPS, which potentially improves the predictive power of these cytokines for the detection of abnormal MRIs. Infants with NE undergoing TH demonstrate both trained immunity and tolerance, and understanding these responses will facilitate adjunctive immunomodulatory treatments.","output":"Altered Cytokine Endotoxin Responses in Neonatal Encephalopathy Predict MRI Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Recent localized surges in COVID-19 cases have resulted in the hospitals serving those areas being overwhelmed. In such cases, the ability to rapidly and objectively determine a patient's acuity and predict near-term care needs is a major challenge. At issue is the clinician's ability to correctly identify patients at risk for subsequent rapid clinical deterioration. Data-driven tools that can support such determinations in real-time may be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgement during COVID-19 surges. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Rothman Index (RI) predictive model in distinguishing the risk of subsequent deterioration or elevated care needs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We evaluated the initial RI score on admission to predict COVID-19 patient risk for 216 COVID-19 patients discharged from March 21st to June 7th, 2020 at Sinai LifeBridge Hospital and 1,453 COVID-19 patients discharged from any of Yale New Haven Health System's Yale New Haven, Bridgeport, and Greenwich hospitals from April 1st to April 28th, 2020. In-hospital mortality as a function of age and RI on admission for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were compared. AUC values using each COVID-19 patient's initial RI on admission to predict in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU utilization were computed, as were precision and recall for mortality prediction at specific RI thresholds. Results: The RI computed at the time of admission provides a high degree of objective discrimination to differentiate the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations at the outset of hospitalization. The high risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 20-30% of the COVID-19 positive population with mortality rates from 40-50%. The low risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 40%-55% of the population with mortality rates ranging from 1%-8%. Of note is that COVID-19 patients who present with heightened but generally unremarkable acuity can be identified early as having considerably elevated risk for subsequent physiological deterioration. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated mortality rates compared to non-COVID-19 medical service patients and may be subject to rapid deterioration following hospital admission. A lack of predictive indicators for identifying patients at high risk of subsequent deterioration or death can pose a challenge to clinicians. The RI has excellent performance characteristics when stratifying risk among COVID-19 patients at the time of admission. The RI can assist clinicians in real-time with a high degree of objective discrimination by segmenting the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations. This supports rapid and optimal patient bed assignment and resource allocation.","output":"Identification on Admission of COVID-19 Patients at Risk of Subsequent Rapid Clinical Deterioration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of this study was to examine differences in worry, loneliness, and mental health between those individuals infected by COVID-19 or having someone their family infected, and the rest of the population. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA, and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness, and mental health) in both groups. Results: Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p < 0.05) and their family members (p < 0.001) and had poorer mental health (p < 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of education, yet with small effect sizes. Conclusions: In view of the small differences between those with and without infection, we generally conclude that the mental health effects of the COVID-19 situation are not limited to those who have been infected or have had an infection within the family but extend to the wider population.","output":"Cross-National Study of Worrying, Loneliness, and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison between Individuals with and without Infection in the Family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis is an important global health problem that not only affects social interaction and physical and mental health but also causes economic burden. Health problems or distress caused by dermatitis may be easily overlooked, and relevant epidemiological data are limited. Therefore, a better understanding of the burden of dermatitis is necessary for developing global intervention strategies. METHODS: All data on dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis (AD), contact dermatitis (CD) and seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD), were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 (GBD2019) database. The extracted age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rates (ASDR) data were analysed by stratification, including by sex, country or region, and sociodemographic index (SDI) indicators. Finally, we analysed the correlation between the global burden of dermatitis and socioeconomic development status. RESULTS: According to the GBD 2019 estimate, the ASIR and ASDR for the three major types of dermatitis in 2019 were 5244.3988 (95% CI 4551.7244C5979.3176) per 100,000 person-years and 131.6711 (95% CI 77.5876C206.8796) per 100,000 person-years. The ASIR and ASDR of atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis are: Incidence (95%CI,per 100,000 person-years), 327.91 (312.76-343.67), 3066.04 (2405.38-3755.38), 1850.44 (1706.25- 1993.74); DALYs (95%CI, per 100,000 person-years), 99.69 (53.09-167.43), 28.06 (17.62-41.78), 3.93 (2.24-6.25). In addition, among the three dermatitis types, the greatest burden was associated with AD. According to the ASDR from 1990 to 2019, the burden of dermatitis has exhibited a slow downward trend in recent years. In 2019, the ASIR showed that the USA had the greatest burden, while the ASDR showed that Asian countries (such as Japan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan) and some European countries (France, Estonia) had the greatest burden. According to SDI stratification and the three major dermatitis types, high ASIR and ASDR corresponded to high SDI areas (especially for AD). CONCLUSION: The burden of dermatitis is related to socioeconomic development status, especially for AD, which is positively correlated with the SDI. The results based on GBD2019 data are valuable for formulating policy, preventing and treating dermatitis and reducing the global burden of dermatitis.","output":"Global Burden, Incidence and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years for Dermatitis: A Systematic Analysis Combined With Socioeconomic Development Status, 1990C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Population mobility has been one of the most basic social characteristics of Chinas reform and opening up for more than 40 years.

AIMS: It was aimed to assess treatment continuity, the course of psoriasis and the course and clinical features of COVID\\\\19 in patients treated with biological agents for psoriasis at the early initial period of COVID\\\\19 pandemic. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients treated with biological agents for psoriasis at our institute were contacted by phone between 1 and 10 July 2020 and fulfilled a questionnaire about their continuity to psoriasis treatments, clinical course of psoriasis, and any suspicion/diagnosis of COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients, 41 females and 65 males, were enrolled. Mean age of the patients was 46.1  12.1 years (range: 19C77). Median duration of psoriasis was 18 years (minCmax: 1 monthC51 years). Twenty\\\\four patients (22.6%) were using tumor necrosis alpha inhibitors (ETA:1, IFX:19, ADA:4), whereas 82 patients (77.4%) were using interleukin (IL) 12/23 or IL\\\\17 inhibitors (UST:48, SECU:30, IXE:4). Seventy\\\\six patients (71.7%) continued the treatment, whereas 30 patients (28.3%) interrupted the treatment voluntarily. Twenty out of 30 patients (66.6%) who interrupted the treatment had an exacerbation of psoriasis. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 in the study period. CONCLUSION: Patients with psoriasis who received biological therapy continued their treatment at a high rate during the early period of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. No COVID\\\\19 diagnosis was made among patients whether they continued or discontinued treatment. Recurrence and exacerbation of psoriasis in a significant proportion of patients who interrupted treatment and absence of COVID\\\\19 diagnosis in each group support the importance and safety of continuity of biological treatments for psoriasis in COVID\\\\19 era.","output":"Treatment of psoriasis with biologics in the early COVID\\\\19 pandemic: A study examining patient attitudes toward the treatment and disease course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease has wreaked havoc on the world community in terms of every imaginable parameter The research output on COVID-19 has been nothing short of phenomenal, especially in the medical and biomedical sciences, where the search for a potential vaccine is being conducted in earnest Much of the advanced research has been distributed in the leading medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), where the latest research is distributed on a daily basis The purpose of this paper is to provide some perspectives on 44 interesting and highly topical research papers that have been published in JAMA, at the time of writing, within the past two weeks The diverse topics include public health, general medicine, internal medicine, oncology, paediatrics, geriatrics, and biostatistics","output":"Perspectives on Topical Medical Research in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become apparent that palliative care has dynamically adapted to the care of dying patients with and without COVID-19 and has developed new forms of collaboration.

DESIGN: Qualitative interview study (German Clinical Trials Register; identifier 22,473) with qualitative content analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: During the first wave of the pandemic, the University Medical Center Freiburg (Germany) established an ad hoc unit delivering acute palliative care for COVID-19 patients likely to die. Nurses from non-palliative areas and the specialist palliative care team formed a new team working together there. Twenty-nine individuals from management and staff of this unit were interviewed. RESULTS: Patient care and teamwork were rated positively. Joint familiarization, bedside teaching, and team/management support were evaluated as core elements for success. Challenges for the nurses from non-palliative settings included adapting to palliative care routines and culture of care. The palliative care team had to adjust the high standards of palliative care to pandemic conditions. Due to sufficient hospital-wide capacity, only three COVID-19 patients were treated, significantly fewer than anticipated at planning.

The current study aimed to replicate these results in a separate cohort of patients with fibromyalgia recruited at a new location using a similar study design. Twenty patients with fibromyalgia and 20 healthy controls were included in the replication study. Group fMRI analyses revealed a solid and consistent trend of main findings similar to the previous results. Specifically, in the replication cohort of patients with fibromyalgia, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity was reduced during gain anticipation and increased during no-loss (non-punishment) outcomes, as compared to controls. Similar to the Martucci et al. results, again in the replication cohort, nucleus accumbens activity during gain anticipation did not differ in patients compared to controls. The same behavioral, correlational, and exploratory analyses that were conducted in the Martucci et al. study were conducted in the present replication study, with prior results largely replicated here.

METHODS: We analyzed the expression of MRGs using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to screen differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional pathway enrichment analysis of the DE-MRGs was performed. LASSO and Cox regression analyses were performed to select MRGs closely related to EC patient outcomes. A prognostic signature was developed, and the efficacy was validated in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort. Moreover, we developed a comprehensive nomogram including the risk model and clinical features to predict EC patients' survival probability. RESULTS: Forty-seven DE-MRGs were significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these MRGs were highly enriched in amino acid, glycolysis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Nine MRGs were found to be closely related to EC patient outcomes: CYP4F3, CEL, GPAT3, LYPLA2, HNMT, PHGDH, CKM, UCK2 and ACACB. Based on these nine DE-MRGs, we developed a prognostic signature, and its efficacy in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort was validated. The nine-MRG signature was independent of other clinical features, and could effectively distinguish high- and low-risk EC patients and predict patient OS.

Among these measures, enhancing the knowledge, positive attitudes, and proper practices of prevention measures about the disease is a basic strategy to control it. However, community compliance to control measures is largely dependent on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To assess the current level of KAP towards COVID-19 pandemic and predictors among the rural dwellers in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia; 2020. METHODS: This community-based prospective cross-sectional study was carried out from May 1-30, 2020 on a sample of 1,278 adult populations in Sidama regional state, Southern Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to choice the study participants. The data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. We have entered data using Epi data version 3.1 and all analyses were done using SPSS version 25. KAPs scores of study participants based on their independent variables were compared using Chi-square test, t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as required. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with KAP. The important assumptions of the logistic regression model were checked to be satisfied. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the existence and strength of associations. RESULTS: From a total of 1,214 study participants, the overall attained knowledge, attitude and practice score about COVID-19 were 90%, 82.4% and 65%, respectively. Among these, 43.9%, 37.5%, and 24.4% of the study participants had demonstrated good knowledge, high attitude and proper practice, respectively. The mean knowledge scores were significantly different between sex, categories of marital status, educational levels, main occupation, and the monthly income quintiles of the study participants (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean attitude scores significantly varied across educational levels, main occupations and marital status (p<0.05). Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, main occupation of the government employees, education level of diploma and above, highest and second highest wealth rank were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention and control practice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of study participants had showed good knowledge and optimistic attitude toward COVID-19. But, the level of practice lower than that expected to maximize effective control measures.

However, equestrian land has been overlooked in environmental research and policy. This study reports on the ways which horse, pony, donkey and mule keepers in the UK described environmental practices as part of their equid care. Through an analysis of survey responses (N = 758) from equid keepers using alternative grazing systems, we report on three very different management approaches which resulted in keepers aiming to promote healthy pastures and healthy animals. This study provides the basis for future research exploring attitudes to sustainability in equid keepers, as well as evaluating the impact of their efforts. ABSTRACT: Equestrian grazing management is a poorly researched area, despite potentially significant environmental impacts. This study explored keepers use of alternative grazing systems in the care of UK horses, donkeys and mules through an internet survey. The survey was available during the summer of 2020 and comprised closed and open questions, which were analysed with descriptive statistics and iterative thematic analysis, respectively. A total of 758 responses was incorporated into the analysis; the most popular system used were tracks (56.5%), Equicentral (19%), other (e.g., non-grass turnout) (12.5%), rewilding (7.5%) and turnout on either moorland (0.7%) or woodland (2.5%). The thematic analysis highlighted that equid keepers across the systems were highly engaged in exploring sustainable practices. Their approaches varied according to each system, yet all aimed to fulfil practices in three major categories, i.e., supporting diverse plant life (usually through restricting equid access to certain areas), supporting wildlife (through the creation of biodiverse environments) and sustainably managing droppings and helminths. Additionally, proponents of the Equicentral systems declared to be aiming to support soil health. These data provide a promising insight into equid keepers behaviour and attitudes to sustainability.","output":"An Exploration of Environmentally Sustainable Practices Associated with Alternative Grazing Management System Use for Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and Mules in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When an object conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with a food unconditioned stimulus (US), anticipatory goal-directed action directed at the US location (goal tracking) is accompanied by behavior directed at the object CS (sign tracking). Sign-tracking behavior appears to be compulsive and habit-like and predicts increased vulnerability to the addictive potential of drugs in animal models. A large body of the literature also suggests that environmental enrichment protects against the development of addiction-prone phenotypes. Thus, we investigated whether compulsive-like sign tracking develops in environmentally enriched rats trained directly in their enriched home environment. We demonstrate that adolescent enriched-housed male Sprague-Dawley rats readily sign track a 5% ethanol bottle CS in their home environment and at a rate higher than adolescent standard-housed rats. We also show that enriched adolescent rats sign track less than enriched adult-trained rats and that acute isolation stress affects sign- and goal-tracking performance of adolescents and adults differently. Sign tracking increased more in the adult than the adolescent rats. Whereas the younger rats showed a decrease in goal tacking after the final stressor manipulation, the adults showed increased goal tracking. Our results are consistent with recent studies, which suggest that although sign tracking performance is compulsive-like, it is not as inflexible and habit-like as previously assumed. Testing in an enriched home environment with object CSs having greater affordance than neutral lever CSs may provide greater ecological relevance for investigating the development and expression of adaptive and compulsive-like behaviors in translational research.","output":"Sign Tracking in an Enriched Environment: A Potential Ecologically Relevant Animal Model of Adaptive Behavior Change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Preliminary evidence indicates that prophylactic-dose thromboprophylaxis may be inadequate to control the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the D-dimer measurement is useful for VTE risk stratification among COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to offer benchmark data on the incidence of VTE and to examine the difference in D-dimer levels among anticoagulated COVID-19 patients with and without VTE incident. Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed from inception to May 2020 was performed for original studies that reported the frequency of VTE and death among COVID-19 patients who received thromboprophylaxis on hospitalization. The endpoints included VTE (a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)), PE, DVT, and mortality. Results: A total of 11 cohort studies were included. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 23.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 16.2% to 33.7%; I2= 93%) developed VTE despite anticoagulation. PE and DVT were detected in 11.6% (95% CI, 7.5% to 17.5%; I2= 92%) and 11.9% (95% CI, 6.3% to 21.3%; I2= 93%) of patients, respectively. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a higher risk for VTE (30.4% )95% CI, 19.6% to 43.9%)) than those in the ward (13.0% (95% CI, 5.9% to 26.3%)). The mortality was estimated at 21.3% (95% CI, 17.0% to 26.4%; I2= 53%).

Conclusions: The heightened and heterogeneous risk of VTE in COVID-19 despite prophylactic anticoagulation calls into research on the pathogenesis of thromboembolic complications and strategy of thromboprophylaxis and risk stratification.

Government laws and medical operating protocols have been largely modified to provide remote care to reduce social contact and ensure a safer patient environment. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the Ministry of Health (MOH) introduced several forms of telemedicine as alternatives to face-to-face consultations in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the awareness and utilization of telehealth services before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in the KSA. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we compared the awareness and utilization of 937-telephone health services (ie, a toll-free telephone service to provide medical and administrative health care services at any time for the population) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in the KSA. Using a convenience sampling technique, a validated web-based questionnaire was distributed on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) at 2 timepoints: before (February 2019) and during (May 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The study sample comprised a total of 1961 participants who completed the questionnaire before (n=1303, 66%) and during (n=658, 33%) the COVID-19 pandemic. Both awareness (before=46% vs during=78%) and utilization (before=42% vs during=48%) of the 937-telephone health services increased significantly during the pandemic (P<.001).

Two hundred and forty-three individuals were swabbed three times by healthcare professionals: a NMTS and a NPS specimen for the Ag-RDT and an oropharyngeal swab for real time RT-PCR. Forty-nine participants were RNA-SARS-CoV-2 positive by real time RT-PCR: 45 and 40 were positive by the Ag-RDT with NPS and NMTS, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 91.8% (95% CI: 83.2C100.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 98.2C100.0) for Ag-RDT with NPS, and 81.6% (95% CI: 69.8C93.5) and 100.0% (95% CI: 99.7C100.0) for the Ag-RDT with NMTS.

However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.72).

To address this, we use a parsimony-based method to reconstruct possible genealogical histories for samples of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which enables us to pinpoint specific recombination events that could have generated the data. We propose a statistical framework for disentangling the effects of recurrent mutation from recombination in the history of a sample, and hence provide a way of estimating the probability that ongoing recombination is present. We apply this to samples of sequencing data collected in England and South Africa, and find evidence of ongoing recombination.","output":"Ongoing recombination in SARS-CoV-2 revealed through genealogical reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused monumental mortality, and there are still no adequate therapies. Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called cytokine storm and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. Here we highlight a mechanism by which the IL6-hypoxia curse causes a deadly hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, and we suggest a path to therapy.","output":"COVID-19: a probable role of the anticoagulant Protein S in managing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adult cardiac surgery by reviewing current data and use this to establish methods for safely continuing to carry out surgery. METHODS: Conduction of a literature search via PubMed using the search terms: (adult cardiac OR cardiothoracic OR surgery OR minimally invasive OR sternotomy OR hemi-sternotomy OR aortic valve OR mitral valve OR elective OR emergency) AND (COVID-19 or coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV OR 2019 novel coronavirus OR pandemic). Thirty-two articles were selected. RESULTS: Cardiac surgery patients have an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 and require vital finite resources such as intensive care beds, also required by COVID-19 patients. Thus reducing their admission and potential hospital-acquired infection with COVID-19 is paramount. During the peak, only emergencies such as acute aortic dissections were treated, triaging patients according to surgical priority and cancelling all elective procedures. Screening and 2-week quarantine prior to admission were essential changes, alongside additional levels of PPE. Focus was on reducing length of stay and switching to day-cases to reduce post-operative transmission risk, whilst several hospitals adopted hot and cold operating theatres for covid-confirmed and covid-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: This paper suggests a CARDIO approach for reintroducing elective procedures: Care, Assess, Re-Evaluate, Develop, Implement, Overcome; prioritising the mental and physical health of the workforce, learning from and sharing experiences and objectively prioritising patients to improve case load.","output":"The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on adult cardiac surgery and suggestions for safe continuation throughout the pandemic: a review of expert opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in consumption of single-use plastics (SUPs), particularly in the food service sector, due to concerns for public health and safety. To follow public health guidelines, food services have been limited to takeout service and have restricted use of personal reusable items. This study investigated opportunities to reduce increased use of SUPs in Nova Scotia food services sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with stakeholders from the food service sector. Many participants had already implemented SUP reduction strategies prior to COVID-19. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses to rely on SUPs and to pause SUP reduction strategies. Obstacles to SUP reduction included operational challenges from COVID-19 restrictions, misunderstanding of local waste management systems, costs of transitioning to zero plastic waste, poorly manufactured alternatives, greenwashing, and ingrained societal convenience culture. Whilst not all SUP consumption patterns were attributed to COVID-19, these barriers prevented food retailers, waste managers and consumers from achieving zero-plastic waste goals. Food services should adopt SUP reduction strategies, including re-introducing reusables, implementing exchange programs for bulk items and takeout, providing education and awareness to staff and consumers, and sourcing sustainable SUP alternatives. SUP reduction strategies can be implemented immediately as public health officials and researchers agree reusable items can be used safely when using basic hygiene measures. Food services across Nova Scotia should adapt their operational procedures and create behaviour change to reduce SUPs.","output":"Opportunities for single-use plastic reduction in the food service sector during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nematic liquid crystals of achiral molecules or racemic mixtures of chiral ones form flat films when suspended in submillimeter size grids and submerged under water. Recently, it has been shown (Popov et al., 2017) that films of nematic liquid crystals doped with chiral molecules adopt biconvex lens shapes underwater. The curved shape together with degenerate planar anchoring leads to a radial variation of the optical axis along the plane of the film, providing a Pancharatnam-Berry-type phase lens that modifies geometric optical imaging. Here, we describe nematic liquid crystal microlenses formed by the addition of chiral nanoparticles. It is found that the helical twisting power of the nanoparticles, the key factor to form the lens, is about 400 m-1, greater than that of the strongest molecular chiral dopants. We demonstrate imaging capabilities and measure the shape as well as the focal length of the chiral nanoparticle-doped liquid crystal lens. We show that measuring the shape of the lens allows one to calculate the helical pitch of the chiral nematic liquid crystal and thus determine the helical twisting power of the chiral ligand-capped nanoparticles. Such measurements require the use of only nanograms of chiral nanoparticles, which is 3 orders of magnitude less than that required by conventional techniques. Since NPs are sensitive to external stimuli such as light and electric and magnetic fields, the use of chiral NPs may allow the achievement of tunable optical properties for such microlens arrays.","output":"Converging Microlens Array Using Nematic Liquid Crystals Doped with Chiral Nanoparticles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As an immune modulator, vitamin D has been implicated in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcome. We aim to systematically explore the association of vitamin D serum levels with COVID-19 severity and prognosis. METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from six studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Mean vitamin D serum level of 376 patients, was 21.9 nmol/L (95% CI = 15.36-28.45). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.1%, p < .001). Patients with poor prognosis (N = 150) had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D compared with those with good prognosis (N = 161), representing an adjusted standardized mean difference of -0.58 (95% Cl = -0.83 to -0.34, p < .001).

Understanding the psychological consequences of the UKs lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified, and appropriate support can be implemented. METHODS: Participants were a convenience sample of parents and carers (n = 2,988) in the UK with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years who completed an online survey about their childs mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from monthly assessments over four months. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and emotional symptoms separately, and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. RESULTS: Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time, whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four, and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained stable low symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July.

Neuroplasticity research illustrates that preventive steps strengthen the brain's component systems; however, this information is not widely known. Actionable steps are needed to scale proven population-level interventions. Objectives: This pilot tested two main objectives: (1) the feasibility/ease of use of an online platform to measure brain health, deliver training, and offer virtual coaching to healthy adults and (2) to develop a data driven index of brain health. Methods: 180 participants, ages 18-87, enrolled in this 12-week pilot. Participants took a BrainHealth Index&#8482; (BHI), a composite of assessments encompassing cognition, well-being, daily-life and social, pre-post training. Participants engaged in online training with three coaching sessions. We assessed changes in BHI, effects of training utilization and demographics, contributions of sub-domain measures to the BHI and development of a factor analytic structure of latent BrainHealth constructs. Results: The results indicated that 75% of participants showed at least a 5-point gain on their BHI which did not depend on age, education, or gender. The contribution to these gains were from all sub-domains, including stress, anxiety and resilience, even though training focused largely on cognition. Some individuals improved due to increased resilience and decreased anxiety, whereas others improved due to increased innovation and social engagement. Larger gains depended on module utilization, especially strategy training. An exploratory factor analytic solution to the correlation matrix of online assessments identified three latent constructs. Discussion/Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of an online platform to assess changes on a composite BrainHealth Index and efficacy in delivering training modules and coaching. We found that adults, college age to late life, were motivated to learn about their brain and engage in virtual-training with coaching to improve their brain health. This effort intends to scale up to thousands, thus the pilot data, tested by an impending imaging pilot, will be utilized in ongoing machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a precision brain health model.

This study aims to review the current evidence for training and skills acquisition for SILS. METHODS A comprehensive database search of PubMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar was carried out. Studies considered for inclusion were those addressing SILS learning curves, skills acquisition, or training. RESULTS 21 studies were included in the final analysis. Ten clinical case series with analysis of SILS learning curve demonstrated a significant learning curve for conventional multiport laparoscopic (LAP)-trained surgeons over the course of initial SILS cases, with several studies reporting increased risk of conversion and complication rates. Five laboratory-based studies demonstrated differences in SILS skills acquisition compared with LAP. Six studies describing SILS-specific training curricula were analysed, but none included a robust validation of the curriculum. CONCLUSIONS Clinical case series and laboratory-based skills acquisition studies demonstrate the unique requirements of SILS, with skill sets and ergonomic demands which cannot be directly adapted from existing LAP experience. Some studies have already reported higher complication rates in initial SILS cases. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, the implementation of an evidence- and competency-based SILS curriculum is necessary to ensure appropriate training of future SILS surgeons.","output":"Have we learned from lessons of the past?

Institutional punishment of wrong-doers is well-known to curtail their impetus as free-riders. However, institutions often have limited scope in imposing sanctions, more so when these are strict and potentially viewed as disproportionate. Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment.

(TGF?) family ligand antagonist, follistatin 288 (FS288). Follistatin neutralizes the TGF? ligands, myostatin and activin A, by forming a nearly irreversible non-signaling complex by surrounding the ligand and preventing interaction with TGF? receptors. The FS288-ligand complex has higher affinity than unbound FS288 for heparin/HS, which accelerates ligand internalization and lysosomal degradation; however, limited information is available for how FS288 interactions with heparin affect ligand binding. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we show that preincubation of FS288 with heparin/HS significantly decreased the association kinetics for both myostatin and activin A with seemingly no effect on the dissociation rate. This observation is dependent on the heparin/HS chain length where small chain lengths less than degree of polymerization 10 (dp10) did not alter association rates but chain lengths >dp10 decreased association rates. In an attempt to understand the mechanism for this observation, we uncovered that heparin induced dimerization of follistatin. Consistent with our SPR results, we found that dimerization only occurs with heparin molecules >dp10. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the FS288 heparin complex supports that FS288 adopts a dimeric configuration that is similar to the FS288 dimer in the ligand-bound state.

Mean length of stay was 12.113.3 days and mean total cost was $35,99132,496. Mechanical ventilation rates were 34.1% and in-hospital mortality was 22.5%. Mean cost trended downward over time (p = 0.02) from $55,275 (March) to $18,211 (August). Mechanical ventilation rates trended down (p<0.01) from 53.8% (March) to 20.3% (August). Overall mortality rates also decreased (p<0.01) from 28.4% (March) to 13.7% (August). Mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients were similar over time (p = 0.45), but mortality in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation decreased from March-May compared to June-July (13.5% vs 4.6%, p<0.01).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. DESIGN: In a multicenter cohort study of 3239 critically ill adults with COVID-19, the incidence of VTE and major bleeding within 14 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated. A target trial emulation in which patients were categorized according to receipt or no receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation in the first 2 days of ICU admission was done to examine the observational effect of early therapeutic anticoagulation on survival. A Cox model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding was used. SETTING: 67 hospitals in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with COVID-19 admitted to a participating ICU. MEASUREMENTS: Time to death, censored at hospital discharge, or date of last follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 3239 patients included, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 53 to 71 years), and 2088 (64.5%) were men. A total of 204 patients (6.3%) developed VTE, and 90 patients (2.8%) developed a major bleeding event. Independent predictors of VTE were male sex and higher D-dimer level on ICU admission. Among the 2809 patients included in the target trial emulation, 384 (11.9%) received early therapeutic anticoagulation. In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 days, patients who received early therapeutic anticoagulation had a similar risk for death as those who did not (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.35]).

Post-vaccination interval was restricted to []21 days after dose 1, []14 days after dose 2. The primary outcome was anti-S titres with explanatory variables dose, previous infection, dosing interval, age, ethnicity, and comorbidities. Multivariable linear regression was also conducted. ResultsParticipants (n=5,871) included 3,989 post-dose 1, 1,882 post-dose 2. In SARS-CoV-2 infection naive, 99.65% seroconverted after dose 1 and >99.9% seroconverted after dose 2. Geometric mean anti-S titre in the naive cohort was 75.48 Binding Antibody Units/ml after dose 1, 7,049 BAU/ml after dose 2. Anti-S titres were higher in those with previous infection (2,111 BAU/ml post-dose 1, 16,052 BAU/ml post-dose 2), and increased with time between infection and vaccination: 3 months 1,970 (1,506-2,579) vs 9 months; 13,759 (8,097-23,379). Longer dosing intervals increased antibody response post-dose 2: 11-fold higher with a longer interval (>10 weeks) than those with shorter intervals, across all age-groups. Younger participants had higher mean titres (>2.2-fold higher). Multivariable regression modelling corroborated the above associations, and also found higher titres associated with being female or from an ethnic minority but lower titres among immunocompromised participants.

Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.","output":"Dissecting glycoprotein biosynthesis by the use of specific inhibitors()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent observations have shown that there are two types of COVID-19 response: an H phenotype with high lung elastance and weight, and an L phenotype with low measures.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, in particular the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia, of continuous infusion propofol in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective study at 1 academic medical center and 1 affiliated teaching hospital in New York City. Adult, critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received continuous infusion propofol were included. Patients who received propofol for <12 hours, were transferred from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation, or did not have a triglyceride concentration obtained during the infusion were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were included. Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration &#8805; 400 mg/dL) occurred in 38.9% of patients after a median cumulative dose of 4307 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 2448-9431 mg). The median time to triglyceride elevation was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9-9.1 days). In the multivariable regression analysis, obese patients had a significantly greater odds of hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.10, 3.21). There was no occurrence of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of possible propofol-related infusion syndrome was 3.2%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 who received propofol but did not lead to acute pancreatitis. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than previously reported in patients without COVID-19.

Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects.

In this study, mutations were identified in 253 Influenza A (H3N2) clinical isolates from the 2016-2017 influenza season in Belgium. As a proof of concept, available patient data were integrated with this genomic data, resulting in statistically significant associations that could be relevant to improve the vaccine and clinical management of infected patients.

This resulted in several mutations that were significantly associated with patients suffering from renal insufficiency. This study demonstrates the usefulness of using WGS data for tracking mutations across the complete genome and linking these to patient data, and illustrates the importance of accounting for the viral genetic background in association studies. A limitation of this association study, especially when analyzing stratified groups, relates to the number of samples, especially in the context of national surveillance of small countries.

Interactions with host receptors and coreceptors trigger a cascade of conformational changes/structural rearrangements in spikes, which bring virus and host membranes in proximity for membrane fusion required for virus entry. Spike-mediated viral membrane fusion is a dynamic, multi-step process, and understanding the structureCfunction-dynamics paradigm of virus spikes is essential to elucidate viral membrane fusion, with the ultimate goal of interventions.

We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19. Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care. Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas. Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19. South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.","output":"National Response to COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea and Lessons Learned for Other Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Vaccine hesitancy poses one of the biggest threats to global health. Informing people about the collective benefit of vaccination due to community immunity has great potential in increasing vaccination intentions. Novel communication formats are needed to increase peoples interest in and engagement with such information, boosting the interventions effectiveness. This research investigates the potential for virtual reality (VR) to strengthen participants understanding of community immunity, and therefore, their intention to get vaccinated.Methods and Findings. In this pre-registered lab-in-the-field intervention study, participants (n= 222) were recruited in a public park. They either experienced the collective benefit of community immunity in a gamified immersive virtual reality environment (2/3 of sample), or received the same information via text and images (1/3 of sample). Before and after the intervention, participants indicated their intention to take up a hypothetical vaccine for a new COVID-19 strain (0C100 scale) and belief in vaccination as a collective responsibility (1C7 scale). After the VR treatment, for participants with imperfect vaccination intention, intention increases by 9.3 points (95% CI:7.0 to 11.5, p <0.001). The text-and-image treatment increases vaccination intention by 3.3 points (difference in effects: 5.8, 95% CI: 2.0 to 9.5, p= 0.003). The VR treatment also increases collective responsibility by 0.82 points (95% CI: 0.37 to 1.27, p <0.001). A key limitation of the study is that it measures vaccination attitudes, but not behavior.Conclusions. VR is an effective tool for increasing vaccination intention, more so than text and images, by eliciting collective responsibility. The results suggest that VR interventions can be applied in the wild and may thus provide a complementary method for vaccine advocacy","output":"Virtual reality reduces COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the wild"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reports suggesting a beneficial effect of nicotine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity may encourage smoking. We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus.

The aims were to identify potential druggable binding pockets in the protein and, if located, to virtual screen pharmaceutical agents currently in use for predicted affinity to these pockets which might be useful to restrict, reduce, or inhibit the infectivity of the virion. RESULTS: Our analyses of this structure have revealed a key potentially druggable pocket where it might be viable to bind pharmaceutical agents to inhibit its ability to infect human cells. This pocket is found at the inter-chain interface that exists between two domains prior to the virion binding to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. One of these domains is the highly mobile receptor binding domain, which must move into position to interact with ACE2, which is an essential feature for viral entry to the host cell. Virtual screening with a library of purchasable drug molecules has identified pharmaceuticals currently in use as prescription and over the counter medications that, in silico, readily bind into this pocket. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights possible drugs already in use as pharmaceuticals that may act as agents to interfere with the movements of the domains within this protein essential for the infectivity processes and hence might slow, or even halt, the infection of host cells by this new coronavirus. As these are existing pharmaceuticals already approved for use in humans, this knowledge could accelerate their roll-out, through repurposing, for affected individuals and help guide the efforts of other researchers in finding effective treatments for the disease.","output":"Identification of a druggable binding pocket in the spike protein reveals a key site for existing drugs potentially capable of combating Covid-19 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To discuss remote activities in nursing education in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic for strengthening nursing from the perspective of the \\"Nursing Now\\" campaign.

The aim of this study was to compare LMov of the left and right CCA of healthy subjects to investigate whether the difference in anatomy are of importance for LMov. The CCA's of 93 healthy subjects were investigated using in-house developed ultrasound methods.

To explore the role of CSF1 in steady-state control of monocyte production and differentiation and tissue repair, we previously developed a bioactive protein with a longer half-life in circulation by fusing pig CSF1 with the Fc region of pig IgG1a. CSF1-Fc administration to pigs expanded progenitor pools in the marrow and selectively increased monocyte numbers and their expression of the maturation marker CD163. There was a rapid increase in the size of the liver, and extensive proliferation of hepatocytes associated with increased macrophage infiltration. Despite the large influx of macrophages, there was no evidence of liver injury and no increase in circulating liver enzymes. Microarray expression profiling of livers identified increased expression of macrophage markers, i.e., cytokines such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 known to influence hepatocyte proliferation, alongside cell cycle genes. The analysis also revealed selective enrichment of genes associated with portal, as opposed to centrilobular regions, as seen in hepatic regeneration. Combined with earlier data from the mouse, this study supports the existence of a CSF1-dependent feedback loop, linking macrophages of the liver with bone marrow and blood monocytes, to mediate homeostatic control of the size of the liver. The results also provide evidence of safety and efficacy for possible clinical applications of CSF1-Fc.","output":"Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) controls monocyte production and maturation and the steady-state size of the liver in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate immune system is one of the first lines of defense against invading pathogens.

This study assessed real-world ALK testing patterns among community practices in the United States in patients with advanced (stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC. METHODS: Patients age  18 years with two or more visits within the Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived database after January 2011 and diagnosed with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC through May 2017 were included in this analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and testing for ALK rearrangements. RESULTS: Of 31,483 patients analyzed from the database, 16,726 patients (53.1%) were tested for ALK rearrangements. ALK testing rates were 66.9% and 18.5% in patients with nonsquamous and squamous histology, respectively. Average ALK testing rates increased over time from 32.4% in 2011 to 62.1% in 2016. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was the most common ALK testing method. Agreement between fluorescent in situ hybridization and other assays ranged from 94.1% to 97.9%. Median (interquartile range) time from laboratory receipt of sample to first ALK test result was 7 (7) days; median time from advanced diagnosis to first ALK test result was 25 (29) days. Patients who were older, male, had a history of smoking, lived in non-Western US regions, and who had recurrent disease or squamous histology were less likely to be tested for ALK. Patients with Medicaid and Medicare insurance were less likely to be tested than patients with commercial insurance. Overall, 21.5% of patients initiated therapy (20.4% chemotherapy) before receiving test results. CONCLUSION: ALK testing rates have increased over time. However, certain subgroups of patients are less likely to be tested, suggesting that additional education on molecular testing is warranted.","output":"ALK Testing Trends and Patterns Among Community Practices in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Describe the development, delivery, acceptability and evaluation of a modular training programme for community-based, non-medical practitioners monitoring patients with quiescent neovascular age related macular degeneration (QnAMD). Also, report on a qualitative process evaluation conducted during the pilot phase of a randomised control trial (the FENETRE Study) exploring patient and practitioner acceptability of community-based QnAMD care relative to hospital-based care. METHODS Learning outcomes from The College of Optometrists' Medical Retina higher qualifications and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists' Common Clinical Competency Framework were used to develop a competency framework for QnAMD care. Training was delivered online, comprising six asynchronous lectures followed by two synchronous case-based discussion webinars, with an accredited assessment of 24 case vignettes. An anonymous evaluation survey was conducted with the first two FENETRE cohorts (n = 38). Separately, we undertook a qualitative process evaluation, sampling purposively in four hospitals and five community-based practices, interviewing nine patients and eight practitioners. RESULTS Survey responses (n = 26) showed community optometrists were very satisfied (n = 12; 46%) or satisfied (n = 14; 54%) with the training; feedback reflected by qualitative process evaluation data. Overall, optometrists also felt either confident (n = 15; 58%) or very confident (n = 8; 31%) in conducting AMD monitoring appointments following training, a finding also corroborated by interview data from optometrists participating in the initial pilot phase roll-out. Optometrists identified patient convenience and alleviating pressures in hospital care as the primary reasons for acceptability of community pathways. Data from patients entering community practices suggested they largely found this at least as safe and convenient as hospital care, although some patients randomised to hospital care perceived that as safer. CONCLUSION This pilot study has shown the development and implementation of a collaborative community monitoring model is feasible, with satisfaction from community optometrists for training and accreditation, and broad acceptance for the pathway by both patients and practitioners.","output":"Evaluation of training, patient and practitioner perspectives on community-based monitoring of patients with stable age-related macular degeneration compared to hospital-based care: The FENETRE study report no. 1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 wastewater surveillance has gained widespread acceptance to monitor community infection trends.

Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students.

METHODS We performed an interrupted time series study using structured quality improvement methodology. Three interventions were introduced to address vaccination barriers: an in-house vaccination program, a staff education campaign, and a patient care bundle (pre-printed prescription, information brochure, vaccine record booklet). Process and outcome data were collected by patient survey and pharmacy audit and analyzed on statistical process control charts. RESULTS We identified 195 eligible patients. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates rose significantly from 5% to a monthly mean of 61% and from 36% to a monthly mean of 67%, respectively. The 80% target was reached for both vaccines during one or more months of study. The in-house vaccination and staff education programs were major contributors to the improvement, whereas the information brochure and record booklet were minor contributors. CONCLUSIONS Three interventions to promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination among chemotherapy patients resulted in significantly improved vaccination rates.

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives to expand the program to all chemotherapy patients at our centre are underway.","output":"A pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza vaccination quality improvement program for women receiving chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers at a major tertiary cancer Centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illness, a leading cause of cough in children, accounts for a substantial proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In some children acute cough progresses to chronic cough (>4 weeks duration), impacting on morbidity and decreasing quality of life. Despite the importance of chronic cough as a cause of substantial childhood morbidity and associated economic, family and social costs, data on the prevalence, predictors, aetiology and natural history of the symptom are scarce. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children presenting to a tertiary paediatric emergency department. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of children aged <15 years attending the Royal Childrens Hospital Emergency Department, Brisbane, for a respiratory illness that includes parent reported cough (wet or dry) as a symptom. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence and predictors of chronic cough (4 weeks duration) post presentation with acute respiratory illness. Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological and clinical data are completed at enrolment. Subjects complete daily cough dairies and weekly follow-up contacts for 28(3) days to ascertain cough persistence. Children who continue to cough for 28 days post enrolment are referred to a paediatric respiratory physician for review. Primary analysis will be the proportion of children with persistent cough at day 28(3). Multivariate analyses will be performed to evaluate variables independently associated with chronic cough at day 28(3). DISCUSSION: Our protocol will be the first to comprehensively describe the natural history, epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children. The results will contribute to studies leading to the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines to improve the early detection and management of chronic cough in children during and after acute respiratory illness.","output":"The development of chronic cough in children following presentation to a tertiary paediatric emergency department with acute respiratory illness: study protocol for a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toward the end of the year 2019, there was the eruption of an acute respiratory syndrome, which is widely referred as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, Hubei Province. The disease causes a range of respiratory illnesses, which are fatal. The COVID-19 disease has spread globally and has significantly impacted the health delivery systems, travel regulations, and economic activities and has posed and upsurge of responsibilities for the frontline healthcare workers. Due to the nature of the COVID-19 disease, it has typically caused complications which include pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction together with renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of date, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 though there are ongoing research studies to formulate a treatment. COVID-19 is highly contagious, and the risk of infection is higher for patients with immunesuppressed patients than regular patients. The immunesuppressed conditions include cancer, HIV, and patients with solid organ transplants (SOT). This paper aims to review the risk and impact of COVID-19 on immunesuppressed patients, with a focus on cancer, HIV, and patients with SOT and the essence of special parameters for their care and management. Despite the fatal effects of this global pandemic, the findings of this study indicate the high risk which immunosuppressed patients have to contract the disease; thus, the governments and health delivery systems have to offer them extra support and treatment.","output":"The Risk and Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Immunosuppressed Patients: Cancer, HIV, and Solid Organ Transplant Recipients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide.

Centro de Terapia Oncologica (CTO) is a Oncology clinic in Petropolis, countryside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This discussion aims to appoint the necessity of mass testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic health-care workers (HCWs), in order to avoid workforce unnecessary quarantine, reduce spread in asymptomatic or mild cases and protect the health of HCWs and patients. Method(s): Between 09 and 29 April of 2020, 60 CTO HCWs were tested for COVID-19. They were all tested through IgM/IgG rapid testing by near-patient lateral flow devices, while nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were added as a secondary investigational method amongst symptomatic HCWs. In total, 62 tests were done: 61 IgM/IgG tests were done and 1 nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR testing. Result(s): A total of 4 HCW tested positive among 62 tests. They were all immediately quarantined for 14 days and represent 6,6% of the service's total workforce. Out of the 4 positive cases, 2 were female, with 60 years or more, and the remaining 2 were men aged between 30 and 42 years;3 of these HCW were asymptomatic and only 1 had symptoms of the disease. Results illustrated in the table. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): Wide availability of testing for antibodies and the universal testing of HCW would be a game changer as it: reduces in-hospital transmission;reduces a potential source of asymptomatic ongoing transmission during a period of social distancing;promotes the wellbeing of HCW ensuring that infected colleagues are promptly tested and isolated;enables the service to isolate those who require it, avoiding being short-staffed due to self-isolation or widespread contamination of the HCW.

Therefore, comfort in residential space is crucial to the occupant. As researchers have found traces, that the virus is airborne, the air quality in the residence must be highlighted, especially for people who live in a centralized cooling system residence. When the cooling system is well maintained, there is no significant risk of viral transmission, but not all residential building has HEPA-filters, nor a well-maintained system. This research focuses on the studio room apartment unit, as it has the smallest opening area compared to other room types. A small one-sided opening is not ideal for the wind to move throughout the room. A few design suggestion is simulated under three air-flow speed, to prove that natural ventilation is possible to be adapted, to reach comfort while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. The result is, the indoor wind speed can be enhanced the most at the overall unit area by modifying the fixed window to an operable window, giving upper horizontal opening in the wall across the existing opening, and using gauze doors on both door openings. The furniture layout is proved to affect wind distribution in the room.

The dissemination of misleading information regarding the efficacy of certain drugs or substances for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has been the major contributing factor for this phenomenon. Alongside with the increase in self-medication behavior, the inherent risks to this act such as drugCdrug interactions, adverse events, drug toxicity, and masking of symptoms have also increased. Self-medication in the context of COVID-19 has led to drug misuse leading in some cases to the development of fatal adverse drug reactions. It is important that during this ongoing pandemic drugs with potential clinical efficacy against COVID-19 are adequately analyzed regarding their efficacy, safety, and monitoring. The aim of this review is to describe the available evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and monitoring of the drugs and substances that have been shown to be frequently used for self-medication in patients with COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ivermectin, azithromycin, vitamins, aspirin, and chlorine dioxide) to adequately characterize their risks, safe use, monitoring strategies, and to reinforce the concept that these substances should not be used for self-medication and require a medical prescription. Plain Language Summary Drug safety of frequently used drugs and substances for self-medication in COVID-19 Dissemination of information about potential COVID-19 treatments has led individuals to self-medicate and expose themselves to risks such as drugCdrug interactions, side effects, antibiotic resistance, and misdiagnosis. There is a need to review the medical literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drugs and substances commonly used by the population for the treatment and prevention of SARS CoV-2 infection. In this review, we included drugs that are frequently used for self-medication and commonly advertised such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, chlorine dioxide, azithromycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, among others. A brief introduction of the drug and its mechanism of action, followed by a summary of the efficacy in COVID-19 and safety, will be described for each drug in order to promote their responsible use.","output":"Drug safety of frequently used drugs and substances for self-medication in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become an important therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic. The development and research in this field strongly relies on animal models; however, efforts are being made to find alternatives. In this work, we present a new mock circuit for ECMO that allows measurements of the oxygen transfer rate of a membrane lung at full ECMO blood flow. The mock utilizes a large reservoir of heparinized porcine blood to measure the oxygen transfer rate of the membrane lung in a single passage. The oxygen transfer rate is calculated from blood flow, hemoglobin value, venous saturation, and post-membrane arterial oxygen pressure. Before the next measuring sequence, the blood is regenerated to a venous condition with a sweep gas of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The presented mock was applied to investigate the effect of a recirculation loop on the oxygen transfer rate of an ECMO setup. The recirculation loop caused a significant increase in post-membrane arterial oxygen pressure (paO(2)). The effect was strongest for the highest recirculation flow. This was attributed to a smaller boundary layer on gas fibers due to the increased blood velocity. However, the increase in paO(2) did not translate to significant increases in the oxygen transfer rate because of the minor significance of physically dissolved oxygen for gas transfer. In conclusion, our results regarding a new ECMO mock setup demonstrate that recirculation loops can improve ECMO performance, but not enough to be clinically relevant.","output":"A Novel Mock Circuit to Test Full-Flow Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2009 swine flu pandemic outbreak demonstrated the limiting capacity for egg-based vaccines with respect to global vaccine supply within a timely fashion. New vaccine platforms that efficiently can quench pandemic influenza emergences are urgently needed. Since 2009, there has been a profound development of new vaccine platform technologies with respect to prophylactic use in the population, including DNA vaccines. These vaccines are particularly well suited for global pandemic responses as the DNA format is temperature stable and the production process is cheap and rapid. Here, we show that by targeting influenza antigens directly to antigen presenting cells (APC), DNA vaccine efficacy equals that of conventional technologies. A single dose of naked DNA encoding hemagglutinin (HA) from influenza/A/California/2009 (H1N1), linked to a targeting moiety directing the vaccine to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, raised similar humoral immune responses as the adjuvanted split virion vaccine Pandemrix, widely administered in the 2009 pandemic. Both vaccine formats rapidly induced serum antibodies that could protect mice already 8 days after a single immunization, in contrast to the slower kinetics of a seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Importantly, the DNA vaccine also elicited cytotoxic T-cell responses that reduced morbidity after vaccination, in contrast to very limited T-cell responses seen after immunization with Pandemrix and TIV. These data demonstrate that DNA vaccines has the potential as a single dose platform vaccine, with rapid protective effects without the need for adjuvant, and confirms the relevance of naked DNA vaccines as candidates for pandemic preparedness.","output":"Pandemic Preparedness Against Influenza: DNA Vaccine for Rapid Relief"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": As the opioid crisis drives expansion of integrated opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment programs in generalist settings, these programs will contend with significant rates of co-occurring alcohol use.

This study aimed to assess the outcomes and economic impact of a province-wide quality improvement initiative in Canada. DESIGN: Retrospective population-based study with interrupted time series and return on investment analyses. SETTING: The sepsis cases and deaths averted over time for British Columbia were calculated and compared with the rest of Canada (excluding Quebec and three territories). PATIENTS: Aggregate data were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information on risk-adjusted in-hospital sepsis rates and sepsis mortality in acute care sites across Canada. INTERVENTIONS: In 2012, the British Columbia Sepsis Network was formed to reduce sepsis occurrence and mortality through education, knowledge translation, and quality improvement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A return on investment analysis compared the financial investment for the British Columbia Sepsis Network with the savings from averted sepsis occurrence and mortality. An estimated 981 sepsis cases and 172 deaths were averted in the post-British Columbia Sepsis Network period (2014C2018). The total cost, including the development and implementation of British Columbia Sepsis Network, was $449,962. Net savings due to cases averted after program costs were considered were $50.6 million in 2018. This translates into a return of $112.5 for every dollar invested. CONCLUSIONS: British Columbia Sepsis Network appears to have averted a greater number of sepsis cases and deaths in British Columbia than the national average and yielded a positive return on investment.

The goal of this study was to generate expert consensus on best evaluative practices for holistic CC assessments of ocean-based salmon aquaculture. To achieve this goal, a 3-round Delphi study was conducted with 21 aquaculture and carrying capacity experts from around the world. Experts emphasized that the holistic CC process should i) engage all stakeholders in the process, ii) consider the combination of social, political, ecological, and economic aspects, iii) respond to changes over time, iv) consider multiple spatial and temporal scales, and v) be understandable and clear to all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, the expert panel emphasized the need for a cyclical and dynamic process that allows for the incorporation of feedback in the planning stages, embracing adaptive management. Due to the early stages of truly holistic assessments, the experts recognized challenges related to knowledge uncertainties and lack of approaches to integrate socio-economic data with ecological and physical data, potential conflicts arising from a multi-stakeholder process, and ill-equipped governance structures.

Despite the presence of a few reports of human lophomoniasis, the true burden of Lophomonas infection is unknown. This systematic review aimed to elucidate the latest global status of publications reporting human cases of lophomoniasis as a new emerging protozoal disease. METHODS: A comprehensive and systematic search was performed in 10 (five English and five Persian) databases for studies reporting cases of lophomoniasis between 1993 and March 2020 (27 years). Then, the selected articles were carefully reviewed and screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 32 eligible publications reporting 307 lophomoniasis cases from around the world are included in this review. The patients were aged between 1 month and 84 (mean age = 23.7 years). The highest number of cases (n = 171; 55.7%, P < 0.04) significantly belonged to the juvenile age group (aged 18 years). The male to female ratio of the cases was almost equal, and no statistically significant difference between them was observed. The maximum number of cases (n = 237) was reported from Iran.

However, less attention has focused on the psychoeducational impact on children and their families. To our knowledge, no currently available studies have looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with dyslexia and their families. Research on this topic is needed to offer greater support for this population of students and their families. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to examine the psychoeducational impact of the required COVID-19 quarantine in Spain among children with dyslexia and their families. Method: A sample of 32 children with dyslexia and their mothers participated in this study. Measures: Children and adolescents with dyslexia and their mother completed several measures before the required national quarantine in Spain and again during the quarantine. Children completed measures of depression, state anxiety, reading activity, and reading motivation. Mothers provided demographic information and completed measures related to students' emotional and behavioral difficulties as well as parenting stress, parental distress, and a questionnaire about educational problems during quarantine. Results: Major findings showed that during quarantine, children with dyslexia had increased levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and parents perceived their children as having more emotional symptoms, hyperactivity-inattention, and conduct problems. During quarantine, children and adolescents with dyslexia also showed less reading activity and less reading motivation. Parents also reported significantly more stress, during quarantine compared to pre-quarantine conditions. Some demographic and psychological variables predicted children's state anxiety as well parental stress. The questionnaire related to impacts of quarantine also revealed several important findings. For example, nearly all parents of children with dyslexia reported (a) difficulties in establishing study routines, (b) that the quarantine negatively affected their child's learning, and (c) that they did not receive sufficient help from teachers on how to support their child's learning. Additionally, the vast majority of the parents were very worried about the child's learning and school success, the child's motivation and interest in reading, the child's peer relations, and the professional skills of the child's teacher. Conclusion: This study offers a preliminary investigation into this topic and elucidates several psychoeducational challenges that children with dyslexia and their families have experienced during the quarantine in Spain. Study findings highlight the need to provide immediate support for children with dyslexia and emphasizes the importance of developing prevention programs to mitigate any future negative impacts of COVID-19 on children with dyslexia and their parents.","output":"Psychoeducational Challenges in Spanish Children With Dyslexia and Their Parents' Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Health campaign interventions, particularly those tailored to the target audiences needs and preferences, can cost-effectively change peoples attitudes and behaviors towards better health decision-making However, there is limited research on how to best tailor seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns for young adults Vaccination is vital in protecting young adults and their social circles (vulnerable populations like older adults) from the influenza virus and critical in shaping these emerging adults vaccination habits in the long run However, amid the prevalence of easily-accessible, attention-grabbing, and often malicious false and misinformation (e g , COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories), it may be more challenging to develop vaccination messages that resonate with young adults well enough to attract their attention Therefore, to bridge the research gap, this study examines young adults preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns to inform effective intervention design and development Methods Qualitative survey questions were developed to gauge young adults preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns A total of 545 young adults (73 9% female, Mage= 19 89, SD = 1 44) from a large University offered complete answers to a cross-sectional online survey Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis procedures were adopted to guide the data analysis process Results Thematic analysis revealed that young adults prefer seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns that rely on (1) quality and balanced information from (2) credible information sources, positioned in the (3) relevant health contexts, (4) emphasize actionable messages, and incorporate (5) persuasive campaign design Interestingly, while many participants indicated the importance of fear-appeal messages in persuading them to take health actions, some young adults also suggested avoiding fear campaigns due to discomfort Conclusions Insights of the study can inform seasonal influenza vaccination design and development, and have the potential to shed light on vaccination messaging in other vaccine contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccines Results also underscore the need for health experts and government officials to adopt a more nuanced approach when selecting persuasive campaign appeals While some young adults may resonate well with fear appeals, others may not Future research could examine the underlying mechanisms that drive young adults preference for vaccination campaign intervention to enrich the literature further","output":"Young adults preferences for influenza vaccination campaign messages: Implications for COVID-19 vaccine intervention design and development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES There are no head-to-head trials of different dose escalation strategies of methotrexate (MTX) in RA.

The effectiveness of the different shutdown measures in Germany during the second wave is assessed by the difference of weekly incidences before and after the respective time periods. FINDINGS: The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions of different extents resulted in four distinct time periods of complex, spatially diverse, and age-related spreading patterns during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Clustering gave three regions of coincident spreading characteristics. October 2020 showed a nationwide exponential growth of weekly incidence rates with a doubling time of 10 days. A partial shutdown during November 2020 decreased the overall infection rates by 20C40% with a plateau-like behaviour in northern and southwestern Germany. The eastern parts exhibited a further near-linear growth by 30C80%. Allover the incidence rates among people above 60 years still increased by 15C35% during partial shutdown measures. Only an extended shutdown led to a substantial decrease in incidence rates. These measures decreased the numbers among all age groups and in all regions by 15C45%. This decline until January 2021 was about -1?25 times the October 2020 growth rates with a strong correlation of -0?96. INTERPRETATION: Three regional groups with different dynamics and different degrees of effectiveness of the applied measures were identified. The partial shutdown was moderately effective and at most stopped the exponential growth, but the spread remained partly plateau-like and regionally continued to grow in a nearly linear fashion. Only the extended shutdown reversed the linear growth.

This study assessed the role of negative affectivity, right-wing authoritarianism, and anxiety of COVID-19 infection in explaining a variety of the maladjusted behaviors (i.e., China-phobic discrimination, panic buying) observed with an Italian sample. Specifically, we examined the effect of Negative Affectivity and Right-Wing Authoritarianism on maladjusted behaviors, and the moderating role of anxiety of infection. Seven hundred and fifty-seven Italian participants completed an online survey between March 3rd to the 7th 2020, which was immediately before the lockdown. A moderated-mediation model was tested using a structural equation modeling approach. Results indicated that both Negative Affectivity and Right-Wing Authoritarianism were positively associated with COVID-19-related maladjusted behavior, and that Right-Wing Authoritarianism mediated the relationship between Negative Affectivity and maladjusted behavior. Furthermore, the effect of Right-Wing Authoritarianism on maladjusted behavior was greater for those with high anxiety of infection, and the indirect effect of Negative Affectivity on maladjusted behavior through Right-Wing Authoritarianism was moderated by infection anxiety. Findings highlight potential psychological paths that may inform communication strategies and public health initiatives aimed at promoting healthy behavior during an outbreak.","output":"Negative Affectivity, Authoritarianism, and Anxiety of Infection Explain Early Maladjusted Behavior During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of March 11, 2021, 3,992,044 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 106,615 deaths (case fatality rate 2.67%) have been reported on the African continent. In March 2020, even before the first case of COVID-19 was registered, some African countries implemented total lockdown measures, which limited movement of people, banned mass gatherings, and closed schools and borders. However, these control measures, which affect individuals and society's well-being, cannot be implemented for a long time. There is an urgent need for a robust framework to guide African countries to make evidence-based decisions on easing these restrictive measures and reapply them when the infection rates increase significantly. This article presents a proposed framework to guide lockdown easing while limiting the community spread of COVID-19 in Africa. Due to lack of information on the impact of relaxing restrictions on peoples' movement on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19) and how businesses will respond, it is almost clear that there is no single grand lockdown exit strategy. African governments should develop flexible, iterative lockdown exit plans based on epidemiological disease data, economic indicators, and peoples' views to inform decisions, all of which are paramount for success. A phased approach of changes and willingness to adapt methods will allow governments to minimize the pandemic's adverse impact and respond accordingly as new control tools become available.","output":"A proposed framework to limit post-lockdown community transmission of COVID-19 in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This retrospective cohort analysis, reports the demographic data and early outcome of the first 500 patients who were admitted to a District General Hospital in South West London, UK and tested positive to COVID-19. The patients were admitted between 10 January and 10 April 2020; with the first COVID-19 positive diagnosis on 6 March. A surge in admissions started around the 15 March and peaked at the beginning of April. 56.8% of the admissions were male and 43.2% were female. The average age of the 500 admissions was 69.32 years (SD 19.23 years, range 1 week to 99.21 years). By the morning of 14 April 2020, 199 patients had been discharged (Female 89, Male 111), 163 patients had died (female 61, male 102) and 131 remained as in-patients (female 66, male 71). Fewer than one in twenty deaths occurred in patients below the age of 50 years, in either gender. Mortality rose dramatically, for both genders, after the age of sixty with males being almost twice as vulnerable to dying, as females, during the 7th decade. Males older than their mid-fifties were more likely to die than leave hospital. The same applied to females beyond their mid seventies. We did not see any evidence of a poorer outcome associated with a lower decile for Index of Multiple Deprivation or convincing evidence that any Ethnic minority groups were more likely to die than the White subgroups. When compared to the equivalent medical conditions, normally treated in the early spring, COVID-19 has an increased mortality, adversely affecting more men and an older population. The mean duration from admission to discharge was 11.29 days (SD 11.50 days). For admission to death, the mean interval was 11.72 days (SD 11.05 days). 62 of the 500 admissions required ventilator support. Of this subgroup, 71% were male and 29% were female. By the morning of the 14 April, no female over the age of 60 had left the intensive care unit alive and no male over the age of 50 had left the intensive care unit alive. At this time-point, 1.2% of the 500 admitted patients had returned alive from the intensive care units, following a period of ventilator support. This figure will rise if prolonged ventilator and renal support proves effective. While only providing a snapshot of a relatively small number of patients, reviewed over a short time period, from a small geographic area, the data supports the view that the younger members of society are less vulnerable to the adverse sequelae of COVID-19 infection and that any return to normal work and social activities should be considered initially for the individuals who are less than 40-50 years of age.

However, the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome revealed limitations in the existing systems of management of field epidemiologists and communicable diseases. METHODS: The present study aims to evaluate data on current states, administrative reports, and other literature on the field epidemiologist system that has been in place in South Korea for 16 years since 1999 and to suggest appropriate future improvements in this system. RESULTS: By suggesting methods to evaluate the field epidemiologist system and training programs and by suggesting ways for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct evaluations on its own, the present study provides supporting evidence for improvement of systems for training of experts in epidemiological investigations. Moreover, based on the findings, this study also suggests methods to systematically train experts in communicable diseases management and a sustainable system to establish the basis of and develop strategies for a systematic and phased management of field epidemiologist training programs.

Among the various methodologies, one way for doing so is to affinity select peptide ligands from a phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library and then to examine if the proteins that carry such peptide sequences interact with the target protein in the cell. With the protocols described in this chapter, a laboratory with skills in microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry can readily identify peptides in the library that bind selectively, and with micromolar affinity, to a given target protein on the time scale of 2 months. To illustrate this approach, we use a library of bacteriophage M13 particles, which display 12-mer combinatorial peptides, to affinity select different peptide ligands for two different targets, the SH3 domain of the human Lyn protein tyrosine kinase and a segment of the yeast serine/threonine protein kinase Cbk1. The binding properties of the selected peptide ligands are then dissected by sequence alignment, Kunkel mutagenesis, and alanine scanning.

In the pandemic situation, these patients are considered highly vulnerable to infectious complications due to their immunocompromised state. MATERIAL & METHODS: In this retrospective case series, the documents of solid cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized in Shariati hospital between 20 February and 20 April 2020, were evaluated. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and/or features of chest CT scan highly suggestive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 33 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included. Mean age was 63.9 years, and 54.5% of the patients were male. LDH level was significantly higher (1487.5  1392.8 vs. 932.3  324.7 U/L, P-value=0.016) and also serum albumin was significantly lower in non-survivors (3.6  0.5 vs. 2.9  0.6 g/dL, p-value=0.03).

The role of NETs in trauma and trauma-induced hypercoagulability is unknown. We hypothesized that trauma patients with accelerated thrombin generation would have increased NETosis and syndecan-1 levels. METHODS In this pilot study, we analyzed 50 citrated plasma samples from 30 trauma patients at 0 h (n = 22) and 6 h (n = 28) from time of injury (TOI) and 21 samples from healthy volunteers, for a total of 71 samples included in analysis. Thrombin generation was quantified using calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) and reported as lag time (LT), peak height (PH), and time to peak (ttPeak). Nucleosome calibrated (H3NUC) and free histone standardized (H3Free) ELISAs were used to quantify NETs. Syndecan-1 levels were quantified by ELISA. Results are presented as median [interquartile range] and Spearman rank correlations. RESULTS Plasma levels of H3NUC were increased in trauma patients as compared to healthy volunteers both at 0 h (89.8 ng/mL [35.4, 180.3]; 18.1 ng/mL [7.8, 37.4], p = 0.002) and at 6 h (86.5 ng/mL [19.2, 612.6]; 18.1 ng/mL [7.8, 37.4], p = 0.003) from TOI. H3Free levels were increased in trauma patients at 0 h (5.74 ng/mL [3.19, 8.76]; 1.61 ng/mL [0.66, 3.50], p = 0.002) and 6 h (5.52 ng/mL [1.46, 11.37]; 1.61 ng/mL [0.66, 3.50], p = 0.006). Syndecan-1 levels were greater in trauma patients (4.53 ng/mL [3.28, 6.28]; 2.40 ng/mL [1.66, 3.20], p < 0.001) only at 6 h from TOI. H3Free and syndecan-1 levels positively correlated both at 0 h (0.376, p = 0.013) and 6 h (0.583, p < 0.001) from TOI. H3NUC levels and syndecan-1 levels were positively correlated at 6 h from TOI (0.293, p = 0.041). TtPeak correlated inversely to H3 NUC (-0.358, p = 0.012) and syndecan-1 levels (-0.298, p = 0.038) at 6 h from TOI.

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","output":"Evidence for strong mutation bias towards, and selection against, U content in SARS-CoV-2: implications for vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With 6.1 million US cases as of early September 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is presenting unprecedented challenges to primary care.

The risks associated with the open technique without fluoroscopy have not yet been investigated, despite the palpable entry point and large bony corridor for rapid insertion in the limited time available for the management of unstable pelvic fracture patients. The aim of this study was to compare the open technique without fluoroscopy to the fluoroscopically assisted percutaneous technique for the positioning of supra-acetabular screws in cadavers without pelvic instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The open technique for half-pin placement was compared to standard fluoroscopic guidance in 16 hemipelves (8 cadavers). The open technique was first performed on one side in each cadaver after simple randomization, followed by standard fluoroscopic guidance on the other side. In the open technique group, a Schanz pin 5 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length was inserted in the area just above the anteroinferior iliac spine (AIIS) and aimed with a medial inclination of 20 and a cephalad inclination of 10-20 after a 2 cm pilot drill hole had been established. Standard fluoroscopically guided pin placement was performed on the other side. Fluoroscopic assessment was conducted after final pin placement on both sides. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (LFCN) and the hip capsule were identified via the Smith-Peterson approach. After complete dissection of soft tissue, it was clearly apparent that pin penetration was conducted outside the bony corridor. RESULTS: The LFCN was found to be in a risk zone near the pin (mean distance, 15 mm; range, 0-30 mm). One LFCN may have been injured in the fluoroscopic guidance group. The mean medial inclination of the pin was 19.8 (range, 5-40) and the mean cephalad inclination was 11.5 (range 0-20) in the open technique group. The mean medial inclination of the pin was 30.4 (range, 20-45) and the mean cephalad inclination was 19.3 (range, 2-35) in the fluoroscopic guidance group. The mean distance of the pin entry point from the AIIS was 11.1 mm (range, 0-35 mm) in the open technique group. The mean distance of the entry point of the pin from the AIIS was 15.1 mm (range, 0-25 mm) in the fluoroscopic guidance group. The mean hip joint capsule distance was 12 mm (range, 8-25 mm). No joint penetration was observed in the open technique group, compared to one joint penetration in the fluoroscopic guidance group. No sciatic notch penetration was found in either group, but pin penetration outside the external cortex of the ilium was found only in the open technique group, in 4 hemipelves.

Some adolescents are at risk to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic due to vulnerabilities in their social environment. In the present longitudinal study, we explored adolescents mood trajectories throughout the pandemic, and whether vulnerabilities in the social environment (i.e. household and socioeconomic hardship) predicted adolescents mental health directly and indirectly through feelings of uncertainty about the future. We also investigated whether executive functions and age buffered these relationships. In total, 177 Dutch-speaking adolescents aged 10 C 18 years (Mage = 15.64, SDage = 1.72, 80% females at T1) participated in all three waves (T1= May 2020, T2 = November 2020, T3 = May 2021) of an online survey. Mood results demonstrated that feelings of vigor stabilized, after an initial dip between T1 and T2, but that feelings of tension and depression continued to increase throughout the pandemic. Higher exposure to household and socioeconomic hardship predicted negative mood and lower life satisfaction and was mediated by feelings of uncertainty about the future. Irrespective of the exposure to household and socioeconomic hardship, adolescents with better executive functions reported better mood in the aftermath of the pandemic, partially due to lower feelings of future uncertainty. However, no associations were observed with life satisfaction. These novel findings imply that adolescents mental health issues may outlast the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOxl nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5x1O10 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D6146 virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9,2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years);1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid49 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.296) and in 19 of750 vaccine recipients (2.596), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval ICI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid49, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant;vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, 76.8 to 54.8).

However, various Russian translations of the AUDIT are known to be in use in different settings and, so far, little is known about the empirical basis and validation of the instrument in Russiaa country, which is known for its distinct drinking patterns and their detrimental impact on health. The present contribution is the summary of two systematic reviews that were carried out to inform a planned national validation study of the AUDIT in Russia. Two systematic searches were carried out to 1) identify all validation efforts of the AUDIT in Russia and to document all reported problems encountered, and 2) identify all globally existing Russian translations of the AUDIT and document their differences and any reported issues in their application. The qualitative narrative synthesis of all studies that met the inclusion criteria of the first search highlighted the absence of any large-scale rigorous validation study of the AUDIT in primary health care in Russia, while a document analysis of all of the 122 Russian translations has revealed 61 unique versions, most of which contained inconsistencies and signaled obvious application challenges of the test. The results clearly signal the need for a validation study of the Russian AUDIT.

The study aims to evaluate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in tears and conjunctival secretion of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY A prospective interventional case series study was performed, and 32 patients with COVID-19 were selected at the Pamukkale University Hospital from 15 to 22 May 2020. The tear and conjunctival samples were collected by a conjunctival swab. Each specimen was sent to the laboratory for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. To avoid cross-infection, gloves and personal protective equipment were changed after collecting each sample. RESULTS 32 patients (18 male, 14 female) with Covid-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. The average age of the patients was 52.81  16.76 years. By the time of the first collection of conjunctival-tear samples, the mean time of the onset of complaints was 6.84  6.81 (1-35) days. Tear-conjunctival samples from 5 patients (16%) without conjunctivitis yielded positive PCR results, 3 of whom had positive and 2 negative nasopharyngeal PCR results. CONCLUSIONS Five of 32 patients (16 %) without conjunctivitis or any eye symptoms had viral RNA in their tear-conjunctival samples. The possibility of transmission via tears and conjunctival secretions should be recognized even in the absence of conjunctivitis or other ocular manifestations.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the tears and conjunctival secretions of Coronavirus disease 2019 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater-based epidemiology uses pooled wastewater samples to monitor community health and has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to track SARS-CoV-2 RNA shed by infected individuals into wastewater. Wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been positively correlated with contemporaneous counts of COVID-19 cases, making it useful for following relative disease burden trends within a community. However, the statistical associations are too weak for wastewater-based epidemiology to reliably predict reported case counts, limiting its potential. Here we show that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are highly correlated with the community prevalence estimated from 8 randomized household community surveys in 6 Oregon communities over a 10-month period. We found that wastewater-based epidemiology is a significantly better predictor of COVID-19 community prevalence than reported case counts, which suffer from systematic biases including variations in access to testing and underreporting of asymptomatic cases, even after accounting for uncertainty inherent in the wastewater and prevalence estimates by using Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, our results show that wastewater-based epidemiology can identify the rise and fall of neighborhood-scale COVID-19 hot spots and provide rapid information about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants at the neighborhood- and city-scale through sequence analyses of the wastewater. These results validate the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology to be a quantitative method to predict the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identify the presence of variants of concern in a given community or neighborhood, independent of availability and access to individual-level testing. These advantages in combination with its scalability, relatively modest cost and low labor requirements, makes integrating permanent wastewater-based epidemiology infrastructure into public health systems a key component in creating pandemic-resilient cities in the future.","output":"Wastewater-based epidemiology predicts COVID-19 community prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Uncontrolled haemorrhage as a result of trauma remains a significant surgical challenge, accounting for approximately 25-40% of trauma-related mortality. A wide range of local internal haemostatic agents have been developed to help achieve intra-cavity control of bleeding, with choice of agent influenced by the circumstances and nature of the haemorrhage. Trauma patients are frequently coagulopathic, so products that incorporate pro-coagulant technology and thereby act independently of the clotting cascade may be more effective in these settings. A range of products that utilise thrombin and fibrinogen to promote local haemostasis at intra-cavity bleeding points are available or in development, including fibrin glues (e.g. Tisseel?/Tissucol? and Evicel?/Crosseal?/Quixil?), fibrin sealant patches (e.g. TachoSil?) and products based on a gelatin-thrombin haemostatic matrix (e.g. FloSeal?). MATERIALS AND METHODS This systematic review was performed to assess all peer-reviewed evidence of product efficacy. RESULTS Fibrin sealant patches have shown haemostatic efficacy in a variety of surgical procedures and appear to offer practical advantages over liquid fibrin glues. Existing evidence suggests that patch products enable delivery of pro-coagulants to defined areas with less chance of dilution and/or displacement by blood flow, but they require a pressure buttress for a suitable amount of time to achieve good results after trauma. CONCLUSIONS Our experience, supported by other reports in the literature, suggests the use of such fibrin patches may provide an effective option in helping to control haemorrhage after trauma. However, there is a general paucity of clinical data for intra-cavity haemostatic agent use, with the majority of data being based on animal models and case reports. Further clinical evidence, ideally including comparative studies between different agents, would be beneficial in helping guide surgeon choice to the most appropriate products to use in trauma settings.","output":"Use of local pro-coagulant haemostatic agents for intra-cavity control of haemorrhage after trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases.

METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations other than isolated anosmia and/or non-severe headache, and with no previous neurological or psychiatric disorders were prospectively included. Neurological examination was performed in all patients and lumbar puncture with CSF examination was performed when not contraindicated. Serum anti-gangliosides antibodies were tested when clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of the 349 COVID-19 admitted to our center between March 23rd and April 24th 2020, 15 patients (4.3%) had neurological manifestations and fulfilled the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. CSF examination was available in 13 patients and showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in 2 patients: 1 with anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (anti-Caspr2) antibody encephalitis and 1 with meningo-polyradiculitis. Increased serum titer of anti-GD1b antibodies was found in three patients and was associated with variable clinical presentations, including cranial neuropathy with meningo-polyradiculitis, brainstem encephalitis and delirium.

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of S?o Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students.

STIs and bloodborne viruses (BBVs) are over-represented in people experiencing broader health inequalities, which include those with mild learning disabilities. Self-managed care, including self-sampling for STIs/BBVs, is increasingly commonplace, requiring agency and health literacy. To inform the development of a partner notification trial, we explored barriers and facilitators to correct use of an STI/BBV self-sampling pack among people with mild learning disabilities. METHODS: Using purposive and convenience sampling we conducted four interviews and five gender-specific focus groups with 25 people (13 women, 12 men) with mild learning disabilities (JulyCAugust 2018) in Scotland. We balanced deductive and inductive thematic analyses of audio transcripts to explore issues associated with barriers and facilitators to correct use of the pack. RESULTS: All participants found at least one element of the pack challenging or impossible, but welcomed the opportunity to undertake sexual health screening without attending a clinic and welcomed the inclusion of condoms. Reported barriers to correct use included perceived overly complex STI/BBV information and instructions, feeling overwhelmed and the manual dexterity required for blood sampling. Many women struggled interpreting anatomical diagrams depicting vulvovaginal self-swabbing. Facilitators included pre-existing STI/BBV knowledge, familiarity with self-management, good social support and knowing that the service afforded privacy. CONCLUSION: In the first study to explore the usability of self-sampling packs for STI/BBV in people with learning disabilities, participants found it challenging to use the pack. Limiting information to the minimum required to inform decision-making, easy read formats, simple language, large font sizes and simpler diagrams could improve acceptability. However, some people will remain unable to engage with self-sampling at all. To avoid widening health inequalities, face-to-face options should continue to be provided for those unable or unwilling to engage with self-managed care.","output":"How can we make self-sampling packs for sexually transmitted infections and bloodborne viruses more inclusive?

Data on outcomes of such surveillance programs are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the resection rate and malignancy rate during follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS From our prospective database (2006-2015) of patients with pancreatic cysts, we analyzed patients with pancreatic cysts without high-risk stigmata with at least six months follow-up. RESULTS In total, 146 patients were followed for a median of 29 months (IQR 13.5-50 months). In 124 patients (84.9%), no changes in clinical or imaging characteristics occurred during follow-up. Thirteen patients (8.9%) developed an indication for surgery after a median follow-up of 25 months (IQR 12-42 months). Two patients did not undergo surgery because of comorbidity, 11 patients (7.5%) underwent resection. Indications for surgery were symptoms (n = 2), development of a pancreatic mass (n = 1), a new nodule (n = 2), thickened cyst wall (n = 1), pancreatic duct dilation (n = 3), and/or suspicion of mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) (n = 3). Postoperative histology showed one pancreatic malignancy not originating from the cyst, three mixed type-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), one side branch-IPMN, two MCN, one neuroendocrine tumor, one serous cystadenoma, one inflammatory cyst, and one lymphangioma. The highest grade of cyst dysplasia was borderline dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS Most neoplastic pancreatic cysts without high-risk stigmata at initial presentation show no substantial change during 1-4-year follow-up. Only 7.5% of patients underwent surgery and less than 1% of patients developed pancreatic malignancy.

In addition, extractable chemical additives from microplastics have been identified as an important toxicity pathway in the aquatic environment. However, currently, little is known about the effects of such additives on the soil environment. In this study on nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), we adopted an ecotoxicological approach to assess the potential effects of 13 different microplastics (0.001-1% of soil dry weight) with different characteristics and extractable additives. We found that poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fragments and polyacrylicnitrile (PAN) fibers show the highest toxicity, while high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) fragments induced relatively less adverse effects on nematodes. In addition, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) induced no toxicity within our test concentration range for the acute period. Acute toxicity was mainly attributed to the extractable additives: when the additives were extracted, the toxic effects of each microplastic disappeared in the acute soil toxicity test. The harmful effects of the LDPE films and PAN fibers increased when the microplastics were maintained in the soil for a long-term period with frequent wet-dry cycles. We here provide clear evidence that microplastic toxicity in the soil is highly related to extractable additives.

Secondary endpoints were 30-day overall mortality and the composite endpoint of requirement of hospital admission or need for supplemental oxygen during the 30-day follow-up period. A total of 127 patients (median age 70 years; 56.7% males) received BEC. Of those, 93 (73.2%) received BEC within 5 days from symptoms onset (early BEC).

We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains. Main Outcomes and Measures: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens. Results: The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions.

Epidemiological studies suggest that bats (Rhinolophus affinis) are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. By analyzing the conservation of five residues in two virus-binding hotspots of ACE2 (hotspot 31Lys and hotspot 353Lys), we predicted 80 ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. We chose 48 ACE2 orthologs among them for functional analysis, and showed that 44 of these orthologs-including domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria-could bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses.

We examined the association between home-and community-level characteristics and the risk of outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in retirement homes since the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 1 to Dec. 18, 2020. Our primary outcome was an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( 1 resident or staff case confirmed by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement homeC and community-level characteristics and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56 491 residents. There were 273 (35.5%) retirement homes with 1 or more outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, involving 1944 (3.5%) residents and 1101 staff (3.0%). Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 2487 (81.7%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) homes. The adjusted hazard of an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, were co-located with a long-term care facility, were part of larger chains, offered many services onsite, saw increases in regional incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were located in a region with a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

However, data on influenza vaccination in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are scarce. In this study, our goals were to: (1) measure vaccination coverage rates (VCRs) for influenza in a large cohort of children, adolescents, and adults with CHD; (2) identify patient characteristics as predictors for vaccination; and (3) investigate the effect of influenza vaccination on hospitalization. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study in Belgium included 16,778 patients, representing 134,782 vaccination years, from the Belgian Congenital Heart Disease Database Combining Administrative and Clinical Data (BELCODAC). Data over 9 vaccination years (2006-2015) were used, and patients were stratified into 5 age cohorts: 6 months to 4 years; 5-17 years; 18-49 years; 50-64 years; and 65 years and older. RESULTS: In the respective age cohorts, the VCR was estimated to be 6.6%, 8.0%, 23.9%, 46.6%, and 72.8%. There was a steep increase in VCRs as of the age of 40 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that higher anatomical complexity of CHD, older age, presence of genetic syndromes, and previous cardiac interventions were associated with significantly higher VCRs. Among adults, men had lower and pregnant women had higher VCRs. The association between influenza vaccination and all-cause hospitalization was not significant in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The influenza VCR in people with CHD is low, especially in children and adolescents. Older patients, particularly those with complex CHD, are well covered.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and mortality over 6 months in middle\\\\aged and older patients hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 and the association between acute morbidity severity and mortality across frailty strata. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Large academic medical center in Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1830 patients aged 50 years hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 (MarchCJuly 2020). MEASUREMENTS: We screened baseline frailty using the CFS (1C9) and classified patients as fit to managing well (1C3), vulnerable (4), mildly (5), moderately (6), or severely frail to terminally ill (7C9). We also computed a frailty index (0C1; frail >0.25), a well\\\\known frailty measure. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between frailty and time to death within 30 days and 6 months of admission. We also examined whether frailty identified different mortality risk levels within strata of similar age and acute morbidity as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years, 58% were male, and 27% were frail to some degree. Compared with fit\\\\to\\\\managing\\\\well patients, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval [CI]) for 30\\\\day and 6\\\\month mortality were, respectively, 1.4 (1.1C1.7) and 1.4 (1.1C1.7) for vulnerable patients; 1.5 (1.1C1.9) and 1.5 (1.1C1.8) for mild frailty; 1.8 (1.4C2.3) and 1.9 (1.5C2.4) for moderate frailty; and 2.1 (1.6C2.7) and 2.3 (1.8C2.9) for severe frailty to terminally ill.

Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7-10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7. Among these, 34 (3%) had test results that were positive, 940 (96%) had results that were negative, and three (<1%) had results that were indeterminate (Table). Among the 34 contacts who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on day 7 after exposure, 12 (35%) were asymptomatic.

We investigated change in each behaviour (pre/during the May 2020 lockdown), and differences by age/cohort, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic position (childhood social class, education attainment and adult financial difficulties). Logistic regression models were used, accounting for study design and non-response weights, and meta-analysis used to pool and test cohort differences in association. RESULTS: Change occurred in both directionsshifts from the middle part of the distribution to both declines and increases in sleep, exercise and alcohol use. Older cohorts were less likely to report changes in behaviours while the youngest reported more frequent increases in sleep, exercise, and fruit and vegetable intake, yet lower alcohol consumption. Widening inequalities in sleep during lockdown were more frequent among women, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and ethnic minorities. For other outcomes, inequalities were largely unchanged, yet ethnic minorities were at higher risk of undertaking less exercise and consuming lower amounts of fruit and vegetables.

SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to evaluate the quantity, size, and distance of droplets and splatter following each experimental condition. RESULTS: There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter noted in the measured surgical field in any direction after nasal endoscopy, septoplasty with microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty, cold-steel functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and all experimental conditions using an ultrasonic aspirator. Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, <1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, <1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, <1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter. The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm).

This new law replaced the previous line item budgeting, with a new program-based budgeting (PBB) process. This study examined the experience of health sector PBB implementation at the county level in Kenya. METHODS We carried out a systematic review of the literature documenting the health sector application and utility of PBB in low- and middle-income countries. We then collected empirical data to examine the experience of health sector application of PBB at County Level in Kenya. RESULTS In the financial year 2017/18, counties utilised the PBB approach for health sector planning. The PBB approach was perceived by keys stakeholders; to have improved the alignment of technical priorities with budgetary allocation, and to have increased transparency, accountability and openness of the process. Its challenges included lack of clear tools and guidelines to support implementation, low capacity at county level, political interference and the organisation of the public sector electronic financial management system around line item budgeting system. CONCLUSION PBB is potentially a useful tool for aligning health sector planning and budgeting and ensuring the Annual Work Plan is more result oriented. However, realisation of this goal would be enhanced by the developing clear tools and guidelines to support its implementation, building capacity for county health sector managers to better understand the PBB application, and reforming the public-sector budgetary management system to align it with the PBB approach.","output":"Examining health sector application and utility of program-based budgeting: County level experiences in Kenya."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The in vivo phenotypic profile of T cells reactive to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 antigens remains poorly understood.

The summary measure for active HCV infection was 19% (95% CI 15C25%) in studies carried out before 2001. For studies implemented after 2001, the corresponding summary measure was 9% (95% CI 6C13%). Heterogeneity was pervasive, but different analyses helped to identify its underlying sources. Besides the year each study was conducted, the findings differed markedly between geographic regions and were heavily influenced by the size of the studies and publication biases. Our systematic review and meta-analysis documented a substantial decline in HCV prevalence among Brazilian haemodialysis patients from 1992 to 2015. CKD should be targeted with specific interventions to prevent HCV infection, and if prevention fails, prompt diagnosis and treatment. Although the goal of HCV elimination by 2030 in Brazil remains elusive, it is necessary to adopt measures to achieve micro-elimination and to launch initiatives towards targeted interventions to curb the spread of HCV in people with CKD, among other high-risk groups. This is of particular concern in the context of a protracted COVID-19 pandemic and a major economic and political crisis.","output":"Persistently high hepatitis C rates in haemodialysis patients in Brazil [a systematic review and meta-analysis]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To (1) describe the distribution of Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 emergency funding to general practices in March and April 2020 and (2) consider whether further funding to general practices should be allocated differently to support equity for patients. METHODS Emergency funding allocation criteria and funding amounts by general practice were obtained from the MOH. Practices were stratified according to their proportion of high-needs enrolled patients (Mori, Pacific or living in an area with the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation). Funding per practice was calculated for separate and total payments according to practice stratum of high-needs enrolled patients. RESULTS The median combined March and April funding for general practices with 80% high-needs patients was 28% higher per practice ($36,674 vs $28,686) and 48% higher per patient ($10.50 vs $7.11) compared with the funding received by general practices with fewer than 20% high-needs patients. Although the March allocation did increase funding for high-needs patients, the April allocation did not. CONCLUSIONS Emergency support funding for general practices was organised by the MOH at short notice and in exceptional circumstances. In the future, the MOH should apply pro-equity resource allocation in all emergencies, as with other circumstances.","output":"Emergency COVID-19 funding to general practices in early 2020: lessons for future allocation to support equity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have opened the door for the classification of the human virome.

No single therapeutic agent can target all these pathophysiologic substrates. Moreover, the current therapies are not fully effective in reducing mortality in moderate and severe disease. Hence, we aim to evaluate the combination of drugs (aspirin, atorvastatin, and nicorandil) with anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, immunomodulatory, and vasodilator properties as adjuvant therapy in covid- 19. TRIAL DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective, two-arm parallel design, open-label randomized control superiority trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at the covid centre of Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College Tanda Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, India. All SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring admission to the study centre will be screened for the trial. All patients >18years who are RT-PCR/RAT positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with pneumonia but without ARDS at presentation (presence of clinical features of dyspnoea hypoxia, fever, cough, spo2 <94% on room air and respiratory rate >24/minute) requiring hospital admission and consenting to participate in the trial will be included. Patients with documented significant liver disease/dysfunction (AST/ALT > 240), myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (CPK > 5x normal), allergy or intolerance to statins, allergy or intolerance to aspirin, patients taking medications with significant interaction with statins, prior statin use (within 30 days), prior aspirin use (within 30 days), history of active GI bleeding in past three months, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100000/ dl), pregnancy, active breastfeeding, patient unable to take oral or nasogastric medications, patients in altered mental status, shock, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis and ARDS at presentation will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: After randomization, participants in the intervention group will receive aspirin, atorvastatin, and nicorandil (Fig. 1). Atorvastatin will be prescribed as 40 mg starting dose followed by 40 mg oral tablets once daily for ten days or till hospital discharge whichever is later. Aspirin dose will be 325 starting dose followed by 75 mg once daily for ten days or till hospital discharge whichever is later. Nicorandil will be given as 10 mg starting dose followed by 5mg twice daily ten days or till hospital discharge whichever is later. All patients in the intervention and control group will receive a standard of care for covid management as per national guidelines. All patients will receive symptomatic treatment with antipyretics, adequate hydration, anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin, intravenous remdesivir, corticosteroids (intravenous dexamethasone for 5 days or more duration if oxygen requirement increasing or inflammatory markers are raised), and oxygen support. Patients will receive treatment for comorbid conditions as per guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES: The patients will be followed up for outcomes during the hospital stay or for ten days whichever is longer. The primary outcome will be in-hospital mortality. Any progression to ARDS, shock, acute kidney injury, impaired consciousness, length of hospital stay, length of mechanical ventilation (invasive plus non-invasive) will be secondary outcomes. Changes in serum markers (CRP, D Cdimer, S ferritin) will be other secondary outcomes. The safety endpoints will be hepatotoxicity (ALT/AST > 3x ULN; hyperbilirubinemia), myalgiamuscle ache, or weakness without creatine kinase (CK) elevation, myositismuscle symptoms with increased CK levels (3-10) ULN, rhabdomyolysismuscle symptoms with marked CK elevation (typically substantially greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and with creatinine elevation (usually with brown urine and urinary myoglobin) observed during the hospital stay. RANDOMIZATION: Computer-generated block randomization will be used to randomize the participants in a 1:1 ratio to the active intervention group A (Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Nicorandil) plus conventional therapy and control group B conventional therapy only.

Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory proteins in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2s virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservations of nucleotides and so on.

The secondary purpose was to analyze the factors affecting patient satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data for 124 patients who had undergone surgical extraction of mandibular third molar under IVS using MDZ were retrospectively investigated in this case-control study. The initial dose of MDZ was determined by body mass index (BMI) and weight. In the case of insufficient sedation at the beginning of surgery, additional doses were injected. During surgery, peripheral oxygen saturation, bispectral index score (BIS), heart rate, and blood pressure were monitored and recorded. The predictor variables were sex, age, BMI, sleeping time ratio, dental anxiety, Pederson scale, and initial dose of MDZ. The outcome variables were additional administration of MDZ, observer's assessment of alertness/sedation, intraoperative amnesia, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were computed, and the P-value was set at 0.05. RESULTS Most patients had an adequate level of sedation with only the initial dose of MDZ and were satisfied with the treatment under sedation; however, 19 patients needed additional administration, and 13 patients were unsatisfied. In multivariable logistic analysis, lower age (odds ratio [OR], 0.825; P=0.005) and higher dental anxiety (OR, 5.744; P=0.003) were related to additional administration; lower intraoperative amnesia (OR, 0.228; P=0.002) and higher BIS right before MDZ administration (OR, 1.379; P=0.029) had relevance to patient dissatisfaction. CONCLUSION The preoperative consideration of age and dental anxiety is necessary for appropriate dose determination of MDZ in the minor oral surgery under IVS. The amnesia about the procedure affects patient satisfaction positively.","output":"Risk factor analysis of additional administration of sedative agent and patient dissatisfaction in intravenous conscious sedation using midazolam for third molar extraction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial reports of COVID-19 in December 2019, the world has been gripped by the disastrous acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.","output":"Parkinsonism as a Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the potential of traditional plant-based remedies (or phytomedicines) in the management of COVID-19, the present investigation was aimed at finding novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules by in silico screening of bioactive phytochemicals (database) using computational methods and drug repurposing approach. A total of 160 compounds belonging to various phytochemical classes (flavonoids, limonoids, saponins, triterpenoids, steroids etc.) were selected (as initial hits) and screened against three specific therapeutic targets (Mpro/ 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 by docking, molecular dynamics simulation and drug-likeness/ADMET studies.

In order to exclude prior exposure to the virus, only participants with negative serology to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were included. All controls developed a positive response to spike protein, while only 51 of 136 transplant recipients (37.5%) had positive serology (p < .001).

Activity-dependent transcriptional dynamics in neurons, however, have not been fully characterized, because most previous efforts relied on measurement of steady-state mRNAs.

We found pervasive transcriptional changes, in which ~45% of expressed genes respond to network activity shifts. Notably, the majority of these genes respond to increases or decreases of network activity uniquely, rather than reciprocally. We further linked the chromatin regulator Retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1), the Smith-Magenis Syndrome gene, to the specific transcriptional program driven by reduced network activity. Finally, we show that RAI1 is essential for homeostatic synaptic upscaling but not downscaling.

Therefore, a web-based questionnaire survey was conducted at the end of October 2020 for households in which any of the family members was a work from home worker. In regard to the changes in life schedule, work from home helped 21.5% of respondents to sleep 30 min more or even longer. This shows that the loss of commuting time to work due to work from home improved the health of respondents in terms of sleep. In terms of the changes in energy consumption, more than a quarter of households experienced an increase in electricity consumption. Around 40~50% of households whose monthly electricity consumption increased from last year were not aware of the reasons for the increase or realized it for the first time when they answered the questionnaire survey. This indicates that feedback using home energy management systems, etc., play an important role in promoting energy-saving behavioral changes. An analysis of the causes of the increase in energy consumption by households reveals that the increase in hours of use of air-conditioners is significantly correlated with the increase in household electricity consumption in August (p = less than 0.01). The large-scale questionnaire survey on Japanese housing during the COVID-19 pandemic in this study elucidated that work from home as a countermeasure against COVID-19 infection affected the residentslives and the energy consumption of each household.

The most common initial symptoms were fever (85.7%), cough (41.0%), fatigue (19.3%), muscle ache (17.4%), sputum production (14.9%), and there were six asymptomatic cases. 39 (24.2%) cases got infected in Shanghai, and three of them were second-generation cases of Shanghai native cases. The estimated median of the time from onset to first medical visit, admission, disease confirmation, and discharge for 161 cases was 1.0 day (95% CI, 0.6C1.2), 2.0 days (95% CI, 1.5C2.6), 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.6C5.7), 18.1 days (95% CI, 17.4C18.8), respectively. The estimated median of the time from admission to discharge was 14.0 days (95% CI, 13.3C14.6). The time from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghais first-level public health emergency response. In Cox regression model, the significant independent covariates for the duration of hospitalization were age, the time from onset to admission and the first-level public health emergency response. CONCLUSIONS: Local transmission had occurred in Shanghai in late January 2020. The estimated median of the time from onset to discharge of moderate COVID-19 was 18.1 days in Shanghai. Time intervals from onset to first medical visit, admission and disease confirmation were all shortened after the Shanghais first-level public health emergency response. Age, the first-level public health emergency response and the time from onset to admission were the impact factors for the duration of hospitalization.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 161 discharged cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion was reported to be effective in treating critically ill patients with COVID-19, and hydroxychloroquine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Herein, we reported a case receiving combination therapy with CP transfusion and hydroxychloroquine for the first time. CASE PRESENTATION: Laboratory findings showed high lactic acid level (2.1 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 48.8 mg/L), and low white blood cell count (1.96  109/L) in a 65-year-old Chinese man, who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. CP was intravenously given twice, and hydroxychloroquine was orally administrated for a week (0.2 g, three times a day). The lactic acid and C-reactive protein levels remained high (2.1 mmol/L and 73.23 mg/L, respectively), while the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation decreased to 86% with a low oxygenation index (OI, 76 mmHg) on day 4 after CP transfusion. His temperature returned to normal and the OI ascended above 300 on day 11. Moreover, the RNA test remained positive in throat swab, and computed tomography revealed severe pulmonary lesions on day 11 after admission.

The requirements of safe models of tourism in the time of COVID-19, avoiding crowded localities and providing individual types of accommodation, can largely be met in second homes. This study aims to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions impacted the usage patterns of second homes in terms of: (1) the number of visits and length of stay, (2) the purpose of the second-home utilisation. An integral part of the study was to recognise how these new and existing im/mobilities were determined by a range of personal, social, contextual, and relational factors. The data collected from direct interviews and online surveys was tested using sign and Wilcoxon tests, while the interactive classification tree (C&RT) model was used to explain the reasons for changing or maintaining an existing second-home usage pattern. The research results showed that for most second-home owners their home-usage pattern remained the same as in 2019. If it changed, it was more common to extend the stay by moving in, working at a distance, or commuting to work, rather than to shorten the stay at the second home.

I dispel this misconception by providing an account of communitarianism, properly understood. It is premised on the idea that we are partially constituted by our communal attachments, or constitutive communities, which are a source of value to our lives.

The aim of the present study was to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 days after ICU discharge in a cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and to compare it with an age and sex-matched sample from the general Italian and Finnish populations. Moreover, the possible associations between clinical, demographic, social factors, and HRQoL were investigated. METHODS: COVID-19 ARDS survivors from 16 participating ICUs were followed up until 90 days after ICU discharge and the HRQoL was evaluated with the 15D instrument. A parallel cohort of age and sex-matched Italian population from the same geographic areas was interviewed and a third group of matched Finnish population was extracted from the Finnish 2011 National Health survey. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential associations between the evaluated factors and HRQoL. RESULTS: 205 patients answered to the questionnaire. HRQoL of the COVID-19 ARDS patients was significantly lower than the matched populations in both physical and mental dimensions. Age, sex, number of comorbidities, ARDS class, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and occupational status were found to be significant determinants of the 90 days HRQoL. Clinical severity at ICU admission was poorly correlated to HRQoL. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related ARDS survivors at 90 days after ICU discharge present a significant reduction both on physical and psychological dimensions of HRQoL measured with the 15D instrument.

Digital adoption has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic;companies have been challenged to rapidly adapt to the constant evolution of consumer needs and expectations, leading to valuable insights into the advancement of green business practices and a consequent rethinking of their business model. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the major shifts in sustainable consumer behavior on the Romanian retail market within the context of the Green European Deal, and retailerspriorities in agilely adapting to these significant evolutions. Based on a comprehensive literature review on these major shifts and significant evolutions at the national and international levels, a quantitative study was carried out to evaluate the Romanian retail market and identify the major challenges faced by retailers in dealing with the new set of priorities. The data collection was conducted via a survey used in the retail environment, applied within a Romanian supermarket chain. The Romanian retail sector has a particular configuration, which may have an impact upon the studys generalizability. Located in Central and Eastern Europe at the crossroads of the EU, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Middle East, Romania is a leading destination for foreign direct investment, and it is recognized for the similarities of its distribution and sales channels, the range of its retail outlets, and the local retail market dominance on the Big Box segment by reputed major retailers. A spectacular evolution is recorded in Romanias e-commerce market, including from the point of view of the long-standing and memorable traditional relationship between Romania and China which was confirmed more recently by Romanian consumers who prefer to buy online from stores in China. Our consumer research provides retailers with deep consumer insights with regard to their priorities in their agile adaptation. According to our research, Romanian consumers are environmentally concerned consumers, displaying an increased awareness about the important role they play with respect to impacting sustainable production and consumption by adopting green purchase behavior. Our study also points to the fact that retailers, although faced with challenges in targeting consumers with customized messages to reinforce their brand perception on sustainability issues, do pay considerable attention to sustainability as a personal value embraced by consumers and are willing to focus on digitizing their business processes to enable new, sustainable business models.","output":"Major Shifts in Sustainable Consumer Behavior in Romania and RetailersPriorities in Agilely Adapting to It"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whilst writing this editorial I had a dream: someone was coming up the path, he didnt look obviously threatening in his dark suit walking briskly towards the door.

This study aims to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection among HCW from Portuguese hospitals. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we analysed data from HCW (all professional categories) from two central hospitals in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley and Centre regions of mainland Portugal between December 2020 and November 2021. VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratios by Cox models considering age group, sex, presence of chronic disease and occupational exposure to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as adjustment variables. Results: During the 11 months of follow up, the 2213 HCW contributed a total of 1950 person-years at risk and 171 SARS-CoV-2 events occurred. The COVID-19 incidence rate for unvaccinated HCW was 348.7 per 1000 person-years while for fully vaccinated HCW was 43.0 per 1000 person-years. We observed a VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of 73.9% (95% CI: 26.2-90.8%) for complete vaccination status. Conclusion: This cohort study found a high COVID-19 VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Portuguese HCW, which is in concordance with previous studies from other countries.

This underscores the need for high-level disinfection, especially considering the vulnerability of critical care patients and the risks posed by multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Enhanced cleaning practices employed by hospitals for environmental disinfection are not all equal. For this investigation, a hydrogen peroxide disinfection system was chosen due to its EPA approval against SARS-CoV-2 and its sporicidal efficacy. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy/ feasibility of a hybrid form of hydrogen peroxide (HHP fogging) compared to current disinfection practices (standard cleaning and enhanced UV-light cleaning) in a critical care setting. METHODS: From Dec '20-Jun '21 data were collected in 17 critical care patient rooms post-discharge. Samples were collected to evaluate HHP fogging versus standard and enhanced cleaning. Sampling followed each intervention: post-EVS standard cleaning, post-enhanced cleaning with UV-light, and post HHP fogging following standard/enhanced practices. Five preset high touch patient room locations were swabbed for aerobic colony counts (ACC) and enumerated for MDRO presence: toilet, phone, bed rail, touchscreen, sink countertop. Measurements included quantitative and qualitative counts (ACC, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swabs -measured in relative light units,RLU), hydrogen peroxide chemical indicators, and bacterial spore biological indicators(BIs, Geobacillus stearothermophilus). RESULTS: No difference was seen between standard cleaning and enhanced cleaning with UV light (mean ACC 7.16 and 6.35, respectively;p=0.186). HHP fogging reduced present ACC levels by 98% beyond current EVS post-discharge cleaning practices (mean ACC 0.137, p< 0.0001). MRSA instances were observed after standard and enhanced cleaning with UV light (mean ACC 0.178), no MRSA was detected after HHP fogging. ATP results showed an average 88% reduction post HHP fogging (mean RLU: post cleaning=9012, post HHP fogging=1109;p=0.014) and BIs confirmed a 6-log bacterial spore efficacy. CONCLUSION: HHP fogging resulted in successful elimination of MDROs and reduction in aerobic colony counts versus standard and UV-light cleaning.

METHODS: In April 2020, we surveyed online a national sample of US adults on their health attitudes and behaviors before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparisons were analyzed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: A total of 2,544 individuals completed the survey: 473 African-Americans, 282 Hispanics and 1,799 Caucasians responded. The mean ages of each group were 41.4  11 years, 38.0  11 years and 45.7  13 years, respectively. Before COVID-19, African-Americans were least likely to report they had trust in science (53% vs. 68% for Hispanics and 77% for Caucasians; p< .01) and government (16% vs. 27% and 28%; p< .01). After COVID-19, the percentage of African-Americans who had trust in science and government fell further to 44% (p< .01) and 9% (p< .01), respectively, and remained significantly lower than the other two groups. Twice as many African-Americans vs. Caucasians stopped following science and health news after COVID-19 (9% vs. 4%, p< .01). The percentage of African-Americans who reported anxiety about their health rose from 30% pre-COVID to 53% after the outbreak (p< .01), and the percentage who reported anxiety about their family members health rose from 35% to 61% (p< .01).

OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with anosmia and ageusia and the recovery from these symptoms in an ethnically diverse cohort. METHODS: Individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020 were eligible for the study. Randomly selected participants answered a telephone questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms with a focus on anosmia and ageusia. Additionally, relevant past medical history and data on the COVID-19 clinical course were obtained from electronic medical records. 486 patients were in the COVID-19 group and 103 were COVID-19-negative. RESULTS: Patients who were younger were more likely to report anosmia and/or ageusia (odds ratio (OR) for anosmia per 1-year increase in age: 098, 95%CI:0-97-099, p = 0003; for ageusia: 098, 95%CI:097-099, p = 0005) as were patients with lower eosinophil counts (OR for anosmia per 0.1-K/L increase in eosinophils: 002, 95%CI:0001-046, p = 001, for ageusia 010, 95%CI:001-097, p = 0047).

The direct use of HLT cells, without long-term cell culture and in vitro differentiation approaches, preserves main immune and structural cell populations, including the most susceptible cell targets for SARS-CoV-2; alveolar type II (AT-II) cells, while maintaining the expression of proteins involved in viral infection, such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147 and AXL.

Acetylcholine (ACh) secreted from non-neuronal sources, including lymphocytes, plays an important, albeit underappreciated, role in regulating immune-mediated inflammation. This study was designed to explore the role of ACh in acute viral infection and recovery. Using the murine model of influenza A, cholinergic status in the lungs and airway was examined over the course of infection and recovery. The results showed that airway ACh remained constant through the early stage of infection and increased during the peak of the acquired immune response. As the concentration of ACh increased, cholinergic lymphocytes appeared in the airway and lungs. Cholinergic capacity was found primarily in CD4 T cells, but also in B cells and CD8 T cells. The cholinergic CD4+ T cells bound to influenza-specific tetramers at the same frequency as their conventional (i.e., non-cholinergic) counterparts. In addition, they were retained in the lungs throughout the recovery phase and could still be detected in the resident memory regions of the lung up to two months after infection. Histologically, cholinergic lymphocytes were found in direct physical contact with activated macrophages throughout the lung. When ACh production was inhibited, mice exhibited increased tissue inflammation, altered lung architecture, and delayed recovery. Together, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role for ACh in the transition from active immunity to recovery and pulmonary repair following respiratory viral infection.","output":"Acetylcholine regulates pulmonary inflammation and facilitates the transition from active immunity to tissue repair during respiratory viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and associated \\"lockdown\\" measures on acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is unknown We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and wellbeing METHODS: In this observational study in Leicestershire, UK, patients with COPD under a secondary care clinic were recruited Exacerbation frequency in the first 6 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown was compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity and behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared with normal RESULTS: 160 participants were recruited (meansd age 67 38 1 years, 88 (55%) males, meansd forced expiratory volume in 1 s 3413% pred) 140 (88%) reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year Significantly more community managed exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 versus 99;p=0 026) The increase was a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34 4% versus 33 8%) DISCUSSION: During lockdown participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers and good adherence to shielding advice (all p&lt;0 001) A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p&lt;0 001) CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first 6 weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared with 2019 This was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and significant behavioural change","output":"COPD in the time of COVID-19: an analysis of acute exacerbations and reported behavioural changes in patients with COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Efficiency of care chain response and hospital reactivity were and are challenged for stroke acute care management during the pandemic period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in North-Eastern Italy (Veneto, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Trentino-Alto-Adige), counting 7,193,880 inhabitants (ISTAT), with consequences in acute treatment for patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data collection of patients admitted to stroke units eventually treated with thrombolysis and thrombectomy, ranging from January to May 2020 from the beginning to the end of the main first pandemic period of COVID-19 in Italy. The primary endpoint was the number of patients arriving to these stroke units, and secondary endpoints were the number of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy. Chi-square analysis was used on all patients; furthermore, patients were divided into two cohorts (pre-lockdown and lockdown periods) and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test differences on admission and reperfusive therapies. RESULTS: In total, 2536 patients were included in 22 centers. There was a significant decrease of admissions in April compared to January. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease of thrombectomy during the lockdown period, while thrombolysis rate was unaffected in the same interval across all centers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a decrease in admission rate of stroke patients in a large area of northern Italy during the lockdown period, especially during the first dramatic phase.

One reason could be varying and low antibody contents in a majority of plasma units hampering standardization and clinical efficacy. Besides, other plasma components unnecessarily transfused like coagulation factors might promote hypercoagulation seen in severe COVID-19 etiopathology.

Here, we report the results of the first two antibody donations performed at the University Hospital Dsseldorf. In both cases, immunoadsorptions were very well tolerated with no side effects. Collected and neutralized eluates were concentrated using tangential flow filtration increasing the concentration of immunoglobulins 10fold as compared to peripheral blood and leading to probably eight times more neutralizing antibodies than in one plasma unit.

Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. METHODS We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 05% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. FINDINGS Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 869 years (95% UI 867-872), and for men in Singapore, at 813 years (788-837) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. INTERPRETATION Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention program for immobile patients with stroke in China. DESIGN A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pre-test/post-test (before and after) study was undertaken from a health care perspective. SETTINGS Participants were recruited from 25 hospitals among six provinces or municipal cities in eastern (Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and Beijing municipal city), western (Sichuan province), and central (Henan province and Hubei province) China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 7,653 immobile stroke patients were included in our sample. Patients in routine care settings were recruited from November 2015 to June 2016, and the recruitment of the intervention group patients was from November 2016 to July 2017. METHODS To adjust for potential bias from confounding variables, the 1:1 propensity score matching yielded matched pairs of 2,966 patients in the routine care group and 2,966 patients in the intervention group, with no significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics between two groups. All patients were followed-up 3 months after enrolment in the study. Total healthcare costs were extracted from the hospital information system, with the health outcome effectiveness of the intervention program measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) instrument and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a time horizon of 3 months. RESULTS Compared to routine care, the intervention program decreased the total costs of stroke patients by CN4,600 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [-7050, -2151]), while increasing quality-adjusted life year 0.009 (95% CI: [0.005, 0.013]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 3 months was CN-517,011 per quality-adjusted life year (95% CI: [-1,111,442, -203,912]). Subgroup analysis reveals that both the health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness improved significantly for ischemic patients and tertiary hospitals patients while for hemorrhagic patients and non-tertiary hospital patients only the health-related quality of life improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this first cost-effectiveness analysis in immobile stroke patients provide evidence that an intervention program provided significant cost saving, but mainly in ischemic patients and tertiary hospital patients. Wider adoption of such programs may be a sensible approach to reducing the burden of stroke and for immobile patients more generally.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to improve the quality of nursing care among immobile patients with stroke in China: A multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread of viral airborne diseases is becoming a critical problem for human health and safety, not only for the common cold and flu, but also considering more serious infection as the current pandemic COVID-19 Even if the current heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems limit the disease transmission by air, the air filters are susceptible to microbial colonization In addition, viruses spread via droplets (aerosol) produced by direct or indirect contact with infected people In this context, the necessity of an efficient HVAC system, able to capture and inactivate viruses- and bacteria-rich aerosols, thus preserving a safe indoor air environment and protecting people, is of enormous importance The aim of this work is the assessment of the antiviral properties of a silver nanoclusters/silica composite coating deposited via co-sputtering technique on glass, on metallic fibre-based air filters as well as on cotton textiles The selected human respiratory viruses are: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the human rhinovirus (HRV) and the influenza virus type A (FluVA) The coated air filters show that the nanostructured coating develops a strong virucidal activity against RSV and FluVA, but not against the HRV","output":"Nanostructured composite coating endowed with antiviral activity against human respiratory viruses deposited on fibre-based air filters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Connected health is expected to introduce an improvement in providing healthcare and doctor-patient communication while at the same time reducing cost.

Anemia and blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of delirium. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness and safety of using IVIS in a prehabilitation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients 70 y who underwent abdominal surgery between November 2015 and June 2018 were included in this single-center prospective cohort study. All patients were prehabilitated; however, only anemic patients received a single dose of 1000 mg intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to increase preoperative hemoglobin levels (IVIS group). Nonanemic patients received standard care (SC). The hemoglobin levels (primary outcome) were assessed at the outpatient clinic visit, at admission, and at discharge. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, postoperative anemia, blood transfusion, complications other than delirium, and length of hospital stay. All outcomes were compared between the IVIS group and SC group. RESULTS Of all patients (n = 248), 97 anemic patients received IVIS (39%). Of the anemic patients, 50 patients (52%) had iron deficiency. Initial differences in hemoglobin concentrations between the IVIS group and SC group at T1 and T2 (7.2 versus 8.8; P < 0.001 and 7.4 versus 8.6; P = 0.023, respectively) were no longer present at discharge (6.6 versus 7.2; P = 0.35). No statistically significant differences were observed for all secondary outcomes between the IVIS group and the SC group. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS Adding IVIS to prehabilitation programs is safe and diminishes differences in these concentrations between preoperatively anemic and nonanemic patients. IVIS may be worthwhile as an additional component of prehabilitation programs.

Traditional or known risk factors for severe disease are well described, but there are limited data on risks for prolonged hospitalization and persistent symptoms. Our aims were to determine factors (clinical and microbiological) associated with (i) prolonged length of stay (LOS); (ii) persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks; (iii) bronchiectasis up to 24 months post\\\\hospitalisation; and (iv) risk of respiratory readmissions within 6 months. METHODS: Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were enrolled at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Standardized forms were used to record clinical data. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at enrolment to identify respiratory viruses and bacteria. RESULTS: The median age of 232 infants was 5 months (interquartile range 3C9); 65% male. On multivariate regression, our 12 point severity score (including accessory muscle use) was the only factor associated with prolonged LOS but the effect was modest (+3.0 hr per point, 95%CI: 0.7, 5.1, P = 0.01). Presence of cough at 3 weeks increased the odds of bronchiectasis (OR 3.0, 95%CI: 1.1, 7.0, P = 0.03). Factors associated with respiratory readmissions were: previous respiratory hospitalization (OR 2.3, 95%CI: 1.0, 5.4, P = 0.05) and household smoke (OR 2.6, 95%CI: 1.0, 6.3, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Increased severity score is associated with prolonged LOS in Indigenous children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. As persistent symptoms at 3 weeks post\\\\hospitalization are associated with future diagnosis of bronchiectasis, optimising clinical care beyond hospitalization is needed to improve long\\\\term respiratory outcomes for infants at risk of respiratory disease.

However, the molecular mechanism of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity remains unclear.

We identified four conserved regions located far apart in the sequence that fold into the catalytic domain, which exhibits structural similarity to that of the UDPCglucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Comparison with UDPCglucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase also revealed a putative donor substrate-binding site, and the functional requirements of critical residues in human GNPTAB were validated using GNPTAB-knockout cells.

Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states. Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2 binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.","output":"Exploring Conformational Transition of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Between Its Closed and Open States Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Risk perception is an important predictor of health-protective behaviors during pandemics.

After one year, the readers reviewed the same examinations with added subtraction images. Accuracy of the detection of residual/recurrent tumor and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR; for tumoral enhancement-to-liver, tumoral enhancement-to-ablation zone, and ablation zone-to-liver) were calculated with and without subtraction images and compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020 (during the time-period before the start of Unlock 1.0 in India on and from June 08, 2020), and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2 = 0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020).

Mild transient nasal symptoms (21/24) were the major side effects of positive CPT followed by moderate periorbital edema which occurred in 41% (10/24). One controlled asthmatic BT-sensitized subject developed wheezing and dyspnea during a positive CPT with Bt that cleared with inhaled albuterol (400 mcg). There were no reactions whatsoever of CPT in non-allergic subjects. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that Bt may cause allergic conjunctivitis in our population. In addition, CPT is a safe and reproducible test if standardized allergens are used.","output":"Conjunctival Provocation Test With Blomia tropicalis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose (a) a method for aggregating and processing age-stratified subregional time series data for positive tests of infection given partial sampling for variant-of-concern biomarkers, and (b) a simple model-based theoretical framework for interpreting these processed data, to assess whether observed heterogeneity in age-specific relative differences can be explained by environmental effects alone.

The roaring 1920s (equity and housing bubbles in the U.S.), the Feds unwarranted tight-money policy error to curtail speculative activities on Wall Street and to avoid a potential stock market crash (1929), and a severe economic recession with massive bank failures at the onset of the 1930s resulted in catchy economic jargons to be coined such as the Great Crash of 1929 and Great Depression of the 1930s. At the backdrop of no large-scale conflicts, the Cold War era (i.e. bipolarity and two superpowers) gave the dollar virus a rare opportunity to gain strength during the halcyon periods of economic growth (1950s and 1960s), but the Nixon shock (President Nixons decision to cut dollars link or convertibility to gold) caused the dollar virus to mutate into a more dangerous variant, the upshot of which was an epidemic (i.e. Latin American debt crisis) as the dollar virus began to infect major economies in Latin America through commercial banks short-term lending of the dollar glut from rich oil-producing countries to Latin American states. Risk insensitive rules of Basel I banking standard (released to banks in July 1988) aggravated the dollar virus and forced it to mutate into a more severe variant in the late 1990s which caused another epidemic in the East Asia and Pacific (Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), but this time was different than the antecedent, the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 in systemic nature (President Clinton called it a glitch) made investors lose $700 billion ($30 billion by Americans). The criticism and mounting pressure prompted the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the standard setter) to overhaul Basel I;contrary to the hyped optimism and promises, Basel II (Revised Framework) has made developing and emerging economies more crisis-prone. Thanks to the selfish America First policy, weaponization of the dollar, and abuse of the sanction power, now the dollar virus has reached a pandemic status with the objective of enslaving the humankind and bringing on the Armageddon. Although COVID-19 pandemic (Great Health Crisis C GHC) has killed over 6 million people worldwide, if not contained by designing of a new monetary order (no hegemony of one nation and one currency), the dollar virus as a weapon of vast economic destruction will take more lives, maybe by billions.","output":"Basel I & Basel II Have Aggravated the Man-Made Dollar Virus (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus has caused a global concern due to its infection rate and mortality. Despite extensive research, there are still no specific drugs or vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate some plant-based active compounds for drug candidacy against SARS-CoV-2 by using virtual screening methods and various computational analyses. A total of 27 plant metabolites were screened against SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins (MPP), Nsp9 RNA binding protein, spike receptor binding domain, spike ecto-domain and HR2 domain using a molecular docking approach. Four metabolites, i.e., asiatic acid, avicularin, guajaverin, and withaferin showed maximum binding affinity with all key proteins in terms of lowest global binding energy. The crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots were unravelled for each viral protein. The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases). Moreover, results of drug similarity prediction revealed two approved structural analogs of Asiatic acid i.e. Hydrocortisone (DB00741) (previously used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) and Dinoprost-tromethamine (DB01160) from DrugBank. In addition, two other biologically active compounds, Mupirocin (DB00410) and Simvastatin (DB00641) could be an option for the treatment of viral infections. The study may pave the way to develop effective medications and preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the encouraging results, we highly recommend further in vivo trials for the experimental validation of our findings.","output":"Screening and druggability analysis of some plant metabolites against SARS-CoV-2: An integrative computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic hepatitis B is often complicated with different degrees of hepatic fibrosis, which affects the quality of life.

But is well-being also served by social contact with people who are known less well? In this article, we discuss three propositions that support the conclusion that the benefits of social contact also derive from interactions with acquaintances and even strangers. The propositions state that most interaction situations with strangers are benign (Proposition 1), that most strangers are benign (Proposition 2), and that most interactions with strangers enhance well-being (Proposition 3). These propositions are supported, first, by recent research designed to illuminate the primary features of interaction situations. This research shows that situations with strangers often represent low conflict of interest. Also, in interactions with strangers, most people exhibit high levels of low-cost cooperation (social mindfulness) and, if the need is urgent, high levels of high-cost helping. We close by sharing research examples showing that even very subtle interactions with strangers yield short-term happiness. Broader implications for COVID-19 and urbanization are discussed.

Since their discovery in the late 1970's, DCs have been recognized as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs). DCs have a superior capacity for acquiring, processing, and presenting antigens to T cells and they express costimulatory or coinhibitory molecules that determine immune activation or anergy. For these reasons, cell-based therapeutic approaches using DCs have been explored in cancer and infectious diseases but with limited success. In humans, DCs are divided into heterogeneous subsets with distinct characteristics. Two major subsets are CD11c+ myeloid (m)DCs and CD11c- plasmacytoid (p)DCs. pDCs are different from mDCs and play an essential role in the innate immune system via the production of type I interferons (IFN). However, pDCs are also able to take-up antigens and effectively cross present them. Given the rarity of pDCs in blood and technical difficulties in obtaining them from human blood samples, the understanding of human pDC biology and their potential in immunotherapeutic approaches (e.g. cell-based vaccines) is limited. However, due to the recent advancements in cell culturing systems that allow for the generation of functional pDCs from CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), studying pDCs has become easier. In this mini-review, we hypothesize about the use of pDCs as a cell-based therapy to treat HIV by enhancing anti-HIV-immune responses of the adaptive immune system and enhancing the anti-viral responses of the innate immune system. Additionally, we discuss obstacles to overcome before this approach becomes clinically applicable.","output":"Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells as Cell-Based Therapeutics: A Novel Immunotherapy to Treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses cause recurring epidemic outbreaks every year associated with high morbidity and mortality.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who underwent tele-otology ear health screening in the Northern Territory, Australia between 2010 and 2018. INTERVENTIONS Otoscopic images were labeled by otolaryngologists to classify the ground truth. Deep and transfer learning methods were used to develop an image classification algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve (AUC) of the resultant algorithm compared with the ground truth. RESULTS Six thousand five hundred twenty seven images were used (5927 images for training and 600 for testing). The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 99.3% for acute otitis media, 96.3% for chronic otitis media, 77.8% for otitis media with effusion (OME), and 98.2% to classify wax/obstructed canal. To differentiate between multiple diagnoses, the algorithm achieved 74.4 to 92.8% accuracy and an AUC of 0.963 to 0.997. The most common incorrect classification pattern was OME misclassified as normal tympanic membranes. CONCLUSIONS The paucity of access to tertiary otolaryngology care for rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities may contribute to an under-identification of ear disease. Computer vision image classification algorithms can accurately classify ear disease from otoscopic images of Indigenous Australian children.

Here, applying neutralization tests to paired recoveree sera (N=38) of spring 2020 COVID-19 patients with clinical isolates of wildtype D614G and VoC1 and -2 strains (B.1.1.7 and B 1.351) from Finland, we show that NAbs of these patients are equally effective in inhibiting both contemporary and VoC1 strains whereas inhibition of VoC2 is reduced 8-fold (p<0.001) with 50% of sera failing to show NAbs. Our results align with an increased ability of VoC2 to reinfect previously SARS-CoV-infected populations.","output":"Reduced neutralization of B.1.351 variant SARS-CoV-2 by convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social isolation is a known predictor of mortality that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in the USA. Although experts began to recognize it as a public health crisis prior to 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic has accelerated recognition of social isolation as a serious threat to health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: Examine patient experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation in primary care settings, and whether patient experiences with these activities are associated with the severity of reported social isolation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N = 251) were recruited from 3 primary care clinics in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. MAIN MEASURES: A modified version of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI), endorsed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; items to assess for prior experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation. KEY RESULTS: In the sample population, 12.4% reported the highest levels of social isolation (SNI = 0/1), compared to 36.7%, 34.7%, and 16.3% (SNI = 2-4, respectively). Most patients had not been asked about social isolation in a healthcare setting (87.3%), despite reporting no discomfort with social isolation screening (93.9%). Neither discomfort with nor participation in prior screening for social isolation was associated with social isolation levels. Desire for assistance with social isolation (3.2%) was associated with a higher level of social isolation (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI, 1.3-28.8), as well as poor or fair health status (AOR = 9.1; 95% CI, 1.3-64.1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, few patients reported being screened previously for social isolation in a primary care setting, despite low levels of discomfort with screening. Providers should consider broadening social isolation screening and referral practices in healthcare settings, especially among sicker and more isolated patients who express higher levels of interest in assistance with social isolation.","output":"Patient Experiences with Screening and Assistance for Social Isolation in Primary Care Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared to genomic data of individual markers, haplotype data provide higher resolution for DNA variants, advancing our knowledge in genetics and evolution. Although many computational and experimental phasing methods have been developed for analyzing diploid genomes, it remains challenging to reconstruct chromosome-scale haplotypes at low cost, which constrains the utility of this valuable genetic resource. Gamete cells, the natural packaging of haploid complements, are ideal materials for phasing entire chromosomes because the majority of the haplotypic allele combinations have been preserved. Therefore, compared to the current diploid-based phasing methods, using haploid genomic data of single gametes may substantially reduce the complexity in inferring the donor's chromosomal haplotypes. In this study, we developed the first easy-to-use R package, Hapi, for inferring chromosome-length haplotypes of individual diploid genomes with only a few gametes. Hapi outperformed other phasing methods when analyzing both simulated and real single gamete cell sequencing datasets. The results also suggested that chromosome-scale haplotypes may be inferred by using as few as three gametes, which has pushed the boundary to its possible limit. The single gamete cell sequencing technology allied with the cost-effective Hapi method will make large-scale haplotype-based genetic studies feasible and affordable, promoting the use of haplotype data in a wide range of research.","output":"Inference of Chromosome-Length Haplotypes Using Genomic Data of Three or a Few More Single Gametes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measures to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have been concentrated on inviting people to stay at home This has reduced opportunities to exercise while also shedding some light on the importance of physical health Based on an online survey, this paper investigated physical activity behaviours of a Belgians sample (n = 427) during the lockdown period between the end of May 2020 and the beginning of June 2020 and found that, during this period, the gap between sufficiently and insufficiently active individuals widened even more This paper analysed important moderators of physical activity behaviours, such as barriers and benefits to exercise, digital support used to exercise, and individuals emotional well-being Descriptive analysis and analyses of variance indicated that, generally, individuals significantly increased their engagement in exercise, especially light- and moderate-intensity activities, mostly accepted the listed benefits but refused the listed barriers, increased their engagement in digital support and did not score high on any affective measures A comparison between sufficiently active and insufficiently active individuals during the lockdown showed that the former engaged even more in physical activity, whereas the latter exercised equally (i e , not enough) or even less compared to before the lockdown By means of a logistic regression, five key factors of belonging to the sufficiently active group were revealed and discussed Practical implications for government and policies are reviewed","output":"Physical Activity during the First Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigating the Reliance on Digital Technologies, Perceived Benefits, Barriers and the Impact of Affect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A major outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the Asia Pacific region. Some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region. METHODS: We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs. RESULTS: During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and 2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.","output":"Sentinel surveillance for human enterovirus 71 in Sarawak, Malaysia: lessons from the first 7 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe antibiotic susceptibilities for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among pediatric institutions in 2018. To assess correlations between antibiotic utilization and susceptibilities. METHODS Institutional antibiograms from 2018 were compiled among 13 institutions via a survey. Resistant pathogens and antibiotic days of therapy/1000 patient days (PD) were collected from 6 institutions over 5 years. Correlations were assessed as pooled data among all institutions and relative changes within individual institutions. RESULTS All 8552 S aureus isolates in 2018 were vancomycin susceptible and 40.1% were methicillin resistant (MRSA). Among MRSA, 96.3% and 78.8% were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin, respectively. Pooled yearly MRSA/1000 PD decreased from 2014-2018 and correlated with pooled yearly decreases in vancomycin utilization (R = 0.983, p = 0.003). Institutional relative decreases in vancomycin utilization from 2014-2018 did not correlate with institutional relative decreases in MRSA susceptibility (R = -0.659, p = 0.16). Susceptibility to meropenem was 90.9% among 2315 P aeruginosa isolates in 2018. Antipseudomonal beta-lactam susceptibility ranged from 89.4% to 92.3%. Pooled yearly meropenem-resistant P aeruginosa/1000 PD and meropenem utilization did not significantly decrease over time or correlate (both p > 0.6). Institutional relative change in meropenem utilization from 2013-2017 correlated with the institutional relative change in P aeruginosa susceptibility to meropenem from 2014-2018 (Rs = -0.89, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Among included institutions, the burden of MRSA decreased over time. Institutional MRSA prevalence did not consistently correlate with institutional vancomycin utilization. Institutional changes in meropenem utilization correlated with P aeruginosa susceptibility the following year. Pooled analyses did not illustrate this correlation, likely owing to variability in utilization between institutions.","output":"A Multicenter Analysis of Changes in Pediatric Antibiotic Susceptibilities Among Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates: 2014-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO just released in May 2022 a report on the state of the obesity pandemic in Europe, stating that 60% of citizens in the area of Europe are either overweight or obese, and highlighting the implications of the obesity pandemic, especially as it interacts with the COVID pandemic to create a twin pandemic, to increase morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a complex disease which has reached pandemic dimensions. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, mainly due to the adoption of a progressively more sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of less healthy diets. We first report herein updated prevalence rates of overweight and obesity by sex, age, and region first in Europe, per the WHO report, and then worldwide between 1980 and 2019, as we analyze and present herein the data provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study. The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men of any age and the prevalence of both overweight and obesity increases with age and has reached their highest point between the ages of 50 to 65 years showing a slight downward trend afterwards. The age-standardized prevalence of obesity has increased from 4.6% in 1980 to 14.0% in 2019. The American and European region have the highest obesity prevalence and the USA and Russia are the countries with the most obese residents. Given dire implications in terms of comorbidities and mortality, these updated epidemiological findings call for coordinated actions from local and regional governments, the scientific community and individual patients alike, as well as the food industry for the obesity pandemic to be controlled and alleviated. We can hopefully learn from the COVID-19 pandemic, where collaborative efforts worldwide, focused intense work at both the local and global level and well-coordinated leadership have demonstrated that humankind is capable of amazing accomplishments by leveraging science and public health, and that we can finally make strides in terms of understanding and combating the obesity pandemic and its dire comorbidities including diabetes, NAFLD, CVD and obesity associated malignancies.","output":"A 2022 update on the epidemiology of obesity and a call to action: as its twin COVID-19 pandemic appears to be receding, the obesity and dysmetabolism pandemic continues to rage on"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction-The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to significant strain on healthcaresystems worldwide.

Despite the several bedsides- to- bench investigations carried out by researchers all over the world to identify the best prophylactic and therapeutic options for this deadly virus, no novel vaccine or treatment drug has been developed. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV2) is associated with hyper inflammation characterized by excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. The hallmark of this unregulated inflammatory response includes viral sepsis, pneumonitis shock, coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. In the midst of cytokine storm and coagulopathy, anti-viral agents alone will not provide the much needed therapeutic effect. Hence, the need to combine anti-inflammatory agents such as interferons, angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE) 2 inhibitors, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and Janus kinase (JAK) family inhibitors, anticoagulants and other agents involved in inflammation resolution.

Delays in diagnostic procedures or in caring for many acute or chronic diseases can result in a dangerous increase in their severity with a consequent increase in short and long-term related mortality. This is evident both with regard to time-dependent acute diseases, such as coronary artery syndromes or cerebrovascular diseases, and chronic degenerative diseases such as neoplasms.

Despite the strong potential to alleviate existential distress through psychosocial interventions, existential distress and its impact on healthcare outcomes have not yet been studied systematically. We aim to investigate the frequency, longitudinal trajectory and predictive impact of existential distress on end-of-life outcomes. We further aim to determine patients and caregivers specific need for and utilisation of psychosocial support for existential distress. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study will consecutively recruit 500 patients with advanced cancer and 500 caregivers from oncological outpatient and inpatient clinics. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires (sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, existential distress, end-of-life outcomes, resources and support needs) at five points of assessment (at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). At baseline and 6-month follow-up, we will conduct structured diagnostic interviews to assess mental disorders. Statistical analyses will include descriptive statistics to determine the prevalence of existential distress, mental disorders and end-of-life outcomes; multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to calculate the predictive impact of existential distress on end-of-life outcomes; and growth mixture models to analyse longitudinal trajectories of existential distress. DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive knowledge about patients and caregivers existential concerns. The longitudinal empirical data will allow for conclusions concerning the frequency and course of existential distress throughout 1 year. This important extension of existing cross-sectional research will contribute to further develop targeted psychosocial interventions. Profiles of existential distress may be applied by clinicians from multiple professions and help to address existential concerns effectively.

PURPOSE: To report historical patterns of pharmaceutical expenditures, to identify factors that may influence future spending, and to predict growth in drug spending in 2022 in the United States, with a focus on the nonfederal hospital and clinic sectors. METHODS: Historical patterns were assessed by examining data on drug purchases from manufacturers using the IQVIA National Sales Perspectives database. Factors that may influence drug spending in hospitals and clinics in 2022 were reviewed-including new drug approvals, patent expirations, and potential new policies or legislation. Focused analyses were conducted for biosimilars, cancer drugs, generics, COVID-19 pandemic influence, and specialty drugs. For nonfederal hospitals, clinics, and overall (all sectors), estimates of growth of pharmaceutical expenditures in 2022 were based on a combination of quantitative analyses and expert opinion. RESULTS: In 2021, overall pharmaceutical expenditures in the US grew 7.7% compared to 2020, for a total of $576.9 billion. Utilization (a 4.8% increase), price (a 1.9% increase) and new drugs (a 1.1% increase) drove this increase. Adalimumab was the top drug in terms of overall expenditures in 2021, followed by apixaban, and dulaglutide. Drug expenditures were $39.6 billion (a 8.4% increase) and $105.0 billion (a 7.7% increase) in nonfederal hospitals and in clinics, respectively. In clinics and hospitals, new products and increased utilization growth drove growth, with decreasing prices for both sectors acting as an expense restraint. Several new drugs that are likely to influence spending are expected to be approved in 2022. Specialty and cancer drugs will continue to drive expenditures along with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: For 2022, we expect overall prescription drug spending to rise by 4.0% to 6.0%, whereas in clinics and hospitals we anticipate increases of 7.0% to 9.0% and 3.0% to 5.0%, respectively, compared to 2021.

This review discusses the role of cytokines and chemokines in SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with particular emphasis on the elevated levels of inflammatory mediators that are shown to be correlated with disease severity. For this purpose, we reviewed and analyzed clinical studies, research articles, and reviews published on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This review illustrates the role of the innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 and identifies the general cytokine and chemokine profile in each of the three infections, focusing on the most prominent inflammatory mediators primarily responsible for the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The current treatment protocols or medications in clinical trials were reviewed while focusing on those targeting cytokines and chemokines. Altogether, the identified cytokines and chemokines profiles in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 provide important information to better understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and highlight the importance of using prominent inflammatory mediators as markers for disease diagnosis and management. Our findings recommend that the use of immunosuppression cocktails provided to patients should be closely monitored and continuously assessed to maintain the desirable effects of cytokines and chemokines needed to fight the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.

These viruses come into contact with the airways either by direct projection, by secondary inhalation of airborne droplets, or by handling (fomites). The objective of this article is to clarify the mechanisms of production and penetration of droplets of secretions emitted during all expiratory phenomena likely to transport these viruses and come into contact with the respiratory mucosa. The droplets > 5 m follow the laws of ballistics, those < 5 m follow Brownian motion and remain suspended in the air. The aerosols of droplets are very heterogeneous whether the subject is healthy or sick. During an infectious period, not all droplets contain viral RNA. If these RNAs are detectable around patients, on surfaces, and in the ambient air at variable distances according to the studies (from 0.5 m to beyond the patients room), this is without prejudice to the infectious nature (viability) of the virus and the minimum infectious dose. There is a time lag between the patients infectious period and that of RNA detection for both viruses. Subsequently, the inhaled particles must meet the laws of fluid dynamics (filtration) to settle in the respiratory tree. All of this partly explains the contagiousness and the clinical expression of these two viruses from the olfactory cleft to the alveoli.","output":"The influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and the airways: clarification for the otorhinolaryngologist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) discovered in the last decade. Historically, these viruses have generated limited interest due to their inability to infect vertebrate cells. This viewpoint has changed in recent years because some ISFs have been shown to enhance or suppress the replication of medically important flaviviruses in co-infected mosquito cells. Additionally, comparative studies between ISFs and medically important flaviviruses can provide a unique perspective as to why some flaviviruses possess the ability to infect and cause devastating disease in humans while others do not. ISFs have been isolated exclusively from mosquitoes in nature but the detection of ISF-like sequences in sandflies and chironomids indicates that they may also infect other dipterans. ISFs can be divided into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The first group currently consists of approximately 12 viruses and includes cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus and Culex flavivirus. These viruses are phylogenetically distinct from all other known flaviviruses. The second group, which is apparently not monophyletic, currently consists of nine viruses and includes Chaoyang virus, Nounan virus and Lammi virus. These viruses phylogenetically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses despite their apparent insect-restricted phenotype. This article provides a review of the discovery, host range, mode of transmission, superinfection exclusion ability and genomic organization of ISFs. This article also attempts to clarify the ISF nomenclature because some of these viruses have been assigned more than one name due to their simultaneous discoveries by independent research groups.","output":"Insect-Specific Flaviviruses: A Systematic Review of Their Discovery, Host Range, Mode of Transmission, Superinfection Exclusion Potential and Genomic Organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs).

We explored attitudes of Israeli health-care-professionals (HCPs) towards the disclosure of challenging findings: variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), susceptibility loci (SL) for neurodevelopmental disorders and variants associated with adult-onset conditions. Particularly, we sought their views on providing parental choice regarding the disclosure of these findings. METHODS 29 in-depth interviews were conducted with genetic counselors (n=19), medical geneticists (n=4), medical geneticists that are trained in and practice fetal medicine (n=3) and fetal medicine experts (n=3). RESULTS Most participants (n=24) supported parental choice regarding uncertain genetic information. Engaging parents in disclosure decisions allows avoidance from potentially anxiety-provoking information, practicing parental autonomy and better preparation in cases where uncertain findings are identified. HCPs believed that given appropriate preparation, parents can make informed decisions. Four participants believed that disclosure should be based on professional judgement and one supported full-disclosure. Unlike VUS or SL, all interviewees agreed that in cases of medically actionable adult-onset conditions, the benefit of disclosure outweighs the damage. CONCLUSION HCPs attitudes are largely in-line with the Israeli practice of involving parents in disclosure decisions regarding uncertain information.

Phenolic compounds are known to have antiviral activity against many viruses such as HCV and HIV, through their phenol rings interaction with viral proteins and/or RNA, or via its regulating MAP kinase signaling in host cell defense. The present study aimed to assess polyphenolic compounds (gallic acid, quercetin, caffeine, resveratrol, naringenin, benzoic acid, oleuropein and ellagic acid) as COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (PDB ID 6M71) inhibitors, using a molecular docking. Molecular docking of these polyphenols were performed using Autodock 4.0 and Chimera 1.8.1 programs. Drug likeness and polyphenols pharmacokinetic properties were calculated using SWISSADME prediction website (http://www.swissadme.ch/). Remdesivir and ribavirin were used as standard antiviral drugs for comparison. Docking analysis results, ranked by binding energy value (G) of several tested ligands toward COVID-19 polymerase were;remdesivir > gallic acid > quercetin > caffeine > ribavirin > resveratrol > naringenin > benzoic acid > oleuropein > ellagic acid. The binding energies were -8.51, - 7.55, - 7.17, -6.10, - 6.01, - 5.79, - 5.69, - 5.54, - 4.94 and -4.59 kcal/mol, respectively. All tested polyphenols performed hydrogen bonds with one or two of the nucleotide triphosphate entry channel (NTP) amino acids in COVID-19 polymerase (ARG 555, ARG 555, LYS 545), except caffeine and oleuropein. Binding of polyphenols to NTP of COVID-19 polymerase may influence in the entry of the substrate and divalent cations into the central active site cavity, inhibiting the enzyme activity. It appears promising that, gallic acid and quercetin exhibited high binding affinity than ribavirin toward COVID-19 polymerase and expressed good drug likeness and pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, gallic acid and quercetin may represent a potential treatment option for COVID-19. Further researches are urgently required to investigate the potential uses of these polyphenols in COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, resveratrol, naringenin, benzoic and ellagic acid seem to have the best potential to act as COVID-19 polymerase inhibitors.","output":"Inhibition of COVID-19 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Natural Bioactive Compounds: Molecular Docking Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sensitive molecular assays are critical for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Here, we designed and evaluated two single-tube nested (STN) real-time RT-PCR assays, targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel and N genes. Both STN assays had a low limit of detection and did not cross react with other human coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. Using 213 initial respiratory specimens from suspected COVID-19 patients, the sensitivity of both the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and the STN COVID-19-N assays was 100% (99/99), while that of the comparator non-nested N assay was 95% (94/99). Among 108 follow-up specimens from confirmed COVID-19 patients who tested negative by the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, 28 (25.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the STN COVID-19-RdRp/Hel or the STN COVID-19-N assay. To evaluate the performance of our novel STN assays in pooled specimens, we created four sample pools, with each pool consisting of one low positive specimen and 49 negative specimens. While the non-nested COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive in only one of four sample pools (25%), both of the STN assays were positive in two of four samples pools (50%). In conclusion, the STN assays are highly sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Design and patients: Retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU for at least 24h at any of Emory Healthcare ICUs between March and April 2020. The comparison group was a cohort of all-cause sepsis patients prior to COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions: none. Measurements: Continuous waveforms were captured from the patient monitor. The EKG was then analyzed for each patient over a 300 second (s) observational window, that was shifted by 30s in each iteration from admission till discharge. A total of 23 HRV metrics were extracted in each iteration. We use the Kruskal-Wallis and Steel-Dwass tests (p < 0.05) for statistical analysis and interpretations of HRV multiple measures. Results: A total of 141 critically-ill COVID-19 patients met inclusion criteria, who were compared to 208 patients with all-cause sepsis. Demographic parameters were similar apart from a high proportion of African-Americans in the COVID-19 cohort. Three non-linear markers, including SD1:SD2, sample entropy, approximate entropy and four linear features mode of Beat-to-Beat interval (NN), Acceleration Capacity (AC), Deceleration Capacity (DC), and pNN50, were statistical significance between more than one binary combinations of the sub-groups (comparing survivors and non-survivors in both the COVID-19 and sepsis cohorts). The three nonlinear features and AC, DC, and NN (mode) were statistically significant across all four combinations. Temporal analysis of the main markers showed low variability across the 5 days of analysis, compared with sepsis patients. Conclusions: Heart rate variability is broadly implicated across patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and admitted to the ICU for critical illness. Comparing these metrics to patients with all-cause sepsis suggests a unique set of expressions that differentiate this viral phenotype. This finding could be investigated further as a potential biomarker to predict poor outcome in this patient population, and could also be a starting point to measure potential autonomic dysfunction in COVID-19.","output":"Changes in non-linear and time-domain heart rate variability indices between critically ill COVID-19 and all-cause sepsis patients -a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the rapid dissemination of papers and preprints investigating the disease and its associated virus, SARS-CoV-2.

However, despite increased attention on critical care capacity due to Covid-19, LMIC intensive care unit (ICU) capacity remains largely undescribed-especially in East Africa. We sought to characterize barriers to critical care capacity and delivery in Rwanda, hypothesizing that gaps in specialized personnel, training, and supervision ('human resources') would be perceived as more important limitations to high-quality ICU care compared to gaps in beds, medications, and diagnostics ('facilities, materials, equipment'). Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey of all hospitals with dedicated ICUs in Rwanda using a mixed-methods approach, adapting conceptual frameworks for health services evaluation in global disaster response and emergency medicine. Using World Health Organization (WHO)-developed benchmarks for facility-level surgery and trauma evaluations, we created a set of tools for ICU assessment. Questionnaires for physicians, nurses, trainee physicians, and hospital leadership were developed and pilot tested using REDCap software. Inventories of ICU and hospital capacity using an adapted WHO tool were undertaken at each site. Descriptive statistics including percentages, means, and standard deviations were performed. IRB approval was obtained though Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Rwanda. Results Four hospitals in Rwanda were identified with dedicated ICUs. Total ICU beds were 27 (5- 8), total annual ICU admissions were 1128. The majority (96%) of invited ICU medical staff completed the survey, including nurses (N=60), trainee physicians (N=29), and attending physicians (N=10). Complete inventories were obtained from all 4 hospitals. Respondents identified insufficient staffing (63%), equipment/bed shortages (40%), lack of training opportunities (36%), and inadequate supervision (23%) as key obstacles to providing high quality critical care. Both human resources (39%) and material resources (28%) were identified as key gaps. Inability to treat common critical illnesses was frequently reported. Inventories at the hospital level clearly identified resource constraints. Conclusions In this study, gaps in both material and human resources were perceived as limiting ICU care, in line with provider perceptions of inadequate care quality. Obstacles to change include material gaps, lack of training, and institutional barriers. Notably, health system leadership in Rwanda on multiple levels is aware of these gaps and challenges with specific plans to improve training, support, and availability of equipment and supplies.

This study deals with a novel patented polymer heat exchanger (WO2020049233A1) made of soft polyurethane tubes that are capable of oscillation once subjected to external forces. Laboratory tests coupled with theoretical analyses show a stable global heat transfer coefficient of 100-110 W/m(2)K, achieving 67-92% of the performance of titanium-, aluminum-, and copper-made heat exchangers with the same configuration. It further reveals that the performance of the soft heat exchanger can be enhanced by 30% when it is under oscillation. In addition, the external convective thermal resistance appears to be the dominant one instead of heat conduction through the wall material. The special operating condition of heat recovery from a sewer pipeline makes the polymer heat exchanger particularly adapted with its equivalent thermal performance but advantages of high flexibility, modularity, and low cost.","output":"Experimental characterization of a novel soft polymer heat exchanger for wastewater heat recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global health threat by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires an urgent deployment of advanced therapeutic options available.

We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen\\\\induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6\\\\week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER (T) :Zbtb7a (fl/fl) mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone.

Direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks, with virus shed in bat feces, urine, and saliva. An additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors. Despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, etc.) known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses, knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods.

DESIGN: Panel of observed public mask-wearing. SETTING: Counts of adult behavior in Marion County, Indiana, between November 15, 2020, and May 31, 2021. DETERMINANTS OF INTEREST: (1) Removal of state masking requirement; (2) introduction of the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness; (3) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation that vaccinated individuals did not need to wear masks in public; and (4) COVID-19 vaccine availability. OUTCOME: Percent observed with correct mask-wearing. ANALYSES: Fixed-effects models estimated the association between policies and mask-wearing. RESULTS: Ending Indiana's mask requirement was not associated with changes in correct mask-wearing. The CDC's recommendation was associated with a decrease of 12.3 percentage points in correct mask-wearing (95% CI, ?23.47 to ?1.05; P = .032).

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies directly comparing the minimally invasive surgical (arthroscopy or miniarthrotomy) and non-surgical treatment of ACL rupture with at least 10 years of follow-up in adult patients were included. RESULTS Five studies met the eligibility criteria. A meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of radiographic knee OA and a lower risk of secondary meniscal surgery for patients in the surgical group. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision and secondary ACL reconstruction was equal in the surgical and non-surgical groups. Knee laxity was lower among patients in the surgical group in four studies. No difference was found in the PROMs (ie, International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome, and Lysholm scores). CONCLUSION The risk of radiographic knee OA was higher, but the risk of secondary meniscal injury was lower 10 years after surgical treatment of ACL rupture. The risk of graft rupture/secondary ACL revision or secondary reconstruction was unrelated to treatment type. The degree of knee laxity was reduced after surgical treatment in comparison with non-surgical treatment, while PROMs were similar. However, due to the methodological challenges highlighted in this systematic review, these findings must be interpreted with caution.

Risks of individual prison outbreaks due to introduction of the virus and of widespread transmission within prisons due to poor conditions have been documented. We examine the additional risk potentially posed by transfer between prisons that can lead to large-scale spread of outbreaks across the prison system if the rate of transfer is sufficiently high. We estimated the threshold number of individuals transferred per prison per month to generate supercritical transmission between prisons, a condition that could lead to large-scale spread across the prison system. We obtained numerical estimates from a range of representative quantitative assumptions, and derived the percentage of transfers that must be performed with effective quarantine measures to prevent supercritical transmission given known rates of transfers occurring between California prisons. Our mean estimate of the critical threshold rate of transfers was 14.38 individuals transferred per prison per month in the absence of quarantine measures. Available data documents transfers occurring at a rate of 60 transfers per prison per month. At that rate, estimates of the threshold rate of adherence to quarantine precautions had mean 76.03%. While the impact of vaccination and possible decarceration measures is unclear, we include estimates of the above quantities given reductions in the probability and extent of outbreaks. We conclude that the risk of supercritical transmission between California prisons has been substantial, requiring quarantine protocols to be followed rigorously to manage this risk. The rate of outbreaks occurring in California prisons suggests that supercritical transmission may have occurred. We stress that the thresholds we estimate here do not define a safe level of transfers, even if supercritical transmission between prisons is avoided, since even low rates of transfer can cause very large outbreaks. We note that risks may persist after vaccination, due for example to variant strains, and in prison systems where widespread vaccination has not occurred.

In an option contract, the shipping company commits to order a quantity of containers from the leasing company and has the right to modify its order at a later stage, according to its actual requirement. Under this scheme, the shipping company is allowed to request a smaller or larger number of containers than the agreed initial order. This is done by buying an option premium in advance from the container leasing company. We present numerical results for different scenarios based on information provided by experts in the industry. For the purposes of comparison, a nonoption contract scheme is also evaluated. According to our numerical results, an option contract is better under a scenario where demand is normally distributed with a large standard deviation. This scenario is commonly observed in practice due to the dynamism and volatility of the shipping industry. We conclude that, under an option contract scheme, the shipping company has more flexibility to adjust its demand for containers and to be requested from the leasing company, and this adjustment is compensated by an option price determined according to variations in demand.","output":"An option contract model for leasing containers in the shipping industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relevance of the quality of parent-child interactions for child development has long been established.

Past studies reveal that grandparents provide their grandchildren with cariogenic foods and beverages (e.g., those with free sugars and/or modified starches). Qualitative research can help identify what drives this phenomenon. OBJECTIVES: To examine mothers' explanations for why grandparents in north central and central Appalachia give their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. DESIGN: A qualitative study on children's oral health in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from 2018-2020 was performed. In-person, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Qualitative data from interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then coded using NVivo. Data analysis for this study was performed using thematic analysis with iterative theme development. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: The participants were 126 mothers of children aged 3-5 years from West Virginia (n=66) and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (n=60). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mothers' perspectives about why grandparents give their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. RESULTS: In the study sample, 85% (n=107/126) of mothers named at least one of their children's grandparents as a member of their social network responsible for their children's oral health. From these interviews, 85% (n=91/107) of mothers discussed that grandparents gave their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. The mothers described four themes to explain why grandparents gave their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages: 1) Privilege of the grandparent role; 2) Responsibilities of the grandparent role; 3) Symbol of care and affection; and 4) Limited consideration or understanding of the detrimental impact. CONCLUSIONS: Grandparents play a role in giving their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages, which could potentially contribute to childhood caries.

The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological links between the outbreaks using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, including four non-outbreak (A1CA4) and three outbreak cases (A5CA7) in hospital A and eight cases (S1CS8) in hospital S. Patients' hospital stays, COVID-19 symptoms, and transfer history were reviewed. RNA samples were submitted for WGS and genome-wide single nucleotide variants and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. RESULTS: The index patient (A5) in hospital A was transferred from hospital S on 26 March. Patients A6 and A7 were the family caregiver and sister, respectively, of the patient who shared a room with A5 for 4 days. Prior to transfer, A5 was at the next bed to S8 in the emergency room on 25 March. Patient S6, a professional caregiver, took care of the patient in the room next to S8's room for 5 days until 22 March and then S5 for another 3 days. WGS revealed that SARS-CoV-2 in A2, A3, and A4 belong to clades V/B.2, S/A, and G/B.1, respectively, whereas that of A5CA7 and S1-S5 are of the V/B.2.1 clade and closely clustered. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 in patients A5 and S5 showed perfect identity. CONCLUSION: WGS is a useful tool to understand epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Nebulization is an aerosol-generating procedure, but little is known about the risks of MCT in the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol generation during MCT by using different delivery methods and to assess the impact of adding a viral filter. METHODS Seven healthy subjects performed simulated MCT in a near particle-free laboratory space with 4 different nebulizers and with a dosimeter. Two devices continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure, which detected ultrafine particles, from 0.02-1 m, and particles of sizes 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 m, respectively. Particle generation was compared among all the devices, with and without viral filter placement. RESULTS Ultrafine-particle generation during simulated MCT was significant across all the devices. Ultrafine-particle (0.02-1 m) concentrations decreased 77%-91% with the addition of a viral filter and varied significantly between unfiltered (P < .001) and filtered devices (P < .001). Ultrafine-particle generation was lowest when using the dosimeter with filtered Hudson nebulizer (1,258  1,644 particle/mL). Ultrafine-particle concentrations with the filtered nebulizer devices using a compressor were higher than particle concentrations detected when using the dosimeter: Monaghan (3,472  1,794 particles/mL), PARI (4,403  2,948), Hudson (6,320  1,787) and AirLife (9,523  5,098). CONCLUSIONS The high particle concentrations generated during MCT pose significant infection control concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Samples of 102 hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity were included in our observational cohort study. Patients were stratified according to the peak severity of COVID-19 disease in agreement with the World Health Organization ordinal scale. Twenty-six convalescent plasma donors with previous COVID-19 disease formed the control group. VWF:Ag concentration and VWF:CBA were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); ADAMTS13:Ac was determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Complement C3 and C3a were measured by turbidimetry and ELISA, respectively. Clinical covariates and markers of inflammation were extracted from hospital records. Results VWF:Ag and VWF:CBA were elevated in all groups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and increased in parallel with disease severity.

Immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, can also be generated by direct cellular reprogramming employing lineage-specific master regulators bypassing the pluripotent stage. Thus, the cellular reprogramming toolbox is now providing the means to address the potential of patient-tailored immune cell types for cancer immunotherapy. In parallel, development of viral vectors for gene delivery has opened the door for in vivo reprogramming in regenerative medicine, an elegant strategy circumventing the current limitations of in vitro cell manipulation. An analogous paradigm has been recently developed in cancer immunotherapy by the generation of CAR T-cells in vivo. These new ideas on endogenous reprogramming, cross-fertilized from the fields of regenerative medicine and gene therapy, are opening exciting avenues for direct modulation of immune or tumor cells in situ, widening our strategies to remove cancer immunotherapy roadblocks. Here, we review current strategies for cancer immunotherapy, summarize technologies for generation of immune cells by cell fate reprogramming as well as highlight the future potential of inducing these unique cell identities in vivo, providing new and exciting tools for the fast-paced field of cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Cell Fate Reprogramming in the Era of Cancer Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and the transmission chain of a family clustering of COVID-19 cases caused by severe acute respiratory 2019-nCoV Delta variant in Changping district of Beijing.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the medical protocols and outcome of patients who underwent HSCT during the pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical files of patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the era of COVID-19. The following data were reviewed for all patients: age, gender, primary disease, viral screening protocols for donors and recipients, COVID-19 status and outcome. The European society for blood and marrow transplantation (EBMT) guidelines were applied strictly on all of our patients, donors and bone marrow transplant unit staff. RESULTS: A total of 10 children were transplanted, 8 of them received allogenic transplant from matched donor and two patients received autologous transplant. Regarding allogenic transplants, all of our patients except two were transplanted as an emergency, 2 of them were Aplastic anemia, 2 patients were Fanconi anemia, one patient was Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and one patient was Acute myeloid leukemia. Only two patients were not an emergency as one of them had Thalassemia major and the other one was Sickle cell anemia. The autologous transplant was done for two patients with Neuroblastoma stage 4 as part of their treatment protocol. At a median follow up of 5.5 months (range, 2 month-7 months) two patients (20%) developed COVID-19, which was asymptomatic in both of them. One of our patients (10%) died due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia.

A total of 829 formulas, including 329 herbs from 189 ancient books, 131 formulas with 152 herbs, and 13 Chinese patent medicines (CPM) from 30 official Chinese prevention programs used in ancient epidemics, SARS, influenza and COVID-19 prevention, were reviewed and analyzed. Preventive CHM mainly has four functions and can be taken orally or applied externally. CHM that kill pathogens (Realgar [Xionghuang], Cyrtomium Fortunei J.

METHODS: Systematic analysis of all non-ICU patient hospitalizations for COVID-19 completing discharge between March 13 and May 1, 2020, in a large US health care system utilizing off-site central monitoring. Variables of interest were examined in relation to a composite event rate of death, ICU transfer, or increased oxygen requirement to high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Among 350 patients (age, 64  16 years; 55% male), most (73%) required 3 L/min or less of supplemental oxygen during admission. Telemetry was widely utilized (79%) yet arrhythmias were uncommon (14%) and were predominantly (90%) among patients with abnormal troponin levels or known cardiovascular disease. Ventricular tachycardia was rare (5%), nonsustained, and not associated with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin treatment. Adverse events occurred in 62 patients (18%), including 22 deaths (6%), 48 ICU transfers (14%), and 49 patients with increased oxygen requirement (14%) and were independently associated with elevated C-reactive protein (odds ratio, 1.09 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18; P = .04) and lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.006 per 1U/L; 95% CI, 1.001-1.012; P = .03) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Among non-critically ill patients hospitalized within a nonepicenter health care system, overall survival was 94% with the development of more severe illness or death independently associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase on admission.

Our IRB-approved study included 1367 serial CXRs from 405 adult patients (mean age 65  16 years) from two sites in the US (Site A) and South Korea (Site B). We recorded information pertaining to patient demographics (age, gender), smoking history, comorbid conditions (such as cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases), vital signs (temperature, oxygen saturation), and available laboratory data (such as WBC count and CRP). Two thoracic radiologists performed the qualitative assessment of all CXRs based on the RALE score for assessing the severity of lung involvement. All CXRs were processed with a commercial AI algorithm to obtain the percentage of the lung affected with findings related to COVID-19 (AI score). Independent t- and chi-square tests were used in addition to multiple logistic regression with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as output for predicting disease outcome and the need for mechanical ventilation. The RALE and AI scores had a strong positive correlation in CXRs from each site (r2 = 0.79-0.86; p < 0.0001). Patients who died or received mechanical ventilation had significantly higher RALE and AI scores than those with recovery or without the need for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). Patients with a more substantial difference in baseline and maximum RALE scores and AI scores had a higher prevalence of death and mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The addition of patients' age, gender, WBC count, and peripheral oxygen saturation increased the outcome prediction from 0.87 to 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for RALE scores and from 0.82 to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for the AI scores.

Objective: This study sought to define and identify patterns and insights into STD related discussions on Reddit over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We extracted posts from Reddit from March 2019 through July 2021. We used a machine learning text mining method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to conduct a text analysis to identify the most common topics discussed in the Reddit posts. We then used word clouds, qualitative topic labelling, and spline regression to characterize the content and distribution of topics observed. Results: Our extraction resulted in 24,311 total posts. LDA Coding showed that with 8 topics for each time period we achieved high coherence values (pre-COVID=0.41, pre-vaccine=0.42; post-vaccine=0.44). While most topic categories remained the same over time, the relative proportion of topics changed and new topics emerged. Spline regression revealed some key terms had variability in the percentage of posts that coincided with COVID-19 pre- and post- periods, while others were uniform across the study periods. Conclusions: Our studys use of Reddit is a novel way to gain insights into STD symptoms experienced, potential exposures, testing decisions, common questions, and behavior patterns (e.g., during lock down periods). For example, reduction in STD screening may result in observed negative health outcomes due to missed cases, which also impacts onward transmission. As Reddit use is anonymous, users may discuss sensitive topics with greater detail, and more freely than in clinical encounters.

This study investigated the association between the status of essential metals, vitamins, and antioxidant enzyme activities in COVID-19 patients and disease severity. We recruited 155 patients, who were grouped into four classes based on the Adults guideline for the Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 at King Faisal Specialist & Research Centre (KFSH&RC): asymptomatic (N = 16), mild (N = 49), moderate (N = 68), and severe (N = 22). We measured serum levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), vitamin D(3), vitamin A, vitamin E, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Among the patients, 30%, 25%, 37%, and 68% were deficient in Se (< 70.08 g/L), Zn (< 0.693 g/mL), vitamin A (< 0.343 g/mL), and vitamin D(3) (< 20.05 g/L), respectively, and SOD activity was low. Among the patients, 28% had elevated Cu levels (> 1.401 g/mL, KFSH&RC upper reference limit). Multiple regression analysis revealed an 18% decrease in Se levels in patients with severe symptoms, which increased to 30% after adjusting the model for inflammatory markers. Regardless of inflammation, Se was independently associated with COVID-19 severity. In contrast, a 50% increase in Cu levels was associated with disease severity only after adjusting for C-reactive protein, reflecting its possible inflammatory and pro-oxidant role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We noted an imbalance in the ratio between Cu and Zn, with ~ 83% of patients having a Cu/Zn ratio > 1, which is an indicator of inflammation. Cu-to-Zn ratio increased to 45% in patients with mild symptoms and 34%C36% in patients with moderate symptoms compared to asymptomatic patients. These relationships were only obtained when one of the laboratory parameters (lymphocyte or monocyte) or inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) was included in the regression model. These findings suggest that Cu/Zn might further exacerbate inflammation in COVID-19 patients and might be synergistically associated with disease severity. A 23% decrease in vitamin A was seen in patients with severe symptoms, which disappeared after adjusting for inflammatory markers. This finding may highlight the potential role of inflammation in mediating the relationship between COVID-19 severity and vitamin A levels. Despite our patients low status of Zn, vitamin D(3), and antioxidant enzyme (SOD), there is no evidence of their role in COVID-19 progression. Our findings reinforce that deficiency or excess of certain micronutrients plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

DESIGN: Inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Clinical settings across the USA in April and May of 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians with leadership and/or clinical roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASURES: Emergent themes related to professional roles and relationships. RESULTS: Sixty-one clinicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Study participants were practising in 15 states across the USA, and the majority were White physicians from large academic centres. Three overlapping and inter-related themes emerged from qualitative analysis of interview transcripts: (1) disruption: boundaries between work and home life became blurred and professional identity and usual clinical roles were upended; (2) constructive adaptation: some clinicians were able to find new meaning in their work and described a spirit of collaboration, shared goals, open communication and mutual respect among colleagues; and (3) discord and estrangement: other clinicians felt alienated from their clinical roles and experienced demoralising work environments marked by division, value conflicts and mistrust.

RESULTS: From March 17, 2020 to November 30, 2020, 2804 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The incidence of VTE and ATE was 7.6% and 3.9%, respectively. The incidence of VTE, but not ATE, was higher in patients receiving recent anti\\\\cancer therapy. A simplified RAM for VTE was derived and named CoVID\\\\TE (Cancer subtype high to very\\\\high risk by original Khorana score +1, VTE history +2, ICU admission +2, D\\\\dimer elevation +1, recent systemic anti\\\\cancer Therapy +1, and non\\\\Hispanic Ethnicity +1). The RAM stratified patients into two cohorts (low\\\\risk, 0C2 points, n = 1423 vs. high\\\\risk, 3+ points, n = 1034) where VTE occurred in 4.1% low\\\\risk and 11.3% high\\\\risk patients (c statistic 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.63C0.71). The RAM performed similarly well in subgroups of patients not on anticoagulant prior to admission and moderately ill patients not requiring direct ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID\\\\19 have elevated thrombotic risks. The CoVID\\\\TE RAM for VTE prediction may help real\\\\time data\\\\driven decisions in this vulnerable population.","output":"The CoVID\\\\TE risk assessment model for venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports on the treatment of a patient with nightmares who was treated with doxazosin of an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists.

We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.","output":"Cervical screening during the COVID-19 pandemic: optimising recovery strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An analysis of the 61,817 tasks performed by developers working on 45 projects, implemented using Team Software Process, is documented via a conversation between a data analyst and the person who collected, compiled, and originally analyzed the data.

This model can be used to simultaneously classify and localize the images to identify the species of the gender of field-caught mosquitoes. The results indicated that the concatenated two YOLO v3 model exhibited the optimal performance in identifying the mosquitoes, as the mosquitoes were relatively small objects compared with the large proportional environment image.

We also evaluated the underlying causes of recurrent stroke according to d-dimer levels. METHODS A total of 1431 patients with undetermined source were enrolled in this study and divided into quartiles according to their baseline plasma d-dimer levels. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of recurrent stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in the year following the stroke event. RESULTS The risk of recurrent stroke increased significantly with the increasing d-dimer quartile (log-rank P=0.001). Patients in the higher d-dimer quartiles had a higher probability of recurrent embolic stroke because of covert atrial fibrillation, hidden malignancy, or undetermined sources. Most recurrent strokes in Q3 and Q4 were embolic but not in Q1 or Q2. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients in Q3 and Q4 had a significantly increased risk of recurrent stroke compared with those in Q1 (hazard ratio, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.07-9.07], P=0.036; hazard ratio, 7.29 [95% CI, 2.59-20.52], P<0.001, respectively; Ptrend<0.001). Binary analyses showed a significant association between a high d-dimer level above normal range and the risk of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.31-4.70], P=0.005). In subgroup analyses, a high d-dimer level was associated with a significantly higher risk of recurrent stroke in men than in women (P=0.039).

This review aims to examine the evidence for such a link, specifically between acute, self-limiting infection and major depression, and to summarize the current understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this link. METHODS Relevant articles were sourced via an online search of published literature from Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed using a variety of search terms including mood disorder, depression, infection and inflammation. Additionally, a search for articles from the bibliographies of retrieved papers was conducted. RESULTS Findings from retrospective studies suggest an association between infection and subsequent mood disturbance, including major depression. This association has been confirmed by studies employing prospective observational or experimental challenge designs. The available evidence supports a multifactorial basis of vulnerability towards major depression in the context of acute infection. Genetic, neuroendocrine, autonomic and psychosocial factors may interact to potentiate the likelihood of a severe and prolonged depressive response to an immunological stressor in some individuals. CONCLUSION Mood disturbance is likely to have a host-protective role in the context of an acute sickness response to infection. However, this usually adaptive and reversible response may progress in some vulnerable individuals into a more sustained and severe pattern of behavioural and physiological changes of major depression. Further research is needed to delineate the factors that predispose, precipitate and perpetuate depression in the context of acute infective illness.

The objective of the study was to prove whether ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol for the successful induction of general anesthesia. The ideal post-induction sedation level was assessed by comparing patients' clinical symptoms and their hemodynamic effects in responding to noxious stimuli, mostly tracheal intubation and bispectral index (BIS) alterations following ciprofol/propofol administration. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial, selective surgery patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg (n = 88) or propofol 2.0 mg/kg (n = 88) groups. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with successful anesthesia inductions. Secondary endpoints included the times to successful induction of general anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex, changes in BIS, as well as safety indicators. RESULTS The anesthesia induction success rates for both ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg groups were 100.0%, with a 95% CI lower success limit of -4.18% difference between the two groups, indicating that ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol. For secondary outcomes, the average time to successful anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex were 0.91 min and 0.80 min for ciprofol and 0.80 min and 0.71 min for propofol, respectively. The pattern of BIS changes with ciprofol was similar to propofol and stable during the anesthesia maintenance period. Safety was comparable with 88.6% TEAEs in the ciprofol group compared to 95.5% in the propofol group. The incidence of injection pain was significantly lower in the ciprofol group compared to the propofol group (6.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.05). In addition, the patients treated with ciprofol had a lesser increase in blood pressure and heart rate, and fewer cases with BIS > 60 within 15 min of intravenous administration, which indicated that ciprofol may provide a better ideal sedation level during the post-induction period under an equivalent dosing regimen to propofol.

Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants' actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. OBJECTIVE The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). METHODS A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). RESULTS For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11).

We also aimed to validate a recently proposed method of estimation of the physiological dead space (VD(physiol)/V(T)) without measurement of expired CO(2). METHODS: Thirteen patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio < 100 mmHg were included in the study. Plateau pressure (Pplat), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), blood gas analysis and expiratory CO(2 )were recorded with patients in the supine position and after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours in the PP. Responders to PP were defined after 15 hours of PP either by an increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio > 20 mmHg or by a decrease in PaCO(2 )> 2 mmHg. Estimated and measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios were compared. RESULTS: PP induced a decrease in Pplat, PaCO(2 )and VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and increases in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios and compliance of the respiratory system (Crs). Maximal changes were observed after six to nine hours. Changes in VD(alv)/V(T )were correlated with changes in Crs, but not with changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratios. When the response was defined by PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio, no significant differences in Pplat, PaCO(2 )or VD(alv)/V(T )alterations between responders (n = 7) and nonresponders (n = 6) were observed. When the response was defined by PaCO(2), four patients were differently classified, and responders (n = 7) had a greater decrease in VD(alv)/V(T )ratio and in Pplat and a greater increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio and in Crs than nonresponders (n = 6). Estimated VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios significantly underestimated measured VD(physiol)/V(T )ratios (concordance correlation coefficient 0.19 (interquartile ranges 0.091 to 0.28)), whereas changes during PP were more reliable (concordance correlation coefficient 0.51 (0.32 to 0.66)).

There were no significant differences in mild and moderate disease courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection between liver transplant recipients and non-liver transplant pediatric patients (18 [90.0%] vs 133 [71.1%] patients [P = .188] and 2 [10%] vs 49 [26.2%] patients [P = .118], respectively). Fever was less frequently observed in liver transplant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with non-liver transplant patients (55.0% vs 80.2%; P = .015). We found no intergroup differences in sex (P = .342), hospitalization rate (P = .161), and overall clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the immunosuppression regimens, liver transplant patients in our series survived SARS-CoV-2 infection without serious sequelae and without graft rejection. Overall, liver transplant and non-liver transplant pediatric patients with SARSCoV-2 infection experienced a mild disease course.","output":"Clinical Features and Outcomes Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pediatric Liver Transplant Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until now, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remained to be an enormous threat for global health. As one viral illness induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), versatile, rapid and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in early stage is urgently needed. Here, we reported an ultrasensitive and visual in-one-tube detection method which could be accomplished within half an hour from sampling-to-result. By integrating all reactions in one tube, liquid handling steps were omitted and amplicon contamination could be totally avoided. Magnetic beads were employed to achieve the fast extraction of viral nucleic acid and increase the sensitivity. Using portable thermocycler and blue light, the fluorescent results could be directly observed by naked eyes. The proposed method is of higher specificity and sensitivity, nearly at single molecule level. More important, results demonstrated 100% positive detection rate for 40 clinical samples, which was consistent with standard RT-PCR. Thus, our method is considerably simple, rapid, sensitive and accurate, holding great promise for the instant detecting of viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and the next generation of molecular diagnosis. Graphical We proposed an ultrasensitive, instant and visual detection method termed as VIR-CRISPR for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Yet, the future holds some of the greatest public health challenges in mankinds history. Global disparities in health; medication safety; climate change; epidemics of obesity and diabetes; an aging world demographic; and emerging infections all represent problems requiring scientific solutions. The solutions to these problems, like the solutions to those in the last century that contributed so greatly to our quality of life, will require paradigm-shifting innovation. To maximize individual innovative potential, one strategy is formal instruction in the methods of innovative thinking. Teaching innovative thinking is rarely integrated into science training. However 40 years of accumulated evidence suggests that formal instruction results in improved thinking skills. I describe here some of the methods integrated into a course for graduate and professional health science students entitled Innovative Thinking. The curriculum consists of three components: recognizing and finding alternatives to habitual cognitive patterns; learning to use tools that enhance idea generation and originality; and harmonizing divergent thinking with the process of convergent thinking that is central to the scientific method. To build more innovative environments, institutions can promote team science, fund staged scientific designs that are heavy on early prototypes, reward and grow the training programs of past innovators, and become less risk averse. Although public health has accomplished much, it must continue to battle major, growing causes of disease and disability. Innovation is the engine of scientific discovery.

Firstly by a flooding of hospital resuscitation services, as well as of the call platforms for emergency services. The strict lockdown of the French population decreed on March 17, 2020 has also completely changed the conditions for seeking healthcare. Purpose The aim of our study was to give a first estimation of the impact of lockdown during the Covid19 crisis on the use of hospital emergency departments for the management of three groups of acute cardiovascular diseases: ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and pulmonary embolism (PE) Methods The French hospital emergency departments OSCOUR network daily collects 93 % of national ED visits, which are transmitted each day to the French public health agency. The weekly number of visits and the proportion of hospitalization following these visits between January 1, 2019 and April 12, 2020 were compared with the same weeks of 2019. Results During the first month of lockdown, the number of visits and hospitalizations after visits decreased by 35 % for IHD, 27 % for stroke, and 28 % (visits) and 18 % (hospitalizations) for PE compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was even higher during the first three weeks of lockdown. The proportion of hospitalizations after visits was high and increased slightly for IHD (+3 %) and for stroke (+2 %), and markedly for PE (+8 %). Conclusion These preliminary data show a major impact of Covid19 lockdown on the management of acute cardiovascular diseases with a likely delay for treatment. This could lead to an increase in cardiovascular sequelae and mortality in the following months. Data on hospitalization and healthcare expenditure should complete this first analysis to have a more precise estimation of the loss of chance caused by this crisis for patients not affected by covid19.","output":"Impact of covid19 crisis on the emergency management of cardiovascular diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work was a structured virtual screening for marine bioactive compounds with reported antiviral activities which were subjected to structure-based studies against SARS-CoV-2 co-crystallized proteins.

Using public information, we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city jail system from 20142020, paying special attention to what happened during the week of March 2329, 2020, immediately following the mayors order. In concordance with de Blasios stated policy, we find that being discharged during this focus week is associated with a lower probability of readmission as compared to being discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. Furthermore, comparing the individuals discharged during the focus week of 2020 to those discharged during the same calendar week in previous years, we find that the former group was, on average, slightly older than the latter group, although the difference is not large. Additionally, the individuals in the former group had spent substantially longer in jail than those in the latter group. With the release of long-serving individuals demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, the reduction would be over 50%. Because our results are only as accurate as New York Citys public-facing jail data, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements related to the incarcerated individuals age, gender, race, and more. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. One such reform might involve identifying and discharging low-risk individuals sooner in general, which might be feasible given the de Blasio administrations actions during the early stages of COVID-19.","output":"New York City jails: COVID discharge policy, data transparency, and reform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the increasingly widespread use of video consultations, there are very few documented descriptions of how to set up and implement video consultations in real-time practice.

These neurological symptoms are thought to be caused by brain inflammation, triggered by the virus infecting the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients, however we still dont fully understand the mechanisms for these symptoms. The neurological effects of COVID-19 share many similarities to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons in which the presence of cytotoxic protein-based amyloid aggregates is a common etiological feature. Following the hypothesis that some neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may also follow an amyloid etiology we performed a bioinformatic scan of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, detecting peptide fragments that were predicted to be highly amyloidogenic. We selected two of these peptides and discovered that they do rapidly self-assemble into amyloid. Furthermore, these amyloid assemblies were shown to be highly toxic to a neuronal cell line.

Fever can be measured contactlessly using an infrared sensor, but there are currently no systems for measuring the respiration rate in a similarly fast and contactless way. Therefore, we propose an RGB-camera-based method to remotely determine the respiration rate for the triage in hospitals.

Finally, the respiration rate is computed using Welchs power spectral density estimate. Our contactless approach is focused on a fast measurement and computation.

Patients were divided into 3 types based on Chinese guideline: mild (patients with minimal symptoms and negative CT findings), common, and severe-critical (patients with positive CT findings and different extent of clinical manifestations). CT visual quantitative evaluation was based on summing up the acute lung inflammatory lesions involving each lobe, which was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%), respectively. The total severity score (TSS) was reached by summing the five lobe scores. The consistency of two observers was evaluated. The TSS was compared with the clinical classification. ROC was used to test the diagnosis ability of TSS for severe-critical type. RESULTS: This study included 78 patients, 38 males and 40 females. There were 24 mild (30.8%), 46 common (59.0%), and 8 severe-critical (10.2%) cases, respectively. The median TSS of severe-critical-type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). The ICC value of the two observers was 0.976 (95% CI 0.962-0.985). ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918. The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of clinical mild-type patients with COVID-19 was relatively high; CT was not suitable for independent screening tool. The CT visual quantitative analysis has high consistency and can reflect the clinical classification of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: a? CT visual quantitative evaluation has high consistency (ICC value of 0.976) among the observers. The median TSS of severe-critical type group was significantly higher than common type (p < 0.001). a? ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TSS for diagnosing severe-critical type was 0.918 (95% CI 0.843-0.994). The TSS cutoff of 7.5 had 82.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. a? The proportion of confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal chest CT was relatively high (30.8%); CT was not a suitable screening modality.","output":"CT image visual quantitative evaluation and clinical classification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appropriate nurse staffing to provide high-quality care was a hot topic before the pandemic challenged healthcare organizations across the nation.

We conducted the first study aiming to estimate and compare the relative risk of secondary attack rates (SARs) of COVID-19 in different contact environments. Until 26 July 2021, epidemiological studies and cluster epidemic reports of COVID-19 were retrieved from SCI, Embase, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM in English and Chinese, respectively. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated in pairwise comparisons of SARs between different contact environments using the frequentist NMA framework, and the ranking of risks in these environments was calculated using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Subgroup analysis was performed by regions. Thirty-two studies with 68 260 participants were identified. Compared with meal or gathering, transportation (RR 10.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43C77.85), medical care (RR 11.68, 95% CI 1.58C86.61) and work or study places (RR 10.15, 95% CI 1.40C73.38) had lower risk ratios for SARs.

We sought to investigate body surface temperatures in feedlot wethers supplemented with ractopamine or zilpaterol and exposed to heat stress for 18 d. Corneal and skin temperatures were assessed via infrared thermography at 1 and 2-m distances. Rectal temperatures and circulating leukocytes, metabolites, and electrolytes were also measured. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures in unsupplemented and zilpaterol-supplemented lambs but not in ractopamine-supplemented lambs. Heat stress also increased (P < 0.05) surface temperatures of the cornea, nose, ear, and back, regardless of supplement. Observations were comparable between thermography performed at 1 and 2 m, and higher emissivity settings generally produced less variation. Heat stress tended to increase (P = 0.08) blood monocytes in unsupplemented but not ractopamine or zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Granulocytes were increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress in ractopamine-supplemented lambs but decreased (P < 0.05) in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol did not differ among groups, and blood lactate was reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs only. Blood Na + was reduced (P < 0.05) and Ca 2+ increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress, regardless of supplement.

One observed driver of a culture of wellness is perceived appreciation. The authors identified several contributors to perceived appreciation among faculty at a large, metropolitan academic institution through use of a novel survey. METHODS The authors surveyed clinical faculty in five departments: psychiatry, emergency medicine, internal medicine, thoracic surgery, and radiology. Two open-ended response questions assessed sources of perceived and lack of perceived appreciation in narrative form. The authors also collected data on gender and department identity. Grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the narrative responses and design thinking to brainstorm specific recommendations based on the main themes identified. RESULTS A total of 179 faculty respondents filled out the survey for an overall response rate of 29%. Major drivers of perceived appreciation were patient and families (42%); physician, trainee and non-physician colleagues (32.7%); chairs (10%); and compensation (3.3%). Major drivers of perceived lack of appreciation were disrespect for time and skill level, including inadequate staffing (30%); devaluation by a physician colleague, chief of one's service or the chair (29%); poor communication and transparency (13%); and patient and family anger (6%). CONCLUSIONS Opportunities to improve perceived appreciation include structured communication of patient gratitude, community building programs, top of licensure initiatives and accountability for physician wellness, and inclusivity efforts from organizational leaders.","output":"Understanding Perceived Appreciation to Create a Culture of Wellness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies distinctly. Particularly after severe or critical courses, i.e., after hospitalization, clinical manifestations frequently persist after the acute phase. However, symptoms may also persist after initially milder courses that can be treated in an outpatient setting. For patients who remain symptomatic after COVID-19, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended. However, only few studies investigated the effectiveness of PR, especially considering different disease courses. The main objective was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of post-COVID-19 PR. Methods: A total of 120 post-COVID-19 patients who were referred to the Bad Reichenhall Clinic between April 2020 and January 2021 were asked to participate in this prospective observational study. PR was tailored to each patients individual needs and was based on the current recommendations. The primary outcome dyspnea was assessed with numerical rating scales and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale. Secondary outcomes included other symptoms such as cough and sputum;physical capacity;lung function;fatigue;quality of life (QoL);depression;and anxiety. Furthermore, patients rated the overall effectiveness of PR and their subjective change in health status. Results: A total of 108 patients (mean age 55.610.1 years, 45.4% female) were included and were assigned to 3 groups depending on the referral mode (A: severe acute;B: severe after interval, C: mild after interval). At the end of PR, we detected improvements in the intensity of exertional dyspnea, physical capacity, QoL, fatigue, and depression in the overall group, with large effect sizes (Cohens d >0.8). Moderate effect sizes (0.5 d <0.8) were found for resting dyspnea and the mMRC-dyspnea scale. Cohens d >0.4 was found for vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, partial oxygen pressure, and anxiety. Significant but rather small effect sizes (0.2< d <0.4) were found for cough, sputum, pain, and other lung function parameters. Conclusions: PR is feasible, safe, and effective after acute COVID-19, which was true for all 3 groups analyzed, with a trend toward greater efficacy after severe courses of COVID-19 and an earlier start of PR after acute COVID-19. Therefore, all post-COVID-19 patients who remain symptomatic should be offered PR.Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00023180.

The results showed that the bachelors thesis defense was a stressful event for double-degree students, showing an activation of the sympathetic nervous system and presenting a higher autonomic habituation response for the double degree students compared to the single degree students. We found higher mean grades during the whole degree and higher grades in the written and oral bachelors thesis academic achievements for single-degree students compared to double-degree students. No significant differences were found between single-degree and double-degree students in subjective distress perception and cortical arousal. No correlation was found between academic performance variables and subjective distress perception, cortical arousal, and autonomic modulation variables. We conclude that the bachelors thesis defense produces a large anticipatory anxiety response in single-degree physiotherapy students and in double-degree sport sciences and physiotherapy students. Double-degree students showed higher levels of habituation and adaptability to the stressful event, with a better autonomic response.

The study aim was to investigate current SHI coverage and patients perspectives on this transition. METHODS: A survey of 1348 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (aged 18 years) was conducted at an HIV outpatient clinic at a central-level hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October and November 2018. Insurance coverage, reasons for not having a SHI card, perceived concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered local health facilities, and willingness to continue regularly visiting the current hospital were self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze factors associated with not having a SHI card and having concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered hospitals/clinics. RESULTS: SHI coverage was 78.0%. The most frequently reported reason for not having a SHI card was that obtaining one was burdensome, followed by lack of information on how to obtain a card, and financial problems. Most patients (86.6%) had concerns about receiving HIV services at SHI-registered local health facilities, and disclosure of HIV status to neighbors and low quality of HIV services were the main concerns reported. Participants aged < 40 years old and unmarried were more likely to report lack of SHI cards, and women and those aged 40 years were more likely to have concerns. However, 91.4% of patients showed willingness to continue regular visits to the current hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Although SHI coverage has been rapidly improving among HIV patients, most participants had concerns about the current system transition in Vietnam. In response to their voiced concerns, strengthening the link between higher-level and lower-level facilities may help to ensure good quality HIV services at all levels while mitigating patients worries and anxieties.","output":"The patient voice: a survey of worries and anxieties during health system transition in HIV services in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Traditional, instructor led, in-person training of CPR skills has become more challenging due to COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained endovascular lower extremity database of all patients with below-knee popliteal interventions from 2004 to 2012. Patient demographics, angiographic findings, interventions, primary and secondary patency, limb loss, and mortality were recorded. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier life-table and multivariate analysis, with P < .05 indicating significance. RESULTS There were 221 patients (56% male) with below-knee popliteal/P3 artery lesions. Mean age was 73  11.2 years. Claudication was present in 22% and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 78%. Mean lesion length was 10  8.5 cm, with 45% having total occlusions. Treatment included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without a stent (47%), atherectomy (ATH) with or without PTA/stent (52%), and stenting with PTA and ATH (3%). Complications included embolization (0.4%), hematoma (2.7%), pseudoaneurysm (1.3%), and dissection (7%). Freedom from restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4) was 65% at 1 year. Independent predictors of restenosis were CLI (hazard risk [HR], 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-9.9) and stenting combined with PTA and ATH (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01-7.4). Primary assisted and secondary patencies were 95% and 85% at 1 year. ATH with PTA had lower short-term restenosis in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients (95% vs 78% at 4 months). Limb loss was 18% at 4 years. Mortality was 24% at 4 years. Statin use was protective against primary restenosis (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.67) and death (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28-1.0). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular intervention for lesions involving the below-knee popliteal artery is a safe and effective therapy for claudication and CLI. Diabetic patients benefit most from ATH with PTA.

These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for caregivers logistically. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the telephone during the patient's transitional care period (time when the stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online sessions. METHODS: The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with repeated measures. We will enroll 240 caregivers from eight Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants randomized into the intervention arm receive a modified problem-solving intervention that uses telephone and web-based support and training with interactive modules, fact sheets, and tools on the previously developed and nationally available Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers' Understanding and Empowerment Caregiver website. In the usual care group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line, self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers' burden, knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and changes in stroke survivors' functional abilities and health care use. The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators, barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention. Throughout all phases of the study, we will collaborate with members of an advisory panel. RESULTS: Study enrollment began in June 2015 and is ongoing. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021.

METHODS: Women with breast cancer (n = 385) were assessed for changes in EI over ten times, from prior to, through 12 months after breast cancer surgery. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct EI profiles. RESULTS: Three distinct EI profiles (i.e., None C 26.2% (n = 101), Low C 42.6% (n = 164), High C 31.2% (n = 120)) were identified. Compared to the None and Low groups, patients in the High group were more likely to be younger. Higher proportions in the High group were non-White, pre-menopausal prior to surgery, had more advanced stage disease, had received an axillary lymph node dissection, had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, had received adjuvant chemotherapy, and had a re-excision or mastectomy on the affected breast within 6 months after surgery. In addition, these patients had lower quality of life scores. Compared to the None group, the High group had higher levels of trait and state anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and sleep disturbance and lower levels of cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new knowledge regarding EI profiles among women in the year following breast cancer surgery. The non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., younger age, being non-White, having more advanced stage disease) can inform current screening procedures. The potentially modifiable risk factors can be used to develop interventions to improve employment outcomes of breast cancer patients.

Aim: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home healthcare and research environment. Approach: First, the specific changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. Results: New efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a good potential for future growth. Conclusions: The biomedical optics community has a potentially large role to play in developing, testing, and commercializing new wearable and RPM technologies to meet the changing healthcare and research landscape in the COVID-19 era and beyond.","output":"Perspective on the increasing role of optical wearables and remote patient monitoring in the COVID-19 era and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus had a profound physiological and psychological burden with regards to contracting the disease or uncertainties in the care of infected patients.

SETTING: East Hararghe Zone of Oromia Region and Harari Regional State, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three selected hospitals of COVID-19 treatment centers. Simple random sampling was used to select a sample of 423 participants from each hospital. The self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to assess the presence of common mental disorders. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of common mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers was 22.6%. Being female, married, having had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working in COVID-19 treatment centers and ICU, having any symptoms of COVID-19, current three-month use of any substances, and poor social support were found to be strong predictors of common mental disorders in frontline health workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: The considerable proportions of frontline health care workers have common mental health problems.

ResultsThe median duration of virus positivity was 23 days and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 days. The overall survival at 60 days in this group was 50%. Older age and comorbidities impacted survival negatively. CMV viremia was documented in 11 patients, with a survival of 25% vs 80% in those without viremia with viral load correlating with mortality. ANK cells were markedly depressed in all patients at day 15. However, persistently low ANK cells at 30 days along with an inversely high NKG2C-/NKG2A+ inhibitory NK cells significantly correlated with high CMV viremia as well as mortality, irrespective of KLRC2 genotype. Day 30 ANK cells were significantly lower in KLRC2 deletion group.

This study aimed to understand the risk perception and the behavioral response of the university academics and students towards the COVID-19. Methods A self-administered online survey was conducted among the academic staff and university students in Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The survey questionnaire included eight main questions about the main aspects of personal risk perception and behavioral response to COVID-19 based on a five or nine-point ordinal scale. The eight questions included the number of contacts, the perceived threat level of COVID-19, personal risk perception, ability to avoid infection, frequency of undertaking the protective measures, adherence to the curfew, the negative impact of COVID-19 on life, and sources of obtaining information. Results A total of 976 individuals participated in the study with a mean age  SD of 25.89.7 years. The respondents had the highest perceived threat level towards COVID-19 (mean score = 2.79) in comparison to other medical threats. Around 62% of respondents had no contacts outside their homes. A high percentage of the respondents perceived their risk of getting infection, serious illness, and death as highly unlikely (26.9%, 29.7%, and 41.7%, respectively). The percentage of the respondents who applied these measures frequently or always was high for most of the behaviors, except for wearing masks, wearing gloves, and avoiding touching face. There was a significant ( P <0.001) weak positive correlation between risk perception with protective behaviors;overall risk (beta = 0.080, r=0.189), risk of getting infection (beta=0.066, r=0.179), risk of getting serious illness (beta=0.070, r=0.176) and risk of death (beta=0.058, r=0.154). Conclusion The perceived risk of getting infection with COVID-19 is relatively low. The respondents follow protective behavior measures reasonably. However, the frequency of undertaking some important protective behaviors is relatively low. The risk perception of COVID-19 has a weakly positive impact on following protective behavior. Changing behavior remains a challenge even for the well educated and well aware people.","output":"Risk perception and behavioral response to COVID-19 in Iraqi Kurdistan Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The shared response to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that the vast majority of society believes human well-being - not economic growth - should be at the center of policy.

Changes in care utilization by persons in advanced illness management (AIM) programs during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well known. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in care utilization by homebound AIM patients in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic before and during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Descriptive statistics and tests of differences were used to compare care utilization rates, including emergency department (ED) and inpatient admissions, acute and sub-acute rehabilitation, and AIM program utilization during the pandemic with rates one year prior. RESULTS: Acute and post-acute utilization for enrollees (n=1,468) decreased March-May 2020 compared to one year prior (n=1,452), while utilization of AIM program resources remained high. Comparing 2019 and 2020, ED visits/1000 enrollees were 109 versus 44 (p<0.001), inpatient admissions 213 versus 113 (p<0.001), and rehabilitation facility admissions 56 versus 31 (p=0.014); AIM program home visits were 1935 versus 276 (p<0.001), remote visits (telehealth/telephonic) 0 versus 1079 (p<0.001), and all other phone touches 3032 versus 5062 (p<0.001).

Upon sequence analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, the three strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities to the prototype GIV.2 strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA (91.0C93.0% nt and 97.0C98.0% aa). The sequence of ~3.4-kb portion at the 3 end of the genome of a NoV strain, TE/77-13/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, encoding the VP1 capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to the canine GVI.2 NoV strains C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and FD53/2007/ITA (81.0C84.0% nt and 93.0C94.0% aa identities), suggesting a recombination nature, with the cross-over site being mapped to the ORF1-ORF2 junction.

We assessed clinical research from major clinical journals, comparing methodological and reporting quality of covid-19 papers published in the first wave (here defined as December 2019 to May 2020 inclusive) of the viral pandemic with non-covid papers published at the same time. METHODS: We reviewed research publications (print and online) from The BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine, from first publication of a covid-19 research paper (February 2020) to May 2020 inclusive. Paired reviewers were randomly allocated to extract data on methodological quality (risk of bias) and reporting quality (adherence to reporting guidance) from each paper using validated assessment tools. A random 10% of papers were assessed by a third, independent rater. Overall methodological quality for each paper was rated high, low or unclear. Reporting quality was described as percentage of total items reported. RESULTS: From 168 research papers, 165 were eligible, including 54 (33%) papers with a covid-19 focus. For methodological quality, 18 (33%) covid-19 papers and 83 (73%) non-covid papers were rated as low risk of bias, OR 6.32 (95%CI 2.85 to 14.00). The difference in quality was maintained after adjusting for publication date, results, funding, study design, journal and raters (OR 6.09 (95%CI 2.09 to 17.72)). For reporting quality, adherence to reporting guidelines was poorer for covid-19 papers, mean percentage of total items reported 72% (95%CI:66 to 77) for covid-19 papers and 84% (95%CI:81 to 87) for non-covid. CONCLUSIONS: Across various measures, we have demonstrated that covid-19 research from the first wave of the pandemic was potentially of lower quality than contemporaneous non-covid research. While some differences may be an inevitable consequence of conducting research during a viral pandemic, poor reporting should not be accepted.","output":"Following the science?

Recent studies have highlighted a state of hypercoagulability in patients with SARS-CoV-2, leading to an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The low proportion of PE-associated to DVT in COVID-19 patients may suggest that they have pulmonary thrombosis rather than embolism. There is no guideline recommendation on the treatment of massive PE in COVID-19 patients suffering from ARDS, without cardiogenic shock. CASE SUMMARY: We described a series of seven SARS-COV-2 patients diagnosed with PE, in our institution, who underwent the use of systemic thrombolysis (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) according to the standard protocol of 10 mg over 15 min, then 90 mg over 120 min. DISCUSSION: According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) severity scale, three patients had high-risk PE and four had intermediate high-risk PE. Systemic thrombolysis was found to be associated with a reduction of the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale in five patients, recording a reduction from 3 to 1 in 2/5 patients, and from 3 to 2 in 3/5 patients. Furthermore, 3/5 patients had an initial improvement of their alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio ranging from a 19% (Patient 3) to a 156% improvement (Patient 6). It was also associated with a decrease of the right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and the RV/left ventricular ratio 24 h later. No major bleeding events occurred after the thrombolysis, but the overall mortality after performing systemic thrombolysis was up to 3/7 patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the low level of knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology of the COVID-19 ARDS, venous thromboembolic events, and the microvascular thrombosis, our findings suggest that in the treatment of PE with RV failure in patients with COVID-19 suffering from ARDS, without cardiogenic shock, systemic thrombolysis should be considered.","output":"Acute pulmonary embolism and systemic thrombolysis in the era of COVID-19 global pandemic 2020: a case series of seven patients admitted to a regional hospital in the French epidemic cluster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The original version of this Article contained an error in the Acknowledgements, which incorrectly listed the NIH grant AI142759.

Data from 2,740 calves, originating from 16 French farms and observed from birth until 30 d of age, were analyzed using models that took account of direct genetic, maternal genetic, and common environmental effects. Both direct and maternal genetic parameters were estimated for birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE), neonatal vitality (NV), survival at 30 d (Surv), and umbilical infection and diarrhea at different ages (0 to 5 d: Umb1 and Diar1; 6 to 20 d: Umb2 and Diar2; and 21 to 30 d: Umb3 and Diar3). The heritability values for direct and maternal genetic effects were, 0.026 (SE = 0.027) and 0.096 (SE = 0.042) for Surv, 0.280 (SE = 0.063) and 0.063 (SE = 0.038) for BW, 0.129 (SE = 0.041) and 0 for CE, 0.073 (SE = 0.035) and 0 for NV, 0.071 (SE = 0.038) and 0.017 (SE = 0.026) for Umb1, 0 and 0.082 (SE = 0.029) for Umb2, 0 and 0.044 (SE = 0.030) for Diar1, 0.016 (SE = 0.022) and 0.012 (SE = 0.026) for Diar2, and 0.016 (SE = 0.028) and 0 for Diar3, respectively. Significant genetic variability in beef cattle was thus revealed for five calf health traits: NV, Surv, Diar1, Umb1, and Umb2. In addition, for three traits (Surv, Diar1, and Umb2), maternal genetic effects clearly contributed more to health performance than direct genetic effects. Estimates of genetic correlation between traits varied markedly (from 0 to 1 in absolute values) depending on the traits in question, the age for a given trait, and the type (direct or maternal) of the genetic effects considered. These results suggest that not all health traits in Charolais cattle can be improved simultaneously, and breeders will therefore have to prioritize certain traits of interest in their breeding objectives. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential utility of collecting and integrating data on calf diseases, NV and survival in future beef cattle breeding programs. To ensure appropriate biological and genetic evaluations of calf health performance, it is important to accurately describe the phenotypes for diarrhea and umbilical infections (in terms of age ranges) and account for maternal genetic and common environmental effects that explain calf health performance traits. Further investigation and improved data collection are now necessary to maximize the efficiency of breeding schemes designed to simultaneously improve production and health traits.","output":"Genetic analysis of calf health in Charolais beef cattle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Physical inactivity increases the risk of global death but we did not know the impact of lockdown strategy against COVID-19 on physical activity (PA","output":"Impact of Lockdown on Physical Activity in the Early COVID-19 Presence: Greece National Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence-based policymaking (EBP) contends that policy decisions are successful when informed by evidence.

The pool positivity rate was 0.8%; 98.2% of pools tested negative and 0.2% inconclusive, and 0.8% of pools submitted could not be tested. Of 310 positive pools, 70.6% had an N1 or N2 probe cycle threshold (CT) value of &#8804;30.

However, of 124 positive pools with full reflex testing data available for analysis, 32 (25.8%) of BinaxNOW pool deconvolution testing attempts did not identify a positive individual, requiring additional reflex testing. With sufficient staffing support and low pool positivity rates, pooled sample collection and reflex testing were feasible for schools.

METHODS: Forty allo-HCT recipients were included in a study of immunization with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at days 0 and 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49 while neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type (NT50) were assessed at days 0 and 49. Results observed in allo-HCT patients were compared to those obtained in 40 healthy adults naive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood cells was performed before vaccination to identify potential predictors of Ab responses. RESULTS: Three patients had detectable anti-RBD Ab before vaccination. Among the 37 SARS-CoV-2 naive patients, 20 (54%) and 32 (86%) patients had detectable anti-RBD Ab 21 days and 49 days postvaccination. Comparing anti-RBD Ab levels in allo-HCT recipients and healthy adults, we observed significantly lower anti-RBD Ab levels in allo-HCT recipients at days 21, 28 and 49. Further, 49% of allo-HCT patients versus 88% of healthy adults had detectable NT50 Ab at day 49 while allo-HCT recipients had significantly lower NT50 Ab titers than healthy adults (P = 0.0004). Ongoing moderate/severe chronic GVHD (P < 0.01) as well as rituximab administration in the year prior to vaccination (P < 0.05) correlated with low anti-RBD and NT50 Ab titers at 49 days after the first vaccination in multivariate analyses. Compared to healthy adults, allo-HCT patients without chronic GVHD or rituximab therapy had comparable anti-RBD Ab levels and NT50 Ab titers at day 49. Flow cytometry analyses before vaccination indicated that Ab responses in allo-HCT patients were strongly correlated with the number of memory B cells and of naive CD4(+) T cells (r > 0.5, P < 0.01) and more weakly with the number of follicular helper T cells (r = 0.4, P = 0.01).

The infection transmission rate is considered more rapid than other deadly pandemics and severe epidemics encountered earlier, such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza, Marburg, SARS, and MERS. The public health situation therefore is really at a challenging crossroads. MAIN BODY: The internal and external and resident microbiota community is crucial in human health and is essential for immune responses. This community tends to be altered due to pathogenic infections which would lead to severity of the disease as it progresses. Few of these resident microflora become negatively active during infectious diseases leading to coinfection, especially the opportunistic pathogens. Once such a condition sets in, it is difficult to diagnose, treat, and manage COVID-19 in a patient. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the various reported possible coinfections that arise in COVID-19 patients vis--vis other serious pathological conditions.

Next, it applies text mining and topic modeling techniques to the tweets to determine the prominent themes, terms, and topics in those discussions to understand public feelings, behavior, and broader sentiments about the changes brought about by COVID-19 on transportation systems. Results reveal that people are avoiding public transport and shifting to using private car, bicycle, or walking. Bicycle sales have increased remarkably but car sales have declined. Cycling and walking, telecommuting, and online schools are identified as possible solutions to COVID-19 mobility problems and to reduce car usage with an aim to tackle traffic congestion in the post-pandemic world. People appreciated government decisions for funding allocation to public transport, and asked for the reshaping, restoring, and safe reopening of transit systems. Protecting transit workers, riders, shop customers and staff, and office employees is identified as a crucial reopening challenge, whereas mask wearing, phased reopening, and social distancing are proposed as effective reopening strategies.

Historically, Step 1 scores have been important for otolaryngology resident applicant selection. The purpose of this study was to understand and evaluate otolaryngology residency program directors' (OPDs) opinions on the impact following the change in Step 1 score reporting. METHODS A 22-question survey administered through Qualtrics was sent to 113 academic otolaryngology residency program directors in April 2020. Information about demographics, impressions on the new Step 1 score format, anticipated changes in applicant selection, impact on mental health, and importance of various other factors in selecting applicants were queried. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey results. RESULTS A total of 41 out of 113 (36.3%) OPDs completed this survey. A majority of surveyed OPDs (80.5%) do not support the decision to change Step 1 to a pass/fail system. In the absence of a three digit numeric USMLE Step 1 score, OPDs indicated prioritization of away rotations, letters of recommendation (LORs), personal prior knowledge of the applicant, grades in required clerkship, and class ranking or quartile. 53.7% of OPDs anticipate requiring USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge for interview consideration following this change. CONCLUSION OPDs believe a pass/fail Step 1 score will decrease the importance of this exam and that this change will lead to the implementation and evaluation of additional metrics such as a required Step 2 CK score.","output":"Perceived Impact of USMLE Step 1 Score Reporting to Pass/Fail on Otolaryngology Applicant Selection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Although physiologic, environmental, and social factors influence the development of health conditions, routine decisions, such as food choice, also contribute substantially over time. Behavioral scientists believe that these routine decisions represent a key opportunity to improve population health. We conducted a scoping review of both health and business literature to identify themes in the food choices of young adults aged 19-24 y in the United States. Informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute processes for scoping reviews, we conducted a structured search of 8 health and business databases on 18 April 2017. The databases were PubMed, Business Source Complete, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and ABI/Inform Collection. Eligible literature captured real-world dietary choices of the general population of young adults between 1 January, 2007 and 31 December, 2017. Records were screened in Covidence. Data was extracted into Excel and key findings thematically analyzed. The search returned 9085 records. Ninety-nine records met the eligibility criteria. Themes identified in the foods chosen by young adults include inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, choosing international flavors and food formats, convenience foods, frequent snacking, the selection of healthy foods based on perceptions of what is healthy rather than the nutrient or calorie content of foods, an interest in sustainable production methods, the desire to customize/tailor foods, foods young people find interesting, and regional foods.

However, the use of technology to aid older adults in this endeavor is impeded by the fact that their technological capabilities are lower than those of much of the rest of the population. What is needed to help manage medications is a technology that seamlessly integrates within their comfort levels, such as artificial intelligence agents. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the benefits, barriers, and information needs that can be provided by an artificial intelligenceCpowered medication information voice chatbot for older adults. METHODS: A total of 8 semistructured interviews were conducted with geriatrics experts. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Each interview was coded by 2 investigators (2 among ML, PR, METR, and KR) using a semiopen coding method for qualitative analysis, and reconciliation was performed by a third investigator. All codes were organized into the benefit/nonbenefit, barrier/nonbarrier, and need categories. Iterative recoding and member checking were performed until convergence was reached for all interviews. RESULTS: The greatest benefits of a medication information voice-based chatbot would be helping to overcome the vision and dexterity hurdles experienced by most older adults, as it uses voice-based technology. It also helps to increase older adults medication knowledge and adherence and supports their overall health. The main barriers were technology familiarity and cost, especially in lower socioeconomic older adults, as well as security and privacy concerns. It was noted however that technology familiarity was not an insurmountable barrier for older adults aged 65 to 75 years, who mostly owned smartphones, whereas older adults aged >75 years may have never been major users of technology in the first place. The most important needs were to be usable, to help patients with reminders, and to provide information on medication side effects and use instructions. CONCLUSIONS: Our needs analysis results derived from expert interviews clarify that a voice-based chatbot could be beneficial in improving adherence and overall health if it is built to serve the many medication information needs of older adults, such as reminders and instructions. However, the chatbot must be usable and affordable for its widespread use.","output":"Benefits of, Barriers to, and Needs for an Artificial IntelligenceCPowered Medication Information Voice Chatbot for Older Adults: Interview Study With Geriatrics Experts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or Coronavirus pandemic has generated a very serious and grave global concern regarding the health of every person in the whole world.

We performed a gene expression analysis to identify the molecular and cellular impact of trifarotene treatment on acne papules. Methods: In this open-label prospective study, subjects with moderate inflammatory acne of the back were treated with trifarotene 0.005% or vehicle cream on dedicated areas for 27 days, and 4 biopsies were collected from each subject (1 from skin without a visible acne lesion and three at the site of an acne papule: one baseline, one after vehicle treatment, and one after trifarotene treatment). Large scale gene expression profiling of the biopsies was performed using Affymetrix technology, treatment-specific gene expression profiles were generated using statistical modeling, and pathway analysis was performed. Using single-cell RNAseq data, in silico deconvolution of transcriptomics data was performed to identify cellular signatures. Results: We discovered a unique set of 67 genes modulated by trifarotene that are primarily involved in cellular migration, inflammation, and extracellular matrix reorganization. Changes in cellular expression were similar in both trifarotene-treated and spontaneously-resolving lesions. However, only trifarotene treatment impacted SPP1(+) macrophages, a subset of highly proliferative macrophages recently identified in fibrotic tissue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 21 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria (all men; mean age, 66.0 y) and had pulmonary metastases from esophageal cancer. There were 31 tumors (mean size, 1.7 cm) that were treated with 27 planned ablation sessions. At the initial RF ablation sessions, 3 patients had viable extrapulmonary recurrences, and 18 patients had viable recurrences confined to the lung. Primary study endpoints included patient survival and the determination of prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints included local efficacy and safety of the treatment. The log-rank test was used to identify prognostic factors. Adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. RESULTS Median follow-up duration after the initial RF ablation was 22.4 months (range, 6.2-76.1 mo). Estimated overall survival rates were 85.7% at 1 year, 54.8% at 2 years, and 38.4% at 3 years after the initial RF ablation session. The presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the initial RF ablation session was an unfavorable prognostic factor (P < .001). Local tumor progression was observed in 25.8% (8 of 31) of tumors and occurred 2.6-10.0 months (median, 4.8 mo) after RF ablation. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 7.4% (2 of 27) of sessions, including pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement and pneumoderma requiring surgical intervention. No grade 4 or greater adverse events occurred.

METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study of 417 consecutive COVID-19 patients, we analyze and compare disease severity, outcome, associated complications, and clinical laboratory findings between diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had more ICU admission than non-diabetic COVID-19 patients (20.1% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001). Diabetic COVID-19 patients also recorded higher mortality in comparison to non-diabetic COVID-19 patients (16.7% vs. 12.1%, p < 0.001). Diabetic COVID-19 patients had significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as hypertension. Laboratory investigations also highlighted notably higher levels of C-reactive protein in diabetic COVID019 patients and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. They also showed a higher incidence of complications. logistic regression analysis showed that every 1 mmol/L increase in fasting blood glucose in COVID-19 patients is associated with 1.52 (95% CI: 1.34C1.72, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19.

In rotavirus infected calves, IFN synthesis could be detected in the intestine and in the blood at the time of the diarrheic symptoms. A kinetic study on canulated calves suggested that systemic IFN is of intestinal origin. During TGEV infection (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus) of the newborn piglet, an acute disease which leads to 100% mortality, IFN was found at very high titres (1 000-20 000 u/ml) in the intestine, blood, urine and other organs. Intestinal IFN synthesis started some hours after the onset of diarrhea and was very transient, i.e. no more detectable two days p.i. Unlike the calf situation, IFN response in the serum lasted much longer suggesting an extra-intestinal origin. As a confirmation, piglets infected with cell-adapted strains had high levels of circulating IFN before the onset of intestinal IFN and of diarrhea. Virus and IFN were found in the lungs, due to a so far unrecognized tropism of TGEV for the macrophages.

Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether WFH affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference in developer productivity between WFH and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset of developers daily activities from Baidu Inc., one of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers activities of 138 working days. Out of these records, 1103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that WFH has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming language, project type/age/size. For example, WFH has a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these findings, we get some feedback from developers of Baidu and understand some reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

The sporting world, too, is suffering from the global effects of this disease, with the postponement or cancellation of competitions, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. As a proposal for containing the disease, social isolation was declared. Despite the importance of this measure, it was harmful for Olympic athletes, as they had to stay away from their training site and trainers, as well as their interdisciplinary teams. It is therefore important to study this harm caused, in order to minimize it. In general, it is believed that regular physical activity is associated with improved immune system functioning. The lack of training can therefore have significant consequences for the performance and health of the Olympic athlete. From the athlete's point of view, the impaired immune system, due to the reduced frequency of physical exercise, leaves them more vulnerable to contracting or developing infections or other diseases. The risk of harm due to the decreased performance of preventive works is also evident in this population. The reductions in training load and intensity can cause changes in the athlete's body composition and affect various aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as reducing strength levels and muscle potency. In relation to the athlete's mental health, two aspects are particularly challenging: isolation and uncertainty. Based on the possible harm caused by social isolation, the need is seen for a specific and joint work, in an attempt to minimize it.

METHODS: We analysed data on a sample of 2,613 PASSI and 2,288 PASSI d'Argento interviews, collected between August and December 2020. RESULTS: Among adults, 34% refers a worsening of their financial resources because of the COVID-19 crisis: above all if socially deprived people, with many difficulties (52%) or with a low educational level (41%). Despite keeping up working, 31% of employed people worked less due to the COVID crisis, with a lower wage; 5.5% lost the job and a certain number had to give it up. The worsening of economic resources correlates to changes in working conditions due to the pandemic crisis, but the latter did not fully determine the former. Economic losses are more frequent among people in search of employment (52% vs 35% of occupied or 28% of inactive), those who lost their job (76%) or, despite keeping up working, earn less (66%), but interest also individuals who have not undergone changes per the working condition and volume (19%).

METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult inpatients aged 18 years at Connaught Hospital, an urban tertiary care hospital in Freetown between February and June 2018. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, we enrolled 164 patients. Risk factors for HAIs were previous antibiotic use (93.3%), comorbidities (58.5%) and age (65 years) (23.9%). Of the 164 samples, 89.6% were urine. Bacterial growth was recorded in 58.8% of cultured specimens; the type of specimen was an independent predictor of bacterial growth (p < 0.021). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 29.2% and 19.0% in urine samples and 18.8% and 31.3% in sputum samples, respectively. The overall resistance rates were 58% for all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, 13.4% for carbapenem-resistant non-lactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli, 8.7% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and 1.3% for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).

An online survey was carried out among the population of general practitioners practicing in the WBF between 7 January and 18 March 2020. A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out based on various dimensions of vaccine hesitancy: perception of the risks and the usefulness of vaccines as well as vaccine recommendations for their patients. A total of 251 GPs answered the survey. The average percentage of moderate to high vaccine hesitancy was 50.6%. Three factors were independently associated with increased risk of vaccine hesitancy: an age <50 years old, having no children, and having no contact with selected vaccine-preventable disease (measles, complicated influenza, chronic hepatitis B (HBV), bacterial meningitis, or cervical cancer) in the past 5 years. VH was associated with controversies on vaccines safety. GPs who had vaccinated their children against six diseases (MMR, meningococcus C (MenC), HBV, and HPV) tended not to recommend the same vaccines to their patients. Among GPs with all children vaccinated against HBV, only 37.5% recommended catch-up HBV immunization to their patients. In this small cohort of GP, moderate to high VH was associated with controversies on vaccines safety and with specific personal characteristics (age <50, no children, and no recent experience with a serious VPD).

Recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques have provided an innovative alternative to this challenge via the synthesis of biomedical images within a DL framework known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). This paper aims to introduce how GANs can be deployed for image synthesis in ophthalmology and to discuss the potential applications of GANs-produced images. RECENT FINDINGS Image synthesis is the most relevant function of GANs to the medical field, and it has been widely used for generating 'new' medical images of various modalities. In ophthalmology, GANs have mainly been utilized for augmenting classification and predictive tasks, by synthesizing fundus images and Optical coherence tomography images with and without pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Despite their ability to generate high-resolution images, the development of GANs remains data intensive, and there is a lack of consensus on how best to evaluate the outputs produced by GANs.

This study explored experiences of mathematics education lecturers and students who were first time users of an online learning management system referred to as UEW vclass. The sample comprised 10 students pursuing the degree of Bachelor of Mathematics Education and four lecturers who taught them five different courses at the University of Education Winneba (UEW), Ghana. Data were collected via interviews, and a survey item created on Google forms and administered through WhatsApp pages of respondents. The results of SWOT analysis show that lecturers found the UEW vclass useful and amenable to their teaching and assessment practices. As first-time users, the lecturers found the course creation, online delivery and e-assessment practices exciting, though challenging in terms of their digital and pedagogical skillset. Internet connectivity and system errors affected lecturers real-time lesson delivery sessions while the trustworthiness of e-assessment scores was a serious concern. Students found the UEW vclass suitable, convenient, interesting, and user friendly. However, students challenges were login, network, timing, real-time feedback and typing mathematical symbols.

Machine learning models were initially calibrated by demonstrating that the proposed method can predict anti-COVID-19 candidates among experimental and clinically approved drugs (5658 in total) targeting COVID-19 interactomics with the balanced classification accuracy of 80-85% in 5-fold cross-validated settings. This identified the most promising drug candidates that can be potentially repurposed against COVID-19 including common drugs used to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and metformin.

METHODS: Seven nurse experts identified the linkages of NANDA-I, NOC and NIC for our work related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A model was developed to guide the project. The first step in creating linkages focused on the identification of nursing diagnoses. Then, for each nursing diagnosis, outcomes aligned with all components of the diagnosis were categorized and a list of nursing interventions was selected. The experts used their clinical judgment to make final decisions on the linkages selected in this study. FINDINGS: Two community level nursing diagnoses were identified as key problems appropriate for a pandemic related to COVID-19: Deficient Community Health and Ineffective Community Coping. For the nursing diagnosis Deficient Community Health, eight nursing outcomes and 12 nursing interventions were selected. In comparison for the nursing diagnosis, Ineffective Community Coping, nine nursing outcomes and 18 nursing interventions were identified. A total of40 concepts were identified for future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS: The nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions selected during this linkage process provide knowledge to support the community challenged with responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the opportunity to quantify the impact of nursing care, and enhance nursing practice by promoting the use of three standardized terminologies.

METHODS: A qualitative study; interviews with doctors experiencing persistent symptoms were conducted by telephone or video call. Interviews were transcribed and analysis conducted using an inductive and thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen doctors participated. The following themes are reported: making sense of symptoms, feeling let down, using medical knowledge and connections, wanting to help and be helped, combining patient and professional identity. Experiencing long COVID can be transformative: many expressed hope that good would come of their experiences.

Loss of smell and taste occurring in COVID-19 cases are now recognized by the international scientific community as being among the main symptoms of the disease. This study investigates loss of smell and taste in outpatients and hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Enrolled in the study were patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19. Excluded were patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, common cold, influenza, and olfactory/gustatory dysfunction predating the pandemic. Patients were asked about changes in their sense of smell and taste by structured questionnaire. Their status was classified according to severity of the symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were included in the study, of whom 129 received outpatient treatment, whereas 88 were hospitalized; mean age was 41.74 years (range18C76), 59.4% were male. At evaluation for olfactory dysfunction, 53.9% of the patients were found to be normal, whereas 33.2% were anosmic. No gustatory dysfunction was found in 49.8% of patients, whereas in those with loss of taste, the most commonly recorded symptom was ageusia. Anosmia was significantly more common in outpatients (P = 0.038). Presentation of chemosensorial symptoms in women was higher than in men (P = 0.009). No correlation was found between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction and age (P = 0.178).

We carried out a thorough analysis of the epidemiological and bacteriological complexity of a cluster in Almera, Spain. The cluster, initially associated with Moroccan migrants and with no secondary cases identified in 4 years, then reappeared in Spanish-born individuals. In one case, two Mycobacterium tuberculosis clonal variants were identified. We reanalyzed the cluster, supported by the characterization of multiple cultured isolates and respiratory specimens, whole-genome sequencing, and epidemiological case interviews. Our findings showed that the cluster, which was initially thought to have restarted activity with just a single case harboring a small degree of within-host diversity, was in fact currently growing due to coincidental reactivation of past exposures, with clonal diversity transmitted throughout the cluster. In one case, within-host diversity was amplified, probably due to prolonged diagnostic delay.

Given that the nature of this crisis is a combination of multiple problems, it is substantially different from all other financial crises known to us. It is therefore urgent to re-evaluate the safe-haven role of some traditional asset types, namely, gold, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and commodities.

The sample studied covers a training period between AugustCDecember 2019 and a testing period of December 2019CMarch 2020. Furthermore, we calculate the cross-quantilogram between pair-wise asset returns and compare their directional predictability on left-quantiles in both normal market conditions and the COVID-19 period.

In many areas it has been moved from the more traditional ECT suites to general surgical theatres for a number of reasons, most notably being the need to ensure adequate ventilation. The introduction of the need for PPE to be worn throughout ECT and for general hospital operating procedures to be adhered to has also been a big change. The change in the required infection control procedures has had an impact on treatment capacity and has led many areas to reduce, relocate or centralise their ECT provisions which has had a knock on effect on training. This study assesses the perceived impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of training and learning in ECT for core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West as well as their perceived competence levels. METHOD: Views were sought through surveys and focus groups from September to December 2020, participants were core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West. Participants were recruited via email, the total population size was 87, 21 Core trainees responded and 14 higher trainees. From the survey respondents, 5 participants agreed to attend a focus group. RESULT: Results show that the provision of ECT training has been poor during the COVID-19 outbreak. Almost 81% of core trainees surveyed and 92.86% of higher trainees had participated in no ECT sessions from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak to the time of data collection eight to ten months later. 81% of core trainees and 85.71% of higher trainees had received no teaching in any form about ECT over the period studied. When considering the competencies required in ECT for a core trainee, one (4.76%) felt they were fully competent, 3 (14.29%) nearly competent, 7(33.33%) needs some improvement, 10 (47.62%) not yet competent. Only one higher trainee felt they met the RCPsych competencies, 5 (35.71%) were nearly competent, 6 (42.86%) need some improvement and 2 (14.29%) were not yet competent. CONCLUSION: This study indicates a clear lack of provision of training which is very concerning ,and possibly pre dates the COVID outbreak, particularly in the case of specialty trainees who may well be consultants in a number of months and will not have the time to make up for the lost training. In order for ECT provision to continue it is crucial that we are able to adequately train the future workforce.","output":"Research into psychiatry trainees views around the impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of electroconvulsive therapy training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic tempted some governments to promise to wage war against it and implement world-beating control mechanisms. In view of their limited success, such claims soon came in for massive criticism, which turned their hyperbolic implicatures and figurative framing against them. Our paper focuses on such cases of metaphor reversal within the context of the British public debate. Drawing on examples from a corpus of media texts, we identify several types of the dissociation, including irony (i.e., putting the figurative claims implicatures in doubt implicitly), sarcasm (i.e., explicitly decrying their plausibility) and satire (i.e., exhibiting their presumed absurdity), with reference to theory models of irony (echo, pretense, mental space structuring).In conclusion, we argue that the seesaw of exchanges between exaggerated figurative claims of (imminent) success made by government politicians and their sarcastic-satirical debunking by media and opposition politicians has an ambivalent effect on public discourse. On the one hand, it highlights contrasts in policy and policy assessment and may also have entertainment value, but on the other hand, it conveys experiences of repeated, serial exposure of hyperbolic government rhetoric. This in turn may lead to an erosion of trust in official communication as being unrealistic, which may foster beliefs in conspiracy theories.","output":"World-beating Pandemic Responses: Ironical, Sarcastic, and Satirical Use of War and Competition Metaphors in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health is an important global issue, and doctors in training need a grounding in the principles of psychiatry. Undergraduate clinical placements in psychiatry can develop core knowledge and skills as well as challenging stigma towards mental illness. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic saw disruption to undergraduate clinical placements. In a U.K. medical school, th e authors were tasked with transforming a 6\\\\week clinical placement in psychiatry into a primarily online course. APPROACH: A 4\\\\week online course was developed in preparation for a condensed clinical placement. A range of resources were drawn upon to address key learning objectives and to engage students in broader thinking about mental health. These included videos and blogs describing personal experiences of mental illness, as well as interviews with prominent psychiatrists. Peer\\\\ and tutor\\\\led sessions complemented these self\\\\directed elements and reduced social isolation. EVALUATION: Sixty\\\\seven students undertook the course, supported by eight consultant tutors. The content and structure of the course were highly rated; however, students indicated that peer group activities could benefit from further development. Students felt prepared for clinical placements and performed equally well in summative written examinations. Feedback indicated the development of positive attitudes towards mental health and illness. IMPLICATIONS: This course demonstrates how, even when clinical contact is challenged, a strong focus can be maintained on social elements of learning and patients' experiences of mental illness. This approach provides opportunities to develop essential knowledge and skills alongside broader attitudinal learning that may have a de\\\\stigmatising effect.","output":"Keeping it human: Pandemic era psychiatry teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental health issues among college students is a leading public health concern, which seems to have been exacerbating during the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous estimates related to psychological burden among college students are available, quantitative synthesis of available data still needs to be performed. Therefore, this meta-analysis endeavors to present collective evidence discussing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among college students. Bibliographical library databases, including Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for relevant studies. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were screened, and two reviewers extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled estimates of psychological indicators among college students. Location, gender, level of severity, and quality scores were used as moderator variables for subgroup analyses. Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test was used to assess publication bias. Twenty-seven studies constituting 90,879 college students met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated 39.4% anxiety (95% CI: 28.6, 51.3; I2 = 99.8%; p-value < 0.0001) and 31.2% depression (95% CI: 19.7, 45.6; I2= 99.8%, p < 0.0001) among college students. The pooled prevalence of stress (26.0%), post-traumatic stress disorder (29.8%), and impaired sleep quality (50.5%) were also reported.

This lockdown has strictly controlled human activities in the entire India. Although this long lockdown has had a serious impact on the social and economic fronts, it has many positive impacts on environment. During this lockdown phase, a drastic fall in emissions of major pollutants has been observed throughout all the parts of India. Therefore, in this research study we have tried to establish a relationship among the fall in emission of pollutants and their impact on reducing regional temperature. This analysis was tested through the application of MannCKendall and Sens slope statistical index with air quality index and temperature data for several stations across the country, during the lockdown period. After the analysis, it has been observed that daily emissions of pollutants (PM(10), PM(2.5), CO, NO(2), SO(2) and NH(3)) decreased by ? 1C ? 2%, allowing to reduce the average daily temperature by 0.3 C compared with the year of 2019. Moreover, this lockdown period reduces overall emissions of pollutants by ? 51C ? 72% on an average and hence decreases the average monthly temperature by 2 C. The same findings have been found in the four megacities in India, i.e., Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai; the rate of temperature fall in the aforementioned megacities is close to 3 C, 2.5 C, 2 C and 2 C, respectively. It is a clear indicator that a major change occurs in air quality, and as a result it reduced lower atmospheric temperature due to the effect of lockdown. It is also a clear indicator that a major change in air quality and favorable temperature can be expected if the strict implementations of several pollution management measures have been implemented by the concern authority in the coming years.","output":"Improvement in ambient-air-quality reduced temperature during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: describir las aplicaciones de la teleodontologa para la atencin de pacientes durante y posterior a la pandemia de la COVID-19.

From August 2021 onwards, India experienced a progressive decline in the number of active SARS-CoV-2 infections, indicative of a downward trend in the explosive second wave. This prospective study was conducted quarterly for one year (May 2020 to June 2021) at a tertiary care hospital in the city of Pune in western India. Receptor-binding domain (RBD, n = 319) and full genome (n = 20) sequences from viral-RNA-positive nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients representing the first and second waves were used for analysis. No Brazilian, South African, or California variants were detected in this study. Until December 2020, only the wild-type strain was prevalent. Concurrent with the upsurge of the second wave in March 2021, 73% (33/45) of RBD sequences harboured L452R/E484Q mutations characteristic of the Kappa variant. In April 2021, co-circulation of Kappa (37%) and Delta (L452R/T478K, 59%) variants was recorded. During May and June 2021, the Delta variant became the predominant circulating variant, and this coincided with a significant decline in the number of COVID-19 cases. Of the 20 full genome sequences, six isolates each exhibited signature mutations of the Kappa and Delta variant. With several states witnessing a reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, continuous monitoring of newer mutations and assessment of their effect on virus transmissibility and their impact on vaccinated or previously exposed individuals is necessary.

Businesses and governments are implementing technologies and policies in order to improve air quality. Despite this the PM(10) air quality in the mining town of Moranbah, Australia, has worsened since measurements commenced in 2011. The annual average PM(10) concentrations during 2012, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all exceeded the Australian National Environmental Protection Measure's standard, and there has been an increase in the frequency of exceedances of the daily standard. The average annual increase in PM(10) was 1.2 [Formula: see text] 0.5 g [Formula: see text] between 2011 and 2019 and has been 2.5 [Formula: see text] 1.2 g [Formula: see text] since 2014. The cause of this has not previously been established. Here, two machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted regression and random forest) have been implemented to model and then meteorologically normalise PM(10) mass concentrations measured in Moranbah. The best performing model, using the random forest algorithm, was able to explain 59% of the variance in PM(10) using a range of meteorological, environmental and temporal variables as predictors. An increasing trend after normalising for these factors was found of 0.6 [Formula: see text] 0.5 g [Formula: see text] since 2011 and 1.7 [Formula: see text] 0.3 g [Formula: see text] since 2014. These results indicate that more than half of the increase in PM(10) is due to a rise in local emissions in the region. The remainder of the rise in PM(10) was found to be due to a decrease of soil water content in the surrounding region, which can facilitate higher dust emissions. Whether the presence of open-cut coal mines exacerbated the role of soil water content is unclear. Although fires can have drastic effects on the local air quality, changes in fire patterns are not responsible for the rising trend. PM(10) composition measurements or more detailed data relating to local sources is still needed to better isolate these emissions. Nonetheless, this study highlights the need and potential for action by industry and government to improve the air quality and reduce health risks for the nearby population.","output":"Meteorological normalisation of PM(10) using machine learning reveals distinct increases of nearby source emissions in the Australian mining town of moranbah"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a novel model to detect the COVID\\\\19 infected person from a Markovian feedback persons in a limited department capacity.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a parallel two-group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation to either culturally sensitive, low-threshold psychoeducation (Tea Garden (TG)) or a waitlist (WL) control group. It takes place at four study sites in Germany. A total of 166 adult asylum seekers who report at least mild mental distress will be randomly assigned. The TG consists of two 90 min group sessions and provides information about mental distress, resources and mental health services in a culturally sensitive manner. The primary outcome is the percentage of participants in the TG, as compared with the WL, achieving an increase in knowledge concerning symptoms of mental disorders, individual resources and mental healthcare from preintervention to postintervention. The further trajectory will be assessed 2 and 6 months after the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in mental distress, openness towards psychotherapy and resilience. Furthermore, healthcare utilisation and economics will be assessed at all assessment points.

Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionally affected by COVID-19 yet report high levels of vaccination hesitancy. Objective We conducted virtual Town Halls to address vaccine hesitancy among racial and ethnic minorities in South Florida. Methods Our approach used social influence and persuasion models. A formative phase gathered meeting preferences from our communities and developed and tested our approach. An implementation phase conducted six virtual Town Halls in partnership with minority community-based organizations. Results The Town Halls reached 383 participants (mean age 37.5 years; 63.4% female, 33.9% male, 2.7% nonbinary; 59% racial/ethnic minority), who completed pre- and post-meeting assessments. Among non-vaccinated participants, at the pre poll, 58% reported a high likelihood of seeking vaccination, rising to 63% at post-assessment. Unvaccinated non-hesitant and hesitant groups were compared on trusted information sources, and reasons and barriers for vaccination. Non-hesitant participants reported significantly greater trust in the COVID-19 Task Force (97.3% vs. 83.3%) as a source of vaccine information than did hesitant participants. Non-hesitant participants were significantly more likely to endorse family safety (82.5% vs. 63.2%), community safety (72.5% vs. 26.3%), personal safety (85% vs. 36.8%), and wanting to return to a normal life (70% vs. 31.6%), as reasons for vaccination than were hesitant participants. Hesitant participants were significantly more likely to endorse concerns about vaccine safety doubts (63.2% vs. 17.5%) and not believing the pandemic is as bad as people say it is (21.1% vs. 5%) as barriers to vaccination than were non-hesitant participants. Qualitative data revealed high consumer satisfaction with the Town Halls.

To overcome these limitations, new FMD vaccines must ensure improved safety with non-oil-based adjuvants, a broad spectrum of host defenses within/between serotypes, and the simultaneous induction of cellular and humoral immunity. We designed a novel, immune-potent, recombinant protein rpHSP70-AD that induces robust cellular immunity and elicits a broad spectrum of host defenses against FMD virus (FMDV) infections. We demonstrated that an oil emulsion-free vaccine containing rpHSP70-AD mediates early, mid-term, and long-term immunity and drives potent host protection against FMDV type O and A, suggesting its potential as an FMD vaccine adjuvant in mice and pigs. These results suggest a key strategy for establishing next-generation FMD vaccines, including novel adjuvants.","output":"The HSP70-fused foot-and-mouth disease epitope elicits cellular and humoral immunity and drives broad-spectrum protective efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite improved antiretroviral treatments, people living with HIV (PLWH) continue to suffer from HIV-related fatigue and sleep disturbances.

The starting point of this assessment is a procedure to evaluate in naturally ventilated environments, the current infectious risk by using measurements of indoor/outdoor CO2 concentrations to calculate actual air changes per hour. The method was applied to some typical school environments in Italy. The results indicated very infectious situations with reproduction number Ro values up to exceed 13. But, the simulations assessed an extraordinary reduction of indoor viral concentration and consequently of the infection risk by a strong mechanical ventilation. High ventilation rates make facemasks effective even with use levels (from 50%) reasonable also for pupils. This way, R0 goes down the value one. As regards energy performance, the behavior of an autonomous high efficiency air handling unit (HEAHU), to be installed in an existing naturally ventilated classroom, was simulated in the monitored days.

Lack of time, facility access, and travel distances are barriers to participation in PA interventions. eHealth technologies may address some of these barriers, serving as a viable way to promote PA behavior change in this population. However, no review from July 2018 has synthesized available evidence across eHealth and cancer types or examined the use of behavioral theory and behavior change techniques (BCTs), leaving important gaps in knowledge. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive, updated overview of evidence on eHealth PA interventions for adults with cancer by describing the current state of the literature, exploring associations between intervention characteristics and effectiveness, and identifying future research needs. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched for eHealth PA interventions for adults affected by cancer. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate, with consultation from the senior author (NCR). BCT coding, risk of bias, and completeness of reporting were performed using standardized tools. Results were summarized via narrative synthesis and harvest plots. Weight analyses were conducted to explore the associations between intervention characteristics and effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 71 articles (67 studies) involving 6655 participants (mean age 56.7 years, SD 8.2) were included. Nearly 50% (32/67) of the articles were published after July 2018. Significant postintervention PA increases were noted in 52% (35/67) of the studies, and PA maintenance was noted in 41% (5/12) of the studies that included a follow-up. Study duration, primary objectives, and eHealth modality (eg, websites, activity trackers, and SMS text messaging) varied widely. Social cognitive theory (23/67, 34%) was the most used theory. The mean number of BCTs used across the studies was 13.5 (SD 5.5), with self-monitoring, credible sources, and goal setting being used in >90% of studies. Weight analyses showed the greatest associations between increased PA levels and PA as a primary outcome (0.621), interventions using websites (0.656) or mobile apps (0.563), interventions integrating multiple behavioral theories (0.750), and interventions using BCTs of problem solving (0.657) and action planning (0.645). All studies had concerns with high risk of bias, mostly because of the risk of confounding, measurement bias, and incomplete reporting. CONCLUSIONS: A range of eHealth PA interventions may increase PA levels among adults affected by cancer, and specific components (eg, websites, use of theory, and action planning) may be linked to greater effectiveness. However, more work is needed to ascertain and optimize effectiveness, measure long-term effects, and address concerns with bias and incomplete reporting.

Early reports were suggestive of a possibility, while by early 2020 it was clearly evident that although SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system, the brain is one of the most affected organs post-recovery. Although it may be premature to comment on the long-term effects of COVID-19 in brain, some reliable predictions can be made based on the data currently available. Further, exploring the CNS connections of SARS-CoV-2 is of keen interest for neuroscience researchers. As soon as the virus enters the nasal region, it is exposed to the olfactory nervous system which is interlinked with the visual system, and hence we explore the mechanism of entry of this virus into CNS, including brain, olfactory and retinal nervous systems. In this review, we have thoroughly reviewed reports about both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with respect to their ability to breach the blood-brain and blood-retinal barriers. We have compiled different neurological conditions resulting from COVID-19 and looked into viral infections related to COVID-19 to understand how the virus may gain control of the olfactory and visual systems. Once the dust settles on the pandemic, it would be interesting to explore the extent of viral infection in the CNS. The longterm effects of this virus in the CNS are not yet known, and several scientific research papers evolving in this field will throw light on the same.","output":"Central nervous system as a target of novel coronavirus infections: Potential routes of entry and pathogenic mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural infection by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can affect interpretation of immunological studies in mice. MHV, a collective term describing a group of corona viruses, is found in natural infections in over 70% of laboratory mouse populations in the U.S.A. and Canada. Natural outbreaks of MHV in our animal colony afforded us the opportunity to study MHV-induced immunosuppression as well as the effects of MHV infection on neurotransmitter immunomodulation. Concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated DNA synthesis by spleen T lymphocytes from MHV-infected mice was 20-50% that of non-infected mice. The MHV infection also altered neurotransmitter modulation of spleen T-lymphocyte activation. In contrast to noradrenaline ablation of Con A-activated DNA synthesis by spleen lymphocytes from non-infected mice, DNA synthesis by the infected group was not inhibited by noradrenaline or dibutyryl-cAMP. These effects of MHV infection were specific for spleen T lymphocytes since MHV infection did not alter Con A stimulation of thymocytes, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of spleen B lymphocytes, or noradrenaline inhibition of thymocyte and B-cell DNA synthesis. MHV infection also did not alter spleen T-lymphocyte subset proportions. Thus, MHV infection inhibits spleen T-lymphocyte activation and blocks in vitro catecholamine and cAMP regulation of spleen T-cell activation but does not affect activation of thymic cells or spleen B cells.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus infection suppresses modulation of mouse spleen T-cell activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lockdown periods have changed the way that people and communities live, work and interact.

In essence, the immersive nature of VR and augmented reality technology has been warmly welcomed in all aspects of medicine, gradually becoming increasingly feasible to incorporate into everyday practice. In recent years, XR has become increasingly adopted in thoracic surgery, although the extent of its applications is unclear. Here, we aim to review the current applications of XR in thoracic surgery. METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of VR and/or augmented reality in thoracic surgery in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database and Google Scholar, from inception to December 2020. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1494 citations, of which 21 studies published from 2007 to 2019 were included in this review. Three main areas were identified: (i) the application of XR in thoracic surgery training; (ii) preoperative planning of thoracic procedures; and (iii) intraoperative assistance. Overall, XR could produce progression along the learning curve, enabling trainees to reach acceptable standards before performing in the operating theatre. Preoperatively, through the generation of 3D-renderings of the thoracic cavity and lung anatomy, VR increases procedural accuracy and surgical confidence through familiarization of the patients anatomy. XR-assisted surgery may have therapeutic use particularly for complex cases, where conventional methods would yield inadequate outcomes due to inferior accuracy.

DESIGN: We identified key individual, household and community characteristics influencing COVID-19 risks of infection and survival, guided by international experiences and consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance. Using publicly available data, we developed an open-access online tool that allows county-specific querying and mapping of risk factors. As an illustrative example, we assess the pairwise intersections of age (individual level), poverty (household level) and prevalence of group homes (community-level) in US counties. We also examine how these factors intersect with the proportion of the population that is people of colour (ie, not non-Hispanic white), a metric that reflects histories of US race relations. We defined high risk counties as those above the 75th percentile. This threshold can be changed using the online tool. SETTING: US counties. PARTICIPANTS: Analyses are based on publicly available county-level data from the Area Health Resources Files, American Community Survey, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlas file, National Center for Health Statistic and RWJF Community Health Rankings. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significant intercounty variation in the distribution of individual, household and community characteristics that affect risks of infection, severe disease or mortality from COVID-19. About 9% of counties, affecting 10 million residents, are in higher risk categories for both age and group quarters. About 14% of counties, affecting 31 million residents, have both high levels of poverty and a high proportion of people of colour.

Healthcare 4.0 mainly consisted of periodic medical data sensing, aggregation, data transmission, data sharing, and data storage. The sensitive and personal data of patients lead to several challenges while protecting it from hackers. Therefore storing, accessing, and sharing the patient medical information on the cloud needs security attention that data should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in cloud service provider, several cryptography algorithms are designed so far. However, such conventional solutions failed to achieve the trade-off between the requirements of EHR security solutions such as computational efficiency, service side verification, user side verifications, without the trusted third party, and strong security.

This study is a part of a larger online study on problematic smartphone use in Japan, originally planned in 2019, and expanded in August 2020 to include the impact of COVID-19. 51,246 adults completed an online survey during the pandemic (August 2020), in Japan. Of these, 3,938 had also completed the survey before the onset of the pandemic (December, 2019) and were used as the study population to determine how the pandemic has influenced IGD and PIU. IGD was assessed using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS). PIU was measured using the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS). The prevalence of probable IGD during COVID-19 was 4.1% [95%CI, 3.9% to 4.2%] overall (N=51,246), and 8.6% among younger people (age < 30), higher than reported before the pandemic (1 - 2.5%).

Hence, the implications of SW on work meaningfulness are investigated through the mediating role of interpersonal exchanges at work. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigate both the direct and indirect effects of SW on employees' perceived meaningfulness at work. Secondary data come from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey. The study encompasses a sample of 30,932 employees. A mediation model based on ordinary least square regressions and bootstrap sampling is designed to obtain evidence of SW's implications on meaningfulness at work through the mediating role of interpersonal relationships (IR). Findings The research findings suggest that SW triggers a positive sense of the significance of work. However, it negatively affects IR with peers and supervisors, entailing professional and spatial isolation. Impaired IR twists the positive implications of SW on organizational meaningfulness (OM), curtailing the employees' sense of significance at work. Practical implications SW is a double-edged sword. It contributes to the enrichment of OM, enhancing the individual self-determination to shape the spatial context of work. However, its side effects on interpersonal exchanges generate a drift toward organizational meaninglessness.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Based on the narrative literature review, hypotheses and research questions were formulated and the meaning of key categories was clarified. Data for the analysis were derived from quantitative research conducted using the CAWI technique. The survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,000 working Poles. The analysis of the results was performed using the methods of descriptive statistics and statistical tests to check the correlations between variables. Findings: The research results did not confirm the beneficial effect of nonstandard forms of employment on the labor activation of women. Women do not work in these forms more often than men, but they are more frequently employed involuntarily. The possibility to choose the form of employment is linked to a better meeting of the interests of working women. In the standard forms, women's interests that are satisfied include employment stability, protection and access to social benefits, health services at the employer's expense, good occupational safety and health, training at the employer's expense and assistance during redundancy. In nonstandard forms, these mainly include a good atmosphere and the possibility to influence working time organization. Practical Implications: The results of the research can be used in making the decisions of political character, concerning the applicability and share of particular forms of employment in the labor market. From the perspective of usefulness to employers, important results were obtained concerning the possibilities of choosing the form of employment and meeting specific interests of women.

Because there are no disease-modifying therapies for osteoarthritis, relief of symptoms and maintenance of quality of life through improving joint function become the focus of management. Although highly effective for pain relief, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with systemic adverse reactions that are sometimes treatment limiting, especially for older patients. Thus, osteoarthritis management in elderly populations is shifting away from traditional NSAIDs to therapies that provide comparable pain relief with improved safety. Since the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the use of topical NSAIDs to manage osteoarthritis pain, current treatment guidelines put forth by several professional societies have begun to recommend topical NSAIDs as an alternative therapy and, most recently, as first-line therapy for osteoarthritis management in the elderly.

In general, SARS-CoV-2 causes symptoms ranging from the common cold to severe conditions accompanied by lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome in addition to other organs destruction. The main impact upon SARS-CoV-2 infection is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. Thus, lung cancer patients are identified as a particularly high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications. On the other hand, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), that promotes cellular entry of this virus in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Today, there are no vaccines and/or effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Thus, manipulation of key entry genes of this virus especially in lung cancer patients could be one of the best approaches to manage SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group of patients.

Using different input modalities for emotion, i.e. facial expression and speech sentiment, the empathic Ryan detects users' emotional state and utilizes an affective dialogue manager to generate a response. On the other hand, the non-empathic Ryan lacks facial expression and uses scripted dialogues that do not factor in the users' emotional state. We studied these two versions of Ryan with 10 older adults living in a senior care facility. The statistically significant improvement in the users' reported face-scale mood measurement indicates an overall positive effect from the interaction with both the empathic and non-empathic versions of Ryan.

To investigate if WU virus is related to acute respiratory infections in infants and children in Beijing, specimens collected from 674 pediatric patients with ARI from April 2007 to May 2008 and from 202 children without ARI were used for this investigation. Common respiratory viruses were tested by virus isolation and/or antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescent assay followed by RT-PCR or PCR for other viruses associated with respiratory infections in specimens collected from patients with ARI before WU virus DNA was detected. WU virus DNA was detected by initial screening and secondary confirmation PCR for all specimens. The region encoding the VP2 gene of the virus was amplified from 17 WU-virus-positive clinical specimens, and sequence analysis was performed. Thirty-eight of 674 (5.6%) specimens from patients with ARI and 3 of 202 (1.5%) specimens from children without ARI yielded PCR products with the predicted molecular weight, using either screening or confirmation primer sets, indicating that these specimens were WU virus positive. However, more than 60% of the 38 WU-virus-positive specimens from patients with ARI were also positive for one or more respiratory viruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the region encoding the VP2 gene from 17 Beijing WU viruses shared high homology (>98.5%) with sequences from GenBank and among themselves.

Global collaboration offers the best chance of obtaining these data, at scale and in time. In the absence of effective therapies, insights derived from real-time observational data will be a crucial means of improving outcomes. Objective: In response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a research and data-sharing collaborative has been assembled to harness the cumulative experience of intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights. Design: The COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium observational study is an international, multicenter, prospective, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. Setting: This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on January 1st, 2020 and currently includes more than 350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrolls patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge, or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Participants: All subjects, without age limit, requiring admission to an ICU for SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or next-generation sequencing or with high clinical suspicion of the infection. Patients admitted to an ICU for any other reason are excluded. Main outcomes and measures: Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the ISARIC/SPRINT-SARI networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies. Final outcomes of in-hospital death, discharge or continuing admissions at 28 days. Discussion: This large-scale, observational study of COVID-19 in the critically ill will provide rapid international characterization. Open-ended accrual will increase the power to answer hypothesis-led questions over time.

Generally, the spike proteins tolerate N-glycolyl modification, but selectivities differ among viruses targeting different hosts. On the other hand, the lectin domain of the corresponding HEs showed a substantial decrease or loss of binding of N-glycolylated sialosides. MD simulations indicate that glycolyl recognition by HE is mediated by polar residues in a loop region (109-119) that interacts with the 5-N-glycolyl moiety.

RESULTS: Of a total of 2,411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (SD  5.3; range 12?45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory (STAI) score, 79.9% (95%CI 78.2?81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak and 51.3% (95%CI 49.2?53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of COVID-19 was over (during the study period).

Consequently, a large number of EM images of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 viruses with cells have been made available by numerous labs. However, due to EM recording techniques at high resolution, images of infection scenes are very noisy and they appear two dimensional (flat). Current research consequently aims (A) at methods that can remove noise, and (B) at techniques that allow for recovering a 3D impression of the virus or its parts. Here we discuss a novel method which can recover a spatial impression of a whole infection scene at high resolution. In contrast to previous approaches which aim at the reconstruction of single spike proteins or a single virus, the here used method can be applied to a single noisy EM image of an infection scene. As one example image, we show a high resolution image of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero cell cultures (Fig. 1). The method we use is based on probabilistic machine learning algorithms which can operate in a zero-shot setting, i.e., in a setting when just one noisy image (and no large and clean image corpus) is available. The probabilistic method we apply can estimate non-noisy images by inferring first order statistics (pixel means) across image patches using a previously learned probabilistic image representation. Estimating higher order statistics and appropriately chosen probabilistic models then allow for the generation of images that enhance details and give a spatial impression of a full nanoscopic scene.","output":"Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Scenes by Zero-Shot Enhancements of Electron Microscopy Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of disulphide bond in mediating viral peptide entry into host cells is well known. In the present work, we elucidate the role of disulphide (SS) bond in partitioning mechanism of membrane-active Hepatitis A Virus-2B (HAV-2B) peptide, which harbours three cysteine residues promoting formation of multiple SS-bonded states. The inclusion of SS-bond not only results in a compact conformation but also induces distorted -helical hairpin geometry in comparison to SS-free state. Owing to these, the hydrophobic residues get buried, restricting the insertion of SS-bonded HAV-2B peptide into lipid packing defects and thus the partitioning of the peptide is completely or partly abolished. In this way, the disulphide bond can potentially regulate the partitioning of HAV-2B peptide such that the membrane remodelling effects of this viral peptide are significantly reduced. The current findings may have potential implications in drug designing, targeting the HAV-2B protein by promoting disulphide bond formation within its membrane-active region.

FSC/SSC(high)CD4(high)NKp46(+) cells produced high levels of IFN- after CpG ODN 2216 stimulation, a hallmark of pDC function. Following receptor triggering with plate-bound monoclonal antibodies against NKp46, phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of NKp46 was analyzed in pDCs and NK cells. Comparable to NK cells, NKp46 triggering led to an upregulation of the phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) in pDCs, indicating an active signaling pathway of NKp46 in porcine pDCs. Nevertheless, a defined effector function of the NK-associated receptor on porcine pDCs could not be demonstrated yet. NKp46-mediated cytotoxicity, as shown for NK cells, does not seem to occur, as NKp46(+) pDCs did not express perforin.

Accumulating evidence suggests that cytokines storms are closely associated to COVID-19 severity and death. Here, we aimed to explore the key factors related to COVID-19 severity and death, especially in terms of the male patients and those in western countries. Methods: To clarify whether inflammatory cytokines have role in COVID-19 severity and death, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science to identify related studies with the keywords COVID-19 and cytokines. The data were measured as the mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) by Review Manager 5.3 software. The risk of bias was assessed for each study using appropriate checklists. Results: We preliminarily screened 13,468 studies from the databases. A total of 77 articles with 13,468 patients were ultimately included in our study. The serum levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-1, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-17 were higher in the severity or death group. Notably, we also found that the circulating levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-2R and TNF- were significantly different between males and females. The serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-2R and TNF- were much higher in males than in females, which implies that the increased mortality and severity in males was partly due to the higher level of these cytokines. Moreover, we found that in the severe and non-survivor groups, European patients had elevated levels of IL-6 compared with Asian patients. Conclusion: These large-scale data demonstrated that the circulating levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-2R, IL-1, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-17 are potential risk factors for severity and high mortality in COVID-19.

Exceptionally small plating systems for these birds are required, which are relatively expensive and difficult to insert. To study avian fracture healing after repair using miniplates, we evaluated 2 steel miniplate systems in 27 pigeons ( Columba livia ) divided into 4 groups. In each pigeon, the left ulna and radius were transected and the ulna was repaired with a bone plate. In groups A and B, a 1.3-mm adaption plate was applied without and with a figure-of-eight bandage; in groups C and D, a 1.0-mm compression plate was applied without and with a bandage, respectively. Healing was evaluated with radiographs after 3, 14, and 28 days; flight tests were conducted after 14, 21, and 28 days; and the wing was macroscopically examined after euthanasia of birds on day 28. Fractures healed without bending or distortion of the plate in all 27 birds, and no significant differences in healing were found between treatment groups. At the end of the study, 23 pigeons (85.2%) showed good or very good flight ability. Results show the 1.3-mm adaption plate and the 1.0-mm compression plate meet the requirements for avian osteosynthesis and can be recommended for fracture repair of the ulna or other long bones in birds weighing less than 500 g.

This study aims to shed light on the virus dynamics among wild carnivores thanks to the analysis of 213 samples collected between 1994 and 2013 in wild ecosystems from Spain. We determined the presence of carnivore parvovirus DNA by real-time PCR and sequenced the vp2 gen from 22 positive samples to characterize the strains and to perform phylogenetic analysis. The presence of carnivore parvovirus DNA was confirmed in 18% of the samples, with a higher prevalence detected in wolves (Canis lupus signatus, 70%). Fourteen sequences belonging to nine wolves, three Eurasian badgers (Meles meles), a common genet (Genetta genetta) and a European wildcat (Felis silvestris) were classified as canine parvovirus 2c (CPV-2c); five sequences from three wolves, a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and a stone marten (Martes foina) as CPV-2b; and three sequences from a badger, a genet and a stone marten as feline parvovirus (FPV). This was the first report of a wildcat infected with a canine strain. Sequences described in this study were identical or very close related to others previously found in domestic carnivores from distant countries, suggesting that cross-species transmission takes place and that the parvovirus epidemiology in Spain, as elsewhere, could be influenced by global factors.","output":"Genetic characterization of Carnivore Parvoviruses in Spanish wildlife reveals domestic dog and cat-related sequences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute ischemic stroke may occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but risk factors, in-hospital events, and outcomes are not well studied in large cohorts. We identified risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We analyzed the data from 54 health care facilities using the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 dataset. The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.3%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8163 patients with COVID-19. Among all patients with COVID-19, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6C2.4]; P<0.0001) after adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 199 (1.0%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 19 513 patients without COVID-19.

However, it is sometimes unclear whether and how Indigenous communities are engaged in research that impacts them, and whether and how engagement is reported. Indigenous health research varies in its degree of community engagement from minimal involvement to being community-directed and led. Research led and directed by Indigenous communities can support reconciliation and reclamation in Canada and globally, however clearer reporting and understandings of community-led research is needed. This scoping review assesses (a) how and to what extent researchers are reporting community engagement in Indigenous health research in Atlantic Canada, and (b) what recommendations exist in the literature regarding participatory and community-led research. METHODS Eleven databases were searched using keywords for Indigeneity, geographic regions, health, and Indigenous communities in Atlantic Canada between 2001-June 2020. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they were: peer-reviewed; written in English; health-related; and focused on Atlantic Canada. Data were extracted using a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. 211 articles were retained for inclusion. RESULTS Few empirical articles reported community engagement in all aspects of the research process. Most described incorporating community engagement at the project's onset and/or during data collection; only a few articles explicitly identified as entirely community-directed or led. Results revealed a gap in reported capacity-building for both Indigenous communities and researchers, necessary for holistic community engagement. Also revealed was the need for funding bodies, ethics boards, and peer review processes to better facilitate participatory and community-led Indigenous health research. CONCLUSION As Indigenous communities continue reclaiming sovereignty over identities and territories, participatory research must involve substantive, agreed-upon involvement of Indigenous communities, with community-directed and led research as the ultimate goal.","output":"Are we walking the talk of participatory Indigenous health research?

Design Cross-sectional validation study. Setting Two study centres in urban and rural German outpatient hospital settings. Participants In total N=83 community-dwelling older adults were recruited (n=40 from urban and n=43 from rural areas; mean age was 78.5 (SD=5.4); 49% male). Primary and secondary outcome measures The final version of the translated LSA-D was related with questions about activities and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/iADL; primary hypothesis), Timed-Up&Go-Test (TUG), self-rated health, balance confidence and history of falls, use of transportation, and sociodemographic factors to obtain construct validity. Secondary outcome measures of health included handgrip strength, screening of cognitive function and comorbidities. To assess conduct construct validity, correlations between LSA-D and all health measures were examined for total sample, urban and rural subsamples using bivariate regression and multiple adjusted regression models. Posthoc analyses included different LSA-D scoring methods for each region. All parameters were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping procedure.

Pediatric population has been less studied than adult population and prompt diagnosis is challenging due to asymptomatic or mild episodes. Radiology is an important complement to clinical and epidemiological features. OBJECTIVE: To establish the most common CXR patterns in children with COVID-19, evaluate interobserver correlation and to discuss the role of imaging techniques in the management of children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients between 0 and 16 years of age with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection and CXR were selected. Two paediatric radiologists independently evaluated the images and assessed the type of abnormality, distribution and evolution when available. RESULTS: Median age was 79.8 months (ranging from 2 weeks to 16 years of age). Fever was the most common symptom (43.5%). 90% of CXR showed abnormalities. Peribronchial cuffing was the most common finding (86.3%) followed by GGOs (50%). In both cases central distribution was more common than peripheral. Consolidations accounted for 18.1%. Normal CXR, pleural effusion, and altered cardiomediastinal contour were the least common. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of CXR showed abnormalities in children with COVID-19. However, findings are nonspecific. Interobserver correlation was good in describing consolidations, normal x-rays and GGOs.

With the advent of laparoscopic surgery and its continuous development, the focus has shifted to 'scarless' surgery. In recent times, the innovative technique of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been applied in gallbladder removal and even more complex biliopancreatic procedures to further minimize the invasiveness of the surgery. Newer developments in laparoscopic equipments and instrumentation have helped to further evolve this field of minimally invasive surgery. Literature search was performed using the following online search engines: Google, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and the online Springer link library. The terms used for the search were as follows: SILS, LESS, single-incision laparoscopic surgery, single-port laparoscopic surgery, SILS cholecystectomy, and SILS pancreatic surgery. Articles that matched the search criteria were selected and extensively reviewed. Moreover, pertinent information on instrumentation and technology for SILS and LESS was obtained by accessing websites of manufacturers. Although SILS represents the search for an essentially scarless surgery, there is still not a widespread use and uniformity of this procedure. SILS is performed either by single- or multiple-port technique. In the present article, we present a review of the potential benefits, limitations, and risks of SILS in biliary and pancreatic diseases. There are many studies showing benefits in cholecystectomy. A few case reports have also emerged about its feasibility in procedures such as cystogastrostomy and limited pancreatic resection. Further research and development of this technique is needed to arrive at a tangible conclusion about the perceived benefits of SILS.

The antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were retrieved from the antimicrobial peptide database (APD3) and shortlisted based on certain important physicochemical properties. The binding mode of the shortlisted peptides was measured based on the number of clusters which forms in a protein-peptide docking using Piper. As a result, we identified a list of putative AMPs which binds to the spike protein of MERS-CoV, which may be crucial in providing the inhibitory action. It is observed that seven putative peptides have good binding score based on cluster size cutoff of 208. We conclude that seven peptides, namely, AP00225, AP00180, AP00549, AP00744, AP00729, AP00764, and AP00223, could possibly have binding with the active site of the MERS-CoV spike protein.

We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the community setting and compared three different collection methods. Method: Prospective study conducted in three primary care centres. RT-PCR was performed in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centres: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW) and self-collection (SC). Results: NPS and saliva pairs of samples from 577 patients (median age 39 years, 44% men, 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS and kappa coefficients ({kappa}) for SVC, OPW and SC were 95% ({kappa}=0.85), 93.4% ({kappa}=0.76), and 93.3% ({kappa}=0.76), respectively. The sensitivity (95% CI) of the saliva specimens varied from 86% (72.6-93.7) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4-80) for SC samples. The sensitivity was higher in samples with lower cycle threshold (Ct) values. The best performance of RT-PCR was observed for SVC, with sensitivity (95% CI) for Ct values []32 of 97% (82.5-99.8) in symptomatic, and 88.9% (50.7-99.4) in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: Saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting. Specimens collected under supervision perform comparably to NPS and can effectively identify individuals with higher risk of transmission in real life conditions.","output":"Performance of saliva specimens for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting: does sample collection method matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the peculiar aspects of the transplant patient's life is that, in the post-surgery phase, the patient lives in an \\"isolation\\" condition, having to pay particular attention to the living environment and preferring a limited social life given that the immunosuppressive treatment entails immunodepression in the patient. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19, as in a post-surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started on March 17, 2020, and ended on April 24, 2020. Consulting/phone interviews were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated structure and psychological resistance. Eight patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. RESULTS: In essence, from the overall analysis of the data derived from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function, the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects, and the use of positive personal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V kidney failure are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient.

The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth applications domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner. We implemented smart contracts on an Ethereum consortium blockchain to facilities identification and authentication procedures.

Several clinical guidelines state that people with RMDs should have access to foot health services, although service capacity is often limited. The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for alternative ways to provide patient care. The aim of this clinical audit was to review a newly implemented telephone follow-up appointment service conducted within the Rheumatology Podiatry Department in Leeds, UK. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients attending the Rheumatology Podiatry Department at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust were contacted by telephone approximately 6C8 weeks following initial intervention. During the telephone consultation, all patients were asked pre-defined questions relating to their symptoms, intervention efficacy, the need for further appointments and their preference for the type of consultation. To assess the cost of the telephone consultation the number of attempts needed in order to make successful contact, the duration of the call and the number of telephone follow-up appointments completed in a working day were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (43%) were successfully contacted within the 6C8 weeks stipulated time frame and were included in the analysis. Of the 25 contacted, twelve (48%) patients were successfully contacted on the first attempt. Ten (40%) were successfully contacted on the second attempt. The remaining three patients (12%) required 3 or more attempts to make successful contact. Telephone consultations were estimated not to last longer than 10 min, including notes screening and documentation. Eleven patients (44%) reported an improvement in their symptoms, thirteen (52%) reported no change and one patient (4%) reported their symptoms to be worse. CONCLUSION: Telephone follow-up consultations may be a potentially cost-effective alternative to face-to-face appointments when implemented in a Rheumatology Podiatry Department, and provide an alternative way of providing care, especially when capacity for face-to-face contact is limited. The potential cost saving and efficiency benefits of this service are likely to be enhanced when telephone consultations are pre-arranged with patients.

Two kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates of 220 children diagnosed with viral pneumonia were obtained. Two kinds of multiplex PCR (Seeplex? RV detection kit, and Labopass? RV detection kit), and a shell vial culture by R-Mix were performed. RESULTS: Positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%, respectively. We also cultured 103 samples that showed positive results of the adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by two multiplex PCR. The RSV was most frequently detected in 53.0% (Seeplex) and 51.7% (Labopass) of patients. The detection rate of adenovirus (AdV) was 10.3% and 12.1%, influenza virus (IFV) A and B was 12.5% and 3.4%, and parainfluenza virus (PIFV) 1, 2, and 3 were 2.9% and 2.6%. Shell vial cultures showed concordant results with each multiplex PCR by 96.1% and 77.7%, respectively. Sequencing results were 90% consistent with multiplex PCR.

However, a detailed qualitative study of the role of simulation in ophthalmic surgical education has not previously been conducted. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of trainee ophthalmologists and ophthalmic surgeon educators use of simulation, and the perceived challenges in surgical training. METHODS: A multi-center, multi-country qualitative study was conducted between October 2017 and August 2020. Trainee ophthalmologists from six training centers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa) participated in semi-structured interviews, before and after an intense simulation training course in intraocular surgery. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with experienced ophthalmic surgeon educators. Interviews were anonymized, recorded, transcribed and coded. An inductive, bottom-up, constant comparative method was used for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven trainee ophthalmologists and 12 ophthalmic surgeon educators were included in the study and interviewed. The benefits and challenges of conventional surgical teaching, attributes of surgical educators, value of simulation in training and barriers to implementing ophthalmic surgical simulation were identified as major themes. Almost all trainees and trainers reported patient safety, a calm environment, the possibility of repetitive practice, and facilitation of reflective learning as beneficial aspects of ophthalmic SBSE. Perceived barriers in surgical training included a lack of surgical cases, poor supervision and limited simulation facilities.

In the present study, atmospheric zinc (Zn) emissions from eight CFPPs with different kinds of boilers and air pollution control devices (APCDs) in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, were investigated as well as the partitioning of this metal among boilers and APCDs. During the investigation of a CFPP, samples were taken of input and output materials during the same period. Our results give a Zn content of 32-165 mg kg-1 for feed coal, 52-237 mg kg-1 for bottom ash, 108-725 mg kg-1 for fly ash, 1.2-6.0 mg kg-1 for limestone, 1.6-7.3 mg kg-1 for gypsum, and 1.39-7.06 g Nm-3 for stack gas. Most of the zinc content in the feed coal goes with the flue gas after combustion and amounts to 94.2-96.1% and 60.5-78.1% for pulverized coal-fired boilers (PC) and circulating fluidized bed boilers (CFB), respectively. Based on input Zn, a larger share (80.8-96.4%) ends up the captured fly ash of PC boilers than the case of CFB boilers (66.1-73.6%). In turn, a minor portion is captured into the flue gas desulfurization gypsum, while we found a maximum of 0.05 is emitted into the atmosphere.

Taking advantage of Denmark's high RT-PCR testing and whole genome sequencing capacities, we used national health register data to assess the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in individuals infected with B.1.1.7 compared with those with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. METHODS: We did an observational cohort study of all SARS-CoV-2-positive cases confirmed by RT-PCR in Denmark, sampled between Jan 1 and March 24, 2021, with 14 days of follow-up for COVID-19 hospitalisation. Cases were identified in the national COVID-19 surveillance system database, which includes data from the Danish Microbiology Database (RT-PCR test results), the Danish COVID-19 Genome Consortium, the National Patient Registry, the Civil Registration System, as well as other nationwide registers. Among all cases, COVID-19 hospitalisation was defined as first admission lasting longer than 12 h within 14 days of a sample with a positive RT-PCR result. The study population and main analysis were restricted to the proportion of cases with viral genome data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) of admission according to infection with B.1.1.7 versus other co-existing lineages with a Poisson regression model with robust SEs, adjusted a priori for sex, age, calendar time, region, and comorbidities. The contribution of each covariate to confounding of the crude RR was evaluated afterwards by a stepwise forward inclusion. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and March 24, 2021, 50 958 individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and at least 14 days of follow-up for hospitalisation were identified; 30 572 (600%) had genome data, of whom 10 544 (345%) were infected with B.1.1.7. 1944 (64%) individuals had a COVID-19 hospitalisation and of these, 571 (294%) had a B.1.1.7 infection and 1373 (706%) had an infection with other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although the overall number of hospitalisations decreased during the study period, the proportion of individuals infected with B.1.1.7 increased from 35% to 921% per week. B.1.1.7 was associated with a crude RR of hospital admission of 079 (95% CI 072C087; p<00001) and an adjusted RR of 142 (95% CI 125C160; p<00001). The adjusted RR was increased in all strata of age and calendar periodthe two covariates with the largest contribution to confounding of the crude RR. INTERPRETATION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation compared with that of other lineages in an analysis adjusted for covariates.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: sing the electronic medical records of an academic healthcare institution in central Pennsylvania, we obtained names and addresses of patients who had been an inpatient or outpatient within the prior three years, were 18 years or older, and who resided in a community defined as rural by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The survey included three statements about the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, an open-ended question about concerns regarding the vaccine, and validated scales for general trust and for distrust in healthcare organizations. All study variables were summarized to determine their distributions, and then bivariate binomial logistic regression analyses were conducted. Responses to the open-ended question were coded and used as variables in the bivariate analysis. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Respondents reporting conservative political views were more likely (compared to those liberal political views) to never want to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Those who expressed distrust in healthcare organizations were less likely to want to be vaccinated soon. Conversely those who were more trusting said they were more likely to want to be vaccinated soon. Respondents dominant concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine were that it was new and that the process for its development was rushed. Respondents who believed that COVID-19 was a hoax were unlikely to ever want to be vaccinated, while those who distrusted the process in some way (new vaccine or rushed vaccine) were more likely to want to wait to be vaccinated.

In addition, we construct massive occluded face images to train FROM effectively and efficiently. FROM is simple yet powerful compared to the existing methods that either rely on external detectors to discover the occlusions or employ shallow models which are less discriminative.

The effects of vitamin and micronutrient supplements on the prevention and treatment of COVID- 19 seems challenging in scientific considerations. On the other side generally, experts warn against over-consumption of these supplements. Materials and methods: This study aimed to investigate the vitamin and micronutrient supplementation usage pattern in past history of patients with COVID-19 via a cross-sectional inquiry. Totally 510 patients referring to the infectious disease clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran from March 2020 to May 2020 were recruited. The inclusion criterion was suspected patients for COVID-19 based on clinical findings and CT scans of the lung. The infected patients included both inpatients (171) and outpatients (339). Demographic information, clinical signs, and the supplement pattern use were collected through a questionnaire and the data were statistically analyzed. Results: Vitamin D3 intake was reported in 30% (103 patients) of outpatients and 16.5% (28 patients) of hospitalized patients, which is statistically significant (P=0.001). It shows that, the frequency of vitamin D3 consumption in the outpatient group was higher than inpatient group. This significant difference has also been shown in zinc consumption, in 29 patients (9%) outpatients versus 4 patients (2%) inpatients were reported (P=0.007). Multi nominal regression showed that vitamin D3 intake has a supportive effect and reduces the risk of exacerbation and worsening of the disease. (OR=0.291; 95% CI 0.102-.0834, P=0.022). Conclusion: According to the results of the present study and the findings of other studies, considering the supportive effect of vitamin D3 in reducing the severity of infectious diseases; Clinical trials with an appropriate sample size are recommended to investigate the functional role of this vitamin in improving viral diseases of the respiratory tract.","output":"Supplement Usage Pattern in a Group of COVID- 19 Patients in Tehran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the legal rules governing the causal factors and actions taken by the Delitua Police in the event of a criminal act during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Intranasal exposure of mice to AlsPV resulted in no clinical signs of disease, although viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure. Oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding in respiratory secretions, and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain. These results imply that AlsPV may be similar to PIV5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species.

Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments. Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess. We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the worlds fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (Chelodina longicollis) that people interact with regularly or have as pets. Chelodina longicollis utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation. Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss. Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that 40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation. Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes. Urban wetlands (natural and constructed) may provide biodiversity arks for endangered species and facilitate community led conservation programs.","output":"Quantifying Costs of Urbanisation: Wetland Loss and Impacts in a Rapidly Developing Global City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cultured meat is an emerging technology with the potential to solve huge challenges related to the environmental, ethical, and health implications of conventional meat production. Establishing the basic science of cultured meat has been the primary focus of the last decade but it is now feasible that cultured meat products will enter the market within the next 3 to 4 years. This proximity to market introduction demands an evaluation of aspects of the cultured meat production process that have not yet been outlined or discussed in significant detail. For example, one technological approach for the production of cultured meat uses adult muscle stem cells, the limited proliferative capacity of which necessitates repeated collection of tissue samples via biopsies of living donor animals. The selection of donor animals and the details of biopsy processes must be optimized, as this is a key bottleneck in the cultured meat production process. The number of stem cells harvested from a biopsy, together with their proliferative capacity, determines a multiplicity factor achieved by a cultured meat production process, thus dictating the reduction in number of animals required to produce a given quantity of meat. This article considers potential scenarios for these critical upstream steps, focusing on the production of cultured beef as an example. Considerations related to donor selection and details of the biopsy process are discussed in detail. The practicalities of various scenarios for cultured beef production, the health of donor animals, and regulatory issues associated with the safety of cultured meat for consumers are also considered. ? 2020 The Authors.

METHODS: Patients who described new-onset olfactory dysfunction, who were treated in the COVID-19 departments of our hospital and whose PCR tests demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 presence were included in the study and they were investigated prospectively. Clinical information of all the patients was taken and the levels of olfactory function were detected using the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Scores equal to or below 8 are considered as olfactory dysfunction. Patients who were followed up for 3 months were reevaluated with the BSIT test at the end of the third month and the progression of the symptom was investigated. RESULTS: The mean BSIT test score of the 42 patients (23 female patients, 19 male patients, mean age: 41.2  14.6) was 5.2  2.2. There was severe olfactory dysfunction in 16.7% of the patients (0C2 points), moderate olfactory dysfunction in 31% (3C5 points), and mild olfactory dysfunction in 52.4% (6C8 points). After a follow-up for 3 months, full recovery was observed in 36 patients (85.7%) and the mean test score rose to 9.9  1.8. Although olfactory dysfunction persisted in 6 patients, an elevation in test scores was noted. Olfactory dysfunction was the first symptom in 17 patients (40%) and the other symptoms occurred after 2 days (1C6) on average. CONCLUSION: We investigated olfactory dysfunction caused by COVID-19 using BSIT, and found a high rate of moderate-mild level symptoms with a high level of recovery in the 3-month follow-up.

We aim to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. METHODS: Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42 hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100, mortality can be reduced to 60% or less. Prolonged interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent mortality.

The spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present on the surface of the virion mediates the virus entry into the host cells and therefore is targeted by several scientific groups as a novel drug target site. The spike glycoprotein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) cell surface receptor abundantly expressed in lung tissues, and this binding phenomenon is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. The binding and internalization of the virus is the primary and most crucial step in the process of infection, and therefore the molecules targeting the inhibition of this process certainly hold a significant therapeutic value. Thus, we systematically applied the computational techniques to identify the plausible inhibitor from a chosen set of well characterized diaryl pyrimidine analogues which may disrupt interfacial interaction of spike glycoprotein (S) at the surface of hACE2. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation, we have identified AP-NP (2-(2-amino-5-(naphthalen-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol), AP-3-OMe-Ph (2-(2-amino-5-(3-methoxyphenyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol) and AP-4-Me-Ph (2-(2-amino-5-(p-tolyl) pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol) from a group of diaryl pyrimidine derivatives which appears to bind at the interface of the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy.

People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018-19 and June-July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. FINDINGS: Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 178 [95% CI 144-219]; p<00001), anxiety (223 [172-289]; p<00001), and loneliness (152 [126-184]; p<00001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (144 [120-172]; p<00001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (070 [055-089]; p=00037) and written social contact (054 [045-064]; p<00001) with family than people without ADL impairment. Results for social contact were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. INTERPRETATION: People with physical disability might be at particular risk for emotional distress, poor quality of life, and low wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for additional support and targeted mental health services.

The electrically-driven transport of free ions under such conditions is far from being understood. In this paper, we determine experimentally whether the above-mentioned deviation from isotropy affects the electric charge transport across the liquid. To this end, we measure the electrical conductivity in the flow (stretching) direction of the cylindrical liquid filament formed in the elasto-capillary thinning that arises during the breakup of a viscoelastic liquid bridge. First, we examine the behavior of monodisperse solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in a mixture of glycerine and water. For all the concentrations and molecular weights considered, the filament conductivity remains practically the same as the isotropic conductivity measured under hydrostatic conditions. However, we observe a decrease in the electric current at the end of elasto-capillary regime which may partially be attributed to the reduction of the liquid conductivity. Then, we measure the conductivity of bidisperse solutions of PEO with very different molecular weights. In this case, a significant decrease in conductivity is observed as the filament radius decreases. This constitutes the first experimental evidence of ion mobility reduction in stretching viscoelastic filaments, a relevant effect in applications such as electrospinning.","output":"Electrical Conductivity of a Stretching Viscoelastic Filament"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Marburg virus (MARV) causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates and has a high mortality rate.

Multiple additional topics are also covered, such as the effect of antibody on the expression of viral proteins both on the surface of the cell and intracellularly. Serum antibody, produced in response to virus infections, is of major importance in preventing the spread of infection by virtue of neutralizing free virus in extracellular fluids. Virus neutralization by antibody is enhanced by complement. Antibody binding to the surface of virus-infected cells can affect virus production and release in the absence of an effector system. Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody can mediate the destruction of virus-infected cells in conjunction with complement or cytotoxic lymphocytes. In addition, at a conceptual level there is evidence to suggest that antibody may enhance and confer specificity on basic nonspecific humoral and cell-mediated defense mechanisms.","output":"Antibody-Mediated Destruction of Virus-Infected Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Outbreak of COVID-19 has been recognized as a global health concern since it causes high rates of morbidity and mortality. No specific antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 till date. Drug repurposing strategy helps to find out the drugs for COVID-19 treatment from existing FDA approved antiviral drugs. In this study, FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were repurposed against the major viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The 3D structures of FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were retrieved from PubChem. Virtual screening was performed to find out the lead antiviral drug molecules against main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using COVID-19 Docking Server. Furthermore, lead molecules were individually docked against protein targets using AutoDock 4.0.1 software and their drug-likeness and ADMET properties were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 65 FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs screened, Raltegravir showed highest interaction energy value of -9 kcal/mol against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and Indinavir, Tipranavir, and Pibrentasvir exhibited a binding energy value of &#8805;-8 kcal/mol. Similarly Indinavir showed the highest binding energy of -11.5 kcal/mol against the target protein RdRp and Dolutegravir, Elbasvir, Tipranavir, Taltegravir, Grazoprevir, Daclatasvir, Glecaprevir, Ledipasvir, Pibrentasvir and Velpatasvir showed a binding energy value in range from -8 to -11.2 kcal/mol. The antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine also exhibited good bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the screened small molecule antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine could serve as potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with further validation studies.","output":"Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine against main protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2: A molecular docking and drug repurposing approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recognition of molecular diversity of cell surface proteomes in disease is essential for the development of targeted therapies. Progress in targeted therapeutics requires establishing effective approaches for high-throughput identification of agents specific for clinically relevant cell surface markers. Over the past decade, a number of platform strategies have been developed to screen polypeptide libraries for ligands targeting receptors selectively expressed in the context of various cell surface proteomes. Streamlined procedures for identification of ligand-receptor pairs that could serve as targets in disease diagnosis, profiling, imaging and therapy have relied on the display technologies, in which polypeptides with desired binding profiles can be serially selected, in a process called biopanning, based on their physical linkage with the encoding nucleic acid. These technologies include virus/phage display, cell display, ribosomal display, mRNA display and covalent DNA display (CDT), with phage display being by far the most utilized. The scope of this review is the recent advancements in the display technologies with a particular emphasis on molecular mapping of cell surface proteomes with peptide phage display. Prospective applications of targeted compounds derived from display libraries in the discovery of targeted drugs and gene therapy vectors are discussed.","output":"Display technologies: application for the discovery of drug and gene delivery agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world-wide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was triggered by the widespread of a new strain of coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, the molecular pathogenesis of the virus and related diseases has still not been fully revealed. In this study, we attempted to identify new transcriptomic signatures as candidate diagnostic models for clinical testing or as therapeutic targets for vaccine design. Using the recently reported transcriptomics data of upper airway tissue with acute respiratory illnesses, we integrated multiple machine learning methods to identify effective qualitative biomarkers and quantitative rules for the distinction of SARS-CoV-2 infection from other infectious diseases. The transcriptomics data was first analyzed by Boruta so that important features were selected, which were further evaluated by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method. A feature list was produced. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection, incorporating some classification algorithms, to extract qualitative biomarker genes and construct quantitative rules. Also, an efficient classifier was built to identify patients infected with SARS-COV-2.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the adjusted effect of body mass index (BMI), associated comorbidities, time, neighborhood-level sociodemographic factors, and other factors on risk for death due to COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care organization. PATIENTS: Kaiser Permanente Southern California members diagnosed with COVID-19 from 13 February to 2 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Poisson regression estimated the adjusted effect of BMI and other factors on risk for death at 21 days; models were also stratified by age and sex. RESULTS: Among 6916 patients with COVID-19, there was a J-shaped association between BMI and risk for death, even after adjustment for obesity-related comorbidities. Compared with patients with a BMI of 18.5 to 24 kg/m(2), those with BMIs of 40 to 44 kg/m(2) and greater than 45 kg/m(2) had relative risks of 2.68 (95% CI, 1.43 to 5.04) and 4.18 (CI, 2.12 to 8.26), respectively. This risk was most striking among those aged 60 years or younger and men. Increased risk for death associated with Black or Latino race/ethnicity or other sociodemographic characteristics was not detected. LIMITATION: Deaths occurring outside a health care setting and not captured in membership files may have been missed. CONCLUSION: Obesity plays a profound role in risk for death from COVID-19, particularly in male patients and younger populations. Our capitated system with more equalized health care access may explain the absence of effect of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities on death. Our data highlight the leading role of severe obesity over correlated risk factors, providing a target for early intervention.

METHODS: This online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was distributed to 480 oncosurgeons across India. We used &#967;2 statistics to compare responses across geographical areas (COVID-19 lockdown zones and city tiers) and type of organization (government/private, academic/nonacademic, and dedicated/multispecialty hospitals). P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Total of 256 (53.3%) oncologists completed the survey. About 206 hospitals in 85 cities had screening clinics (98.1%), COVID-19 dedicated committees (73.7%), ward (67.3%), ICU's (49%), and OR's (36%). Such preparedness was higher in tier-1 cities, government, academic, and multispecialty hospitals. Dedicated cancer institutes continued major surgeries in all oncological subspecialties particularly in head and neck (P = .006) and colorectal oncology (P = .04). Employee well-being was better in government hospitals. CONCLUSION: Hospitals have implemented strategies to continue cancer care.

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Carver Brief COPE Inventory, and the Death Attitude Profile-Revised were used. The results indicated that escape acceptance might be the most maladaptive death attitude during COVID-19, as it was related to poorer mental health among the Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish psychology students. Self-blame, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and substance use coping styles were also related to poorer mental health, whereas positive-reframing (only among the Hungarian and Turkish participants) and humor (only among the Norwegian participants) were related to better mental health among our sample in the context of COVID-19. The findings implied that death attitudes and coping styles may differ in their efficacy among the Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish participants. These differences were discussed in detail in the discussion part. During the pandemic, practitioners might pay closer attention to patients with higher escape acceptance death attitude and patients who use dysfunctional coping styles.

Interestingly, daily life satisfaction increased during the lockdown. At the beginning of the experiment, subjects were asked to guess the end-week of the lockdown, against a possible monetary reward for accurate forecasts. Subjects predicting a longer lockdown period reported a higher average level of daily life satisfaction. Females reported on average lower levels of daily life satisfaction, but exhibited a stronger tendency to report higher levels of life satisfaction, the longer their lockdown forecast. Individual heterogeneity in life satisfaction levels can be partly attributed to personality traits, with neuroticism having a negative effect, while extraversion and agreeableness having a positive effect on daily life satisfaction.","output":"When Will the Lockdown End?

Here, we show that the effector BspF specifically promotes Brucella replication within rBCVs by interfering with vesicular transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endocytic compartment. BspF targeted the recycling endosome, inhibited retrograde traffic to the TGN, and interacted with the Arf6 GTPase-activating Protein (GAP) ACAP1 to dysregulate Arf6-/Rab8a-dependent transport within the recycling endosome, which resulted in accretion of TGN-associated vesicles by rBCVs and enhanced bacterial growth. Altogether, these findings provide mechanistic insight into bacterial modulation of membrane transport used to promote their own proliferation within intracellular vacuoles.","output":"A Brucella effector modulates the Arf6-Rab8a GTPase cascade to promote intravacuolar replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease (COVID 19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Although many discovery-based T cell biomarkers have been described, to date, no such markers have been widely adopted in standard practice. The heterogeneous nature of T1D and lack of standardized assays and experimental design across studies is a major barrier to the broader adoption of T cell immunophenotyping assays. There is an unmet need to harmonize the design of immunophenotyping assays, including those that measure antigen-agnostic cell populations, such that data collected from different clinical trial sites and T1D cohorts are comparable, yet account for cohort-specific features and different drug mechanisms of action. In these Guidelines, we aim to provide expert advice on how to unify aspects of study design and practice. We provide recommendations for defining cohorts, method implementation, as well as tools for data analysis and reporting by highlighting and building on selected successes. Harmonization of cytometry-based T cell assays will allow researchers to better integrate findings across trials, ultimately enabling the identification and validation of biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response in T1D.

Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14/34 HCWs (41%; 40{+/-}14 years, 71% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21%). Mild disease prevailed (79%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28{+/-}18 days), viral shedding (31{+/-}10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29{+/-}28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5{+/-}7.7 vs 5.0{+/-}4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalisation, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1/8) HCW. Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.","output":"A COVID-19 outbreak in a rheumatology department upon the early days of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer (BC) in women under 50 is a potentially traumatic experience that can upset a womans life during a crucial phase of her lifespan.

The model supports university-led efforts by leveraging three elements: (i) inherent synergies across SDGs, (ii) modes of solution identification, design, and implementation, and (iii) modes of stakeholder involvement and interactions. Using an integration of human-centered design (HCD) and shared-action learning (SAL), we document a case led by a large, public, research-oriented university on how different stakeholders participated in the co-creation process to find solutions. Based on the experience of about 50 students over 4 years in support of SDG implementation in Indonesia, the initiative leveraged synergies within SDG 1, 2, and 5 (related to increasing income-generating power for women and indigenous people) and SDG 7 (use of solar energy for fish preservation and crop processing). Throughout the process, interactions with stakeholders took place during design workshop courses, community consultations, mentoring and internships programs, partnering with companies and local universities and government, site visits, and immersions in local communities. The HCD-SAL model established a system for monitoring impacts across all stakeholders, particularly how the projects helped increase communities economic well-being.

We compared the impact of the Delta variant and non-Delta variant on the COVID-19 outcomes in patients from Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. MethodsWe ascertained 161 patients, 69 with the Delta variant and 92 with the non-Delta variant. The Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer was used to perform the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. ResultsThe mean age of patients with Delta and the non-Delta variant was 27.3 {+/-} 20.0 and 43.0 {+/-} 20.9 (p=3x10-6). The patients with Delta variant consisted of 23 males and 46 females, while the patients with the non-Delta variant involved 56 males and 36 females (p=0.001). The Ct value of the Delta variant (18.4 {+/-} 2.9) was significantly lower than the non-Delta variant (19.5 {+/-} 3.8) (p=0.043). There was no significant difference in the hospitalization and mortality of patients with Delta and non-Delta variants (p=0.80 and 0.29, respectively). None of the prognostic factors was associated with the hospitalization, except diabetes with an OR of 3.6 (95% CI=1.02-12.5; p=0.036). Moreover, the patients with the following factors have been associated with higher mortality rate than patients without the factors: age []65 years, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease with the OR of 11 (95% CI=3.4-36; p=8x10-5), 27 (95% CI=6.1-118; p=1x10-5), 15.6 (95% CI=5.3-46; p=6x10-7), 12 (95% CI=4-35.3; p=1.2x10-5), and 6.8 (95% CI=2.1-22.1; p=0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age []65 years, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were the strong prognostic factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients with the OR of 3.6 (95% CI=0.58-21.9; p=0.028), 16.6 (95% CI=2.5-107.1; p=0.003), 5.5 (95% CI=1.3-23.7; p=0.021), and 5.8 (95% CI=1.02-32.8; p=0.047), respectively. ConclusionsWe show that the patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant have a lower Ct value than the patients infected by the non-Delta variant, implying that the Delta variant has a higher viral load, which might cause a more transmissible virus among humans.

However, clinical trials to date have shown contradictory results. This could be attributed to the different patient endotypes and steroid doses, which have also contributed to the inconclusive results. We investigated the effects of glucocorticoid therapy on sepsis in a polymicrobial sepsis model in a variety of settings, such as steroid dose, severity, and sepsis phase. We used a rat model of fecal slurry polymicrobial sepsis. First, we investigated the optimum dose of steroids in a sepsis model. We administered different doses of dexamethasone after sepsis induction (0.1DEX; 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2DEX; 0.2 mg/kg, 5DEX; 5 mg/kg). Second, we used two different severities of the fecal slurry polymicrobial sepsis rat model to examine the effects of the steroids. A moderate or severe model was defined as a survival rate of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. Third, we administered steroids in an early (1 h after sepsis induction) or late phase (25 h after sepsis). In all the experiments, we investigated the survival rates. In the determined optimal model and settings, we measured serum lactate, alanine transferase (ALT), creatinine, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and arterial blood gas. We evaluated the bacterial burden in the blood and spleen. Endotoxin tolerance of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and splenocytes was also investigated to determine the level of immune suppression 24 h after sepsis by measuring TNF- production after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in an ex vivo model. Early treatment of 0.2 mg/kg dexamethasone in a severe sepsis model showed the best beneficial effects. In moderate- or late-phase sepsis, there was no survival gain with steroid treatment. DEX0.2 group showed less acute kidney injury manifested by serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. DEX decreased the levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-. Colony-forming units were significantly decreased in the blood when administered with dexamethasone. Endotoxin tolerance was not significantly different between the DEX0.2 and control groups.

In a life-threatening situation, where there is no specific and licensed anti-COVID-19 vaccine or medicine available; the repurposed drug might act as a silver bullet. Currently, more than 211 vaccines, 80 antibodies, 31 antiviral drugs, 35 cell-based, 6 RNA-based and 131 other drugs are in clinical trials. It is therefore utter need of the hour to develop an effective drug that can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 before a vaccine can be developed. One of the best-characterized and attractive drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (3CLpro). Therefore, the current study focuses on the molecular docking analysis of TAT-peptide47C57 (GRKKRRQRRRP)-conjugated repurposed drugs (i.e., lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine) with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) to discover potential efficacy of TAT-peptide (TP) - conjugated repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking results validated that TP-conjugated ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine have superior and significantly enhanced interactions with the target SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In-silico approach employed in this study suggests that the combination of the drug with TP is an excelling alternative to develop a novel drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The development of TP based delivery of repurposing drugs might be an excellent approach to enhance the efficacy of the existing drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. The predictions from the results obtained provide invaluable information that can be utilized for the choice of candidate drugs for in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. The outcome from this work prove crucial for exploring and developing novel cost-effective and biocompatible TP conjugated anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agents in immediate future.","output":"TAT-peptide conjugated repurposing drug against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro): potential therapeutic intervention to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skeletal muscle dysfunction in survivors of pneumonia disproportionately affects older individuals in whom it causes substantial morbidity. We found that skeletal muscle recovery was impaired in old compared with young mice after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia. In young mice, recovery of muscle loss was associated with expansion of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages and downregulation of MHC II expression, followed by a proliferation of muscle satellite cells. These findings were absent in old mice and in mice deficient in Cx3cr1. Transcriptomic profiling of tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages from old compared with young mice showed downregulation of pathways associated with phagocytosis and proteostasis, and persistent upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Consistently, skeletal muscle macrophages from old mice failed to downregulate MHCII expression during recovery from influenza A virus-induced pneumonia and showed impaired phagocytic function in vitro. Like old animals, mice deficient in the phagocytic receptor Mertk showed no macrophage expansion, MHCII downregulation, or satellite cell proliferation and failed to recover skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia. Our data suggest that a loss of phagocytic function in a CX3CR1+ tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophage population in old mice precludes satellite cell proliferation and recovery of skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia.","output":"Impaired phagocytic function in CX3CR1+ tissue-resident skeletal muscle macrophages prevents muscle recovery after influenza A virus-induced pneumonia in old mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With sizes <50 kb, viral RNA genomes are at the crossroads of genetic, biophysical, and biochemical stability in their host cell.

Since 2004, CCoVs with point mutations or deletions of NSPs are contributing to the changes in tropism and virulence in dogs. RESULTS: In this study, we isolated a CCoV, designated HLJ-071, from a dead 5-week-old female Welsh Corgi with severe diarrhea and vomit. Sequence analysis suggested that HLJ-071 bearing a complete ORF3abc compared with classic CCoV isolates (1-71, K378 and S378). In addition, a variable region was located between S gene and ORF 3a gene, in which a deletion with 104 nts for HLJ-071 when compared with classic CCoV strains 1-71, S378 and K378. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene and complete sequences showed that HLJ-071 was closely related to FCoV II. Recombination analysis suggested that HLJ-071 originated from the recombination of FCoV 79-1683, FCoV DF2 and CCoV A76. Finally, according to cell tropism experiments, it suggested that HLJ-071 could replicate in canine macrophages/monocytes cells. CONCLUSION: The present study involved the isolation and genetic characterization of a variant CCoV strain and spike protein and ORF3abc of CCoV might play a key role in viral tropism, which could affect the replication in monocyte/macrophage cells.

This platform is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and high throughput system. With this platform, we screened two compound libraries of 2,864 molecules and identified three potential anti-coronavirus compounds: tannic acid (TA), TS-1276 (anthraquinone), and TS-984 (9-Methoxycanthin-6-one). Our in vitro validation experiments indicated that TS-984 strongly inhibits the interaction of the coronavirus S-protein and the human cell ACE2 receptor. This data suggests that TS-984 is a potent blocker of the interaction between the S-protein and ACE2, which might have the potential to be developed into an effective anti-coronavirus drug.

After nearly two months, the curve was succesfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually released. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions are not yet available so it is expected that preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, hence the need for well-informed models. In this study, we built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified-SEIRD model with detailed hospital dynamics. Because the hospitalization data for Belgium have not been made public yet by the Belgian scientific institute of public health, we computed the hospitalization parameters based on data from 370 patients in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. The basic reproduction number during March 2020 was estimated as R0 = 2.83 and the model fits the hospitalization and ICU admission incidence under lockdown measures well. In spite of the release of social restrictions, hospitalizations have been steadily declining. We recomputed the basic reproduction number under lockdown release and found that it had to be as low as R0 = 0.73 to explain the endemic trend under the observed community mobility data. We further found that although the basic reproduction number in the population older than 70 years was smaller than one, this group compromises nearly half of the expected hospitalizations.

The reported possible neurological symptoms are varied and range from subtle neurologic deficits to unconsciousness. Knowledge regarding the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of COVID-19-associated neurological damage is still limited. We report a case of serious neurological damage and mental abnormalities in a patient who was finally confirmed to have COVID-19 based on IgM and IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 68-year-old man had slight flu-like symptoms and transient loss of consciousness in early February. Exaggerated unconsciousness and deteriorating mental abnormalities occurred over the next month without severe respiratory symptoms. Craniocerebral computed tomography showed normal results, but antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were 100 times higher in the CSF than in the serum; tests for viral ribonucleic acid showed negative results with both a nasopharyngeal swab and CSF sample. DIAGNOSIS: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed based on symptoms and positive results for IgM and IgG in the CSF. INTERVENTIONS: Antiviral, fluid, and nutritional support were administered for 30 days before admission without obvious improvement. A further 18 days of routine antiviral therapy, immunoglobulin therapy (10 g per day for 5 days), and antipsychotic drug treatment were administered. OUTCOMES: The patient's neurological and mental abnormalities were greatly ameliorated. He was discharged with mild irritability, slight shaking of the hands, and walking fatigue. These symptoms have persisted up to our last follow-up (May 4, 2020). CONCLUSION: We believe this is the first case involving neural system injury in a patient who confirmed COVID-19 based on CSF antibody test results. Negative ribonucleic acid test results, strong positivity for antibodies, and high protein levels in the CSF suggest the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis secondary to COVID-19.

BACKGROUND The Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased strain and workplace-related health risks to intensive care nurses, but it has also provided a unique experience and opportunities for learning and development. METHODS A descriptive qualitative study was conducted with 10 intensive care unit nurses working in seven hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey. Snowball sampling method was used, and the data were collected by semistructured online interviews. A thematic analysis was performed. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research were followed. FINDINGS Five major themes were identified: 'death and fear of death', 'impact on family and social lives', 'nursing care of Covid-19 patients', 'changing perceptions of their own profession: empowerment and dissatisfaction', and 'experiences and perceptions of personal protective equipment and other control measures'. DISCUSSION Intensive care nurses experience an increased risk of infection and psychological burden, and they lack a sense of professional satisfaction. Improvements to working conditions are needed to support nurses caring for patients during the pandemic. CONCLUSION The pandemic increased the workload and responsibilities of intensive care nurses and led to increases in their work-related health risks and challenges with care. However, it also increased nurses' awareness about the importance of their professional roles.

We conducted a prospective study across eight publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). A focus on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids enabled us to scale-up our measurements with a commercial lab partner. Samples were collected daily and results were posted to a website within 24-hours. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in daily samples correlated to incidence COVID-19 cases in the sewersheds; a 1 log10 increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in settled solids corresponds to a 0.58 log10 (4X) increase in sewershed incidence rate.

The virus has a centrally situated nucleic acid, which is encased within a capsid consisting of a protein core. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that live inside cells, using components of the nucleic acid and protein generating system of the host to replicate and trigger cell destruction leading to diseases. Alternatively, the hosts defense mechanisms lead to cell destruction in an attempt to clear cells infected by the viruses. The nucleic acid is RNA or DNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded [1]. The pathophysiology of viral infections may be attributed to the degeneration and cellular necrosis of the infected cells, leading to local and systemic inflammatory responses. The bodys defense mechanisms include phagocytosis, humoral and cell-mediated responses and the production of interferons [2]. Interferons prevent the local spread of viruses, whereas antibodies prevent viremia, ensure long-term immunity and sensitize infected cells to be destroyed by T-cells and macrophages [3, 4].

Design/methodology/approach: The researcher used the Self-Compassion scale prepared by Neff (2003) translated by the researchers, in a sample of 150 students in Egypt, and Multidimensional Students Life Satisfaction Scale, developed by Huebner et al. (1998) translated by the researchers. Findings: The results of the study showed that self-compassion is high in university students. The study also showed a negative correlation with the dimension of psychological self-judgment and life satisfaction, as it indicated the possibility of predicting life satisfaction through the dimensions of self-compassion, except for the dimensions of isolation and autism, and excessive communication with the self. It also indicated that there are no differences between males and females as far as the variable of self-compassion, as well as the absence of differences between males and females as far as the variable of satisfaction with life is concerned. However, the family dimension showed a difference in favor of males. Originality/value: The inclusion of extension programs to develop self-compassion for various segments of society in light of the continuing corona pandemic, and paying attention to religious counseling programs that support the use of spiritual values in self-strengthening which is reflected in the strengthening of psychological resilience and thus a sense of satisfaction with life. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Self-compassion: the influences on the university students life satisfaction during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropathies in cats are mostly acquired.

Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has been determined to be a feasible, safe, and effective procedure in an experienced surgeon's hands, but the adaptations to the clumsy instruments are needed. The improved dexterity of the Da Vinci robotic system provides a good opportunity to perform this challenging procedure in the minimally invasive context. The aim of this study was to share our preliminary experience of totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy. From April 2015 to August 2015, four patients were selected to undergo totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Department of Pancreatic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. The demographic characteristics, perioperative details, and pathological results were retrospectively reviewed. One female and two male patients underwent totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy, while another male patient underwent robotic total pancreatectomy due to the severe atrophy of pancreatic body and tail. The mean age of the four patients was 56.8 years. The average operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 563 min and 228 mL, respectively. No one needed blood transfusion, conversion to open pancreaticoduodenectomy, or postoperative analgesia. The postoperative courses of these patients were uneventful. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 10 days. No one required to be readmitted, and there was no death within 30 days following the surgery. Final pathologic examinations revealed one malignant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and three benign lesions. Based on this initial study, robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy is safe and feasible, with acceptable oncological outcomes for highly selected patients in experienced surgeons' hands.

A considerable proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Therefore, different polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rapid antigen test (RAT)-based approaches are being discussed and applied to identify infectious cases that would have gone undetected (e.g., in nursing homes). In this article, we provide a framework to estimate the time-dependent risk of being infectious after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test and we simulate the number of expected cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested negative. Methods. A Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate infections that occurred over a one-week period in populations with 1,000 individuals following a negative SARS-Cov-2 test. Parameters representing the application of PCR tests or RATs are utilized, and SARS-CoV-2 7-day incidences between 25 and 200 per 100,000 people are considered. Simulation results are compared to case numbers predicted via a mathematical equation. Results. The simulations showed a linear increase in cases over time in populations of individuals who initially tested SARS-CoV-2 negative. The different false negative rates of PCR tests and RATs have a strong impact on the number of simulated cases. The simulated and the mathematically predicted case numbers were comparable. However, Monte Carlo simulations highlight that, due to random effects, infectious cases can exceed predicted case numbers even shortly after a test was conducted. Conclusions. The analysis demonstrates that the number of infectious cases in a population can be effectively reduced by the screening of asymptomatic individuals. However, the time since the negative test and the underlying SARS-CoV-2 incidence are critical parameters in determining the observed subsequent number of cases in tested populations.","output":"Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR or rapid antigen test result and the subsequent risk of being infectious: a mathematical simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the complete genome sequences of 19 coronavirus genomes, we analyzed the codon usage bias, dinucleotide relative abundance and cytosine deamination in coronavirus genomes.

METHOD A population-based study was conducted of obese patients (BMI  30 kg/m2) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for developing OSA according to other clinicopathological characteristics. Multivariate analysis was conducted of individual factors that affect the propensity to develop OSA. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS From 276,600 obese patients identified during a data extraction of the CPRD in July 2017, the prevalence of OSA was 5.4%. The following risk factors were found to be independently associated with increased likelihood of OSA: male sex (OR = 3.273; p < 0.001), BMI class II (OR = 1.640; p < 0.001), BMI class III (OR = 3.768; p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.179; p < 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.722; p < 0.001), GERD (OR = 1.557; p < 0.001), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.311; p < 0.001), acromegaly (OR = 3.543; p < 0.001), and benzodiazepine use (OR = 1.492; p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced risk of OSA amongst this obese population (OR = 0.260; p < 0.001).

One of the most interesting aspects of the United States of Americas (USAs) experience of the Spanish flu pandemic was the degree to which political agendas shaped local responses. Some cities prioritised public health over almost every other consideration. Others prioritised the local economy and the war effort. Cities that prioritised public health generally experienced less death and suffering than those that did not. Early Twentieth Century politics influenced how the Spanish flu pandemic proceeded.

Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images. However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this, motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19 and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2) the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19 diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.

Outcomes included medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI), influenza hospitalization, and Oseltamivir prescriptions. We estimated difference-in-differences (DIDs) in 2014C15, 2015C16, and 2016C17 using generalized linear models and adjusted for race, ethnicity, age, sex, health plan, and language. RESULTS: Pre-intervention member characteristics were similar between sites.

In both cases, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the coronaviral replication complex dictates the primary polymerase activity by cooperating with cofactors.

The hazard ratio increased proportionately in combination with high AAT and high hsCRP levels, and the highest hazard ratio reached 4.51 (95% confidence interval, 3.14C6.54, P < 0.001).

In the literature, there are evidences that traumatic global events, such as natural catastrophes and pandemic, have negative effects on the physical and psychological health of the population. We carried out a survey to analyze the physical and psychological conditions of Italians during the pandemic. Due to the severe limitations in moving during the phase one lockdown, the survey was administered by internet. Results show that Italians followed the provisions established by the Italian government to avoid contamination, but 43% of them declared to have suffered from physical symptoms, in particular migraine, sleep disorders, persistent exhaustion, and difficulty of concentration. They have great fear to be contaminated or that relatives or friends can be contaminated, and they actively take actions to avoid contamination. Participants declared that they had suffered a lot of inconveniences due to restrictions in their movements, and that their life habits were strongly changed. They spent their time at home in different activities, but their psychological well-being was strongly impaired by the lockdown. The level of anxiety tripled, in relation to the prepandemic period, and 30% of males and 41% of females declared to have severe levels of depression. Participants with high levels of optimism and hopefulness show a stronger resilience against anxiety and depression. In addition, there is a negative correlation between anxiety and depression and the five factors of personality.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.","output":"Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza control along poultry market chains in South China: The value of social network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To retrospectively analyze the pulmonary computed tomography (CT) characteristics and dynamic changes in the lungs of cured coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at discharge and reexamination. METHODS: A total of 155 cured COVID-19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from February 1, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent pulmonary CT at discharge and at 2 weeks after discharge (during reexamination at hospital). A retrospective analysis was performed using these two pulmonary CT scans of the cured patients to observe changes in the number, distribution, morphology, and density of lesions. RESULTS: At discharge, the lung CT images of 15 cured patients showed no obvious lesions, while those of the remaining 140 patients showed different degrees of residual lesions. Patients with moderate disease mostly had multiple pulmonary lesions, mainly in the lower lobes of both lungs. At reexamination, the lung lesions in the patients with moderate disease had significantly improved (P<0.05), and the lung lesions in the patients with severe disease had partially improved, especially in patients with multi-lobe involvement (&#967; 2 =3.956, P<0.05).

Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. METHODS: We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. RESULTS: We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis--vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. CONCLUSIONS: In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030.","output":"Advancing sustainable development goals through immunization: a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: How health researchers find secondary data to analyse is unclear. We sought to describe the approaches that UK organisations take to help researchers find data and to assess the findability of health data that are available for research. METHODS: We surveyed established organisations about how they make data findable. We derived measures of findability based on the first element of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible). We applied these to 13 UK health datasets and measured their findability via two major internet search engines in 2018 and repeated in 2021. RESULTS: Among 12 survey respondents, 11 indicated that they made metadata publicly available. Respondents said internet presence was important for findability, but that this needed improvement. In 2018, 8 out of 13 datasets were listed in the top 100 search results of 10 searches repeated on both search engines, while the remaining 5 were found one click away from those search results. In 2021, this had reduced to seven datasets directly listed and one dataset one click away. In 2021, Google Dataset Search had become available, which listed 3 of the 13 datasets within the top 100 search results. DISCUSSION: Measuring findability via online search engines is one method for evaluating efforts to improve findability. Findability could perhaps be improved with catalogues that have greater inclusion of datasets, field-level metadata and persistent identifiers.

We propose that speech-language pathologists can use the widespread experience of social isolation as a learning catalyst in the effort to shift the LTC culture to one that more highly values a communicative environment that is accessible to all, thereby reducing risk of social isolation for those with communication disorders. Conclusions Many training paradigms for promoting an accessible communicative environment are available in the speech-language pathology literature, yet institutional barriers exist for their widespread implementation. Overcoming these barriers is a challenge that requires awareness and learning on the part of staff and administration regarding the impact of an unfriendly communicative environment on social isolation, and the resulting psychosocial consequences. Learning theory indicates that new learning in adults is motivated by connections between personal experiences and the material to be learned. Explicitly infusing established training programs with the experience of social isolation brought on by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic may be the key needed for changing the communicative environment in LTC.","output":"Experiences of Social Distancing During Coronavirus Disease 2019 as a Catalyst for Changing Long-Term Care Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Identifying risk factors disease characteristics, severity and mortality of COVID-19 are poorly clear, particularly in Egypt brbrObjectives:","output":"Characteristics, Outcomes and Indicators of Severity for COVID-19 Infection Among Sample of ESNA Quarantine Hospital's Patients, Egypt: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives of this study were to explore the content of web-based communication on COVID-19 by religious authorities (RAs) in Uganda and to assess the level of integration of the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) and World Health Organisation (WHO) COVID-19 risk communication guidelines into the statements released by these RAs.

We explored whether general anaesthesia rates for caesarean section changed during the peak of the pandemic across six maternity units in the north-west of England. We analysed anaesthetic information for 2480 caesarean sections across six maternity units from 1 April to 1 July 2020 (during the pandemic) and compared this information with data from 2555 caesarean sections performed at the same hospitals over a similar period in 2019. Primary outcome was change in general anaesthesia rate for caesarean section. Secondary outcomes included overall caesarean section rates, obstetric indications for caesarean section and regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates. A significant reduction (7.7 to 3.7%, p < 0.0001) in general anaesthetic rates, risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.39-0.93), was noted across hospitals during the pandemic. Regional to general anaesthesia conversion rates reduced (1.7 to 0.8%, p = 0.012), risk ratio (95%CI) 0.50 (0.29-0.86).

Since LCL are latently infected with EBV, they provide a model system to investigate EBV latency and virus-driven B cell proliferation and tumorigenesis(1). LCL have been used to present antigens in a variety of immunologic assays(2, 3). In addition, LCL can be used to generate human monoclonal antibodies(4, 5) and provide a potentially unlimited source when access to primary biologic materials is limited(6, 7). A variety of methods have been described to generate LCL. Earlier methods have included the use of mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide(8), and pokeweed mitogen(9) to increase the efficiency of EBV-mediated immortalization. More recently, others have used immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A to inhibit T cell-mediated killing of infected B cells(7, 10-12). The considerable length of time from EBV infection to establishment of cell lines drives the requirement for quicker and more reliable methods for EBV-driven B cell growth transformation. Using a combination of high titer EBV and an immunosuppressive agent, we are able to consistently infect, transform, and generate LCL from B cells in peripheral blood. This method uses a small amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are infected in vitroclusters of cells can be demonstrated. The presence of CD23 with EBV in the presence of FK506, a T cell immunosuppressant.

We observed a higher number of eosinophils and increased extracellular ECP in the mucosa of IBS patients compared with HC. Moreover, F-EDN levels in IBS samples were elevated compared with HC and positively correlated to extracellular ECP. Metagenomic analysis showed significant correlations between bacterial composition and eosinophil measurements in both HC and IBS patients. In vitro experiments revealed an increased degranulation of 15HL-60 after stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, and Yersinia enterocolitica. To conclude, we could demonstrate alterations related to eosinophils in IBS, and, for the first time, a positive correlation between F-EDN levels and degranulated eosinophils in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients. Together our results suggest that eosinophils play a role in the pathophysiology of IBS and the mechanisms might be linked to an altered microbiota.","output":"Elevated F-EDN correlates with mucosal eosinophil degranulation in patients with IBS-A possible association with microbiota?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cognition affects poststroke recovery, but meta-analyses of cognition have not yet provided a comparison of observational and intervention evidence. OBJECTIVE To describe the trajectory of poststroke cognition and the factors that moderate it across intervention and observational cohorts. METHODS Six databases were searched up to January 2020. Studies describing quantitative changes in cognition in adults poststroke were included. Interventions were classified into pharmacological, therapist-led, nonroutine/alternative, and usual care. Summary estimates were compared via hierarchical mixed-effects models. Age, recovery stage, stroke etiology, cognitive domain targeted in studies, and intervention types were investigated as moderators of cognition. Recovery stage and intervention were further analyzed in a multiplicative metaregression model. RESULTS A total of 43 intervention trials and 79 observation cohorts involving 28 222 stroke participants were included. Heterogeneity was significant (2 = 0.09; CI = 0.01-0.21, P < .001) with no evidence of publication bias. Cognitive recovery was greater in intervention trials (g = 0.47; CI = 0.37-0.58) than observational cohorts (g = 0.28; CI = 0.20-0.36) across all moderators analyzed. Nonroutine/alternative and pharmacological trials achieved the best overall results (g = 0.57, CI = 0.42-0.73, and g = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.74, respectively), followed by therapist-led (g = 0.46; CI = 0.17-0.74), and usual care (g = 0.28; CI = 0.11-0.45) interventions. Medium recovery effects (ie, g  0.5) were observed in examining first-ever stroke, executive function, visuo-perceptual, consciousness, and psychomotor skills, 61 to 180 days poststroke, in participants aged 65 to 70 years. CONCLUSION Cognitive recovery is possible using different controlled interventions in all recovery stages, with smaller benefits 2 years poststroke.

Methods All mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated on ICU between March 2020 and January 2021 were included. Respiratory specimens were tested for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, 2 and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) by quantitative real-time PCR. Clinical parameters were compared in the cohorts with and without HSV-1- infection. Results 134 patients with a median age of 72.5 years (73.0% male, n=98) were included. HSV-1 reactivation occurred in 61 patients (45.5%), after median 9 (7-13) days of mechanical ventilation. The main factor for reactivation was length of stay on ICU (24 days vs 13 days, p<0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (417 vs 214 hours, p<0.001). Treatment with dexamethasone and a history of immunosuppression did not associate with HSV-infection in the univariate analysis (39 vs 41, p=0.462 and 27.9% vs 23.3%, p=0.561, respectively). Both ICU and hospital mortality were not significantly different in the cohorts with and without HSV-infection (57.4% vs 45.2%, p=0.219). Conclusions Our study shows a high prevalence of HSV-infection in critically-ill COVID-19 patients which was unexpectedly higher than the prevalence of CMV-infections and unrelated to dexamethasone treatment. The main risk factors for HSV and CMV in the studied cohorts were the length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we recommend routine monitoring of critically ill COVID-19 patients for these viral co-infections and consider treatment in those patients.","output":"Risk factors for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in critically-ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The intrusion of the Covid-19 in Quebec witnesses the failure of seniors' residences to adequately protect their residents.

The proportion of cases locally acquired has dropped substantially to 28% of new cases this period compared with 50% and greater observed since 30 March 2020. Of the cases considered to be locally-acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years.

We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. RESULTS: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings.

By selecting fusion-positive viruses at the nonpermissive temperature, we isolated several recombinants containing multiple crossovers in a single genome. Some of the recombinants became fusion negative during the plaque purification. The fusion ability of the recombinants parallels the presence or absence of the A59 genomic sequences encoding peplomers. Several of the recombinants have crossovers within 3' end genes which encode viral structural proteins, N and E1. These recombination sites were not specifically selected with the selection markers used. This finding, together with results of previous recombination studies, indicates that RNA recombination can occur almost anywhere from the 5' end to the 3' end along the entire genome. The data also show that the replacement of A59 genetic sequences at the 5' end of gene C, which encodes the peplomer protein, with the fusion-negative MHV-2 sequences do not affect the fusion ability of the recombinant viruses.

This mode of delivery allowed two students per donor station to spend one hour per week in the anatomy laboratory with all digital learning elements transferred to the virtual learning platform Blackboard as pre- and post-practical session learning activities.

This article examines these protein-sector supply-chain shocks, exploring the nature and causes of the market disruptions during the pandemic, evaluating the effects of these shocks from an economic perspective, and discussing potential market and policy responses that could mitigate the adverse effects of similar events in the future. Sources A variety of sources contemporary to the pandemic were surveyed to document pandemic effects on meat and poultry supply chains. The implications of pandemic effects for supply chain participants were explored, drawing from sources in supply chain management, network reliability, and agricultural economics literature. Synthesis Pandemic-related disruptions to meat supply chains and the economic hardship associated with those disruptions have generated tremendous interest in improving supply chain robustness and resilience. Much of that interest focuses on encouraging local and regional processing operations, creating shorter supply chains. At the same time, commercial interests will most likely aggressively pursue further automation to mitigate the effects of labor supply disruptiontheir major problem during the pandemic. Conclusions and Applications Local and regional processing operations are receiving a significant infusion of pandemic relief funds. Consumers are currently keenly interested in local and regional food options. At the same time, commercial operations will likely become even more efficient due to postpandemic adjustments. Thus, local and regional operations may face an even more challenging competitive environment than before the pandemic.","output":"Invited Review: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic for food supply chains* * Presented as part of the ARPAS Symposium: Building a Resilient Food Production System in the US: What COVID-19 and Other Black Swan Events Have Exposed About Modern Food Production, July 2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cholesterol homeostasis is related to multiple diseases in humans, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative and hepatic diseases.

Influenza A virus (IAV) causes seasonal epidemics and sporadic, but dangerous pandemics. A rapid antigen changes and recombination of the viral RNA genome contribute to the reduced effectiveness of vaccination and anti-influenza drugs. Hence, there is a necessity to develop new antiviral drugs and strategies to limit the influenza spread. IAV is a single-stranded negative sense RNA virus with a genome (viral RNAvRNA) consisting of eight segments. Segments within influenza virion are assembled into viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes that are independent transcription-replication units. Each step in the influenza life cycle is regulated by the RNA and is dependent on its interplay and dynamics. Therefore, viral RNA can be a proper target to design novel therapeutics. Here, we briefly described examples of anti-influenza strategies based on the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and catalytic nucleic acids. In particular we focused on the vRNA structure-function relationship as well as presented the advantages of using secondary structure information in predicting therapeutic targets and the potential future of this field.","output":"RNA Secondary Structure as a First Step for Rational Design of the Oligonucleotides towards Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive brain recordings using many electrodes across a wide range of tasks provide a unique opportunity to study the role of oscillatory patterning and functional connectivity. We used large-scale recordings (stereo EEG) within and beyond the human hippocampus to investigate the role of distinct frequency oscillations during real-time execution of visual, attention and memory tasks in eight epileptic patients. We found that activity patterns in the hippocampus showed task and frequency dependent properties. Importantly, we found distinct connectivity signatures, in particular concerning parietal-hippocampal connectivity, thus revealing large scale synchronization of networks involved in memory tasks. Comparing the power per frequency band, across tasks and hippocampal regions (anterior/posterior) we confirmed a main effect of frequency band (p = 0.002). Gamma band activity was higher for visuo-spatial memory tasks in the anterior hippocampus. Further, we found that alpha and beta band activity in posterior hippocampus had larger modulation for high memory load visual tasks (p = 0.004). Three functional connectivity task related networks were identified: (dorsal) parietal-hippocampus (visual attention and memory), ventral stream- hippocampus and hippocampal-frontal connections (mainly tasks involving face recognition or object based search). These findings support the critical role of oscillatory patterning in the hippocampus during visual and memory tasks and suggests the presence of task related spectral and functional connectivity signatures. These results show that the use of large scale human intracranial recordings can validate the role of oscillatory and functional connectivity patterns across a broad range of cognitive domains.","output":"Intracranial recordings in humans reveal specific hippocampal spectral and dorsal vs. ventral connectivity signatures during visual, attention and memory tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. 2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. 3.

After castration, the wound area on the antebrachium was clipped, copiously lavaged and the wound edges were surgically debrided. Injectable antibiotics and analgesic management were instituted. The wound was conservatively managed using sugar bandaging and antibiotic dressings until the progression of healing plateaued. Procedures for closing the defect were explored, and it was decided that a single-pedicle hinge flap would be ideal. The procedure was performed on the mobile veterinary unit and managed postoperatively with pain control and biweekly bandage changes. After 3 weeks, the single-pedicle hinge flap was released to create a skin graft, which successfully filled the defect.

Understanding the respiratory immune microenvironment which is composed of multiple cell types, together with cell communication based on ligandCreceptor interactions is important for developing vaccines, probing COVID-19 pathogenesis, and improving pandemic control measures. METHODS: A total of 102 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Clinical information, routine laboratory tests, and flow cytometry analysis data with different conditions were collected and assessed for predictive value in COVID-19 patients. Next, we analyzed public single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which offers the closest available view of immune cell heterogeneity as encountered in patients with varying severity of COVID-19. A weighting algorithm was used to calculate ligandCreceptor interactions, revealing the communication potentially associated with outcomes across cell types. Finally, serum cytokines including IL6, IL1, IL10, CXCL10, TNF, GALECTIN-1, and IGF1 derived from patients were measured. RESULTS: Of the 102 COVID-19 patients, 42 cases (41.2%) were categorized as severe. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that AST, D-dimer, BUN, and WBC were considered as independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. T cell numbers including total T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the severe disease group were significantly lower than those in the moderate disease group. The risk model containing the above mentioned inflammatory damage parameters, and the counts of T cells, with AUROCs ranged from 0.78 to 0.87. To investigate the molecular mechanism at the cellular level, we analyzed the published scRNA-seq data and found that macrophages displayed specific functional diversity after SARS-Cov-2 infection, and the metabolic pathway activities in the identified macrophage subtypes were influenced by hypoxia status. Importantly, we described ligandCreceptor interactions that are related to COVID-19 serverity involving macrophages and T cell subsets by communication analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that macrophages driving ligandCreceptor crosstalk contributed to the reduction and exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells. The identified crucial cytokine panel, including IL6, IL1, IL10, CXCL10, IGF1, and GALECTIN-1, may offer the selective targets to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 therapy.

We reevaluated preoperative thin-section computed tomography (TSCT) to determine solid size and pathological invasive size using the fourth edition of the WHO classification and reclassified them according to the new TNM classification. The discriminative power of survival curves by the seventh edition was compared with that by the eighth edition by using concordance probability estimates and Akaike's information criteria calculated using a univariable Cox regression model. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to elucidate the correlation between radiological solid size using TSCT and pathological invasive size. RESULTS The overall survival curves in the eighth edition were well distinct at each clinical and pathological stage. The 5-year survival rates of patients with clinical and pathological stage 0 newly defined were both 100%. The concordance probability estimate and Akaike's information criterion values of the eighth edition were higher than those of the seventh edition in discriminatory power for overall survival. Solid size on TSCT scan and pathological invasive size showed a positive linear relationship, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated as 0.83, which indicated strong correlation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to reliably evaluate the prevalence and mortality of dialysis patients in Germany with respect to COVID-19, during the first wave in spring 2020 the German Society of Nephrology implemented a registry for dialysis patients. Weekly data on the number and course of dialysis patients affected by COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of COVID-19 in dialysis patients in Germany developed in two waves, similar to the course of the pandemic in the general population. In spring the prevalence in dialysis patients reached 1.4% and considerably declined during the summer. In December during the second wave of the pandemic the prevalence again rose to 1.9%, despite comprehensively implemented hygiene measures in dialysis centers. Similar to other industrial nations, dialysis patients in Germany also showed a very high lethality of COVID-19 of up to 20%. CONCLUSION: Immediate consequences for hygiene measures in dialysis institutions as well as vaccination strategies and vaccination prioritization for this patient group and the personnel treating them can be derived from the high mortality in dialysis patients.

Multivariate logistic regression models were used to report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19. RESULTS: The cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34C11.80, p < 0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62C16.02, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with South Asians ethnicity are more likely to have worse prognosis and outcome when compared to patients with Arab ethnicity.

Metabolic selection marker technologies (e.g. glutamine synthetase (GS) or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)) are routinely employed to generate such recombinant mammalian cell lines. Here we describe the development of a selection marker system based on the metabolic requirement of CHO cells to produce proline, and that uses pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthetase (P5CS) to complement this auxotrophy. Firstly, we showed the system can be used to generate cells that have growth kinetics in proline-free medium similar to those of the parent CHO cell line, CHOK1SV GS-KO? grown in proline-containing medium. As we have previously described how engineering lipid metabolism can be harnessed to enhance recombinant protein productivity in CHO cells, we then used the P5CS selection system to re-engineer lipid metabolism by over-expression of either sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBF1) or stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). The cells with re-engineered proline and lipid metabolism showed consistent growth and P5CS, SCD1 and SREBF1 expression across 100 cell generations. Finally, we show that the P5CS and GS selection systems can be used together. A GS vector containing the light and heavy chains for a mAb was super-transfected into a CHOK1SV GS-KO? host over-expressing SCD1 from a P5CS vector. The resulting stable transfectant pools achieved a higher concentration at harvest for a model difficult to express mAb than the CHOK1SV GS-KO? host. This demonstrates that the P5CS and GS selection systems can be used concomitantly to enable CHO cell line genetic engineering and recombinant protein expression.","output":"A proline metabolism selection system and its application to the engineering of lipid biosynthesis in Chinese hamster ovary cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the demographic and diagnostic distribution of patients presenting to the ophthalmology department during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period METHODS: The study included patients who made outpatient appointments in our ophthalmology department. The COVID-19 group (CovG) comprised patients who presented between April 15 and May 15, 2020, the 30-day period with the highest daily number of new cases in Turkey. The control group (CG) was obtained by randomization through a computer program from among 2 245 patients who applied in the same period of the previous year. The patients' presenting complaint(s), diagnostic(s) and demographic information's were collected from a database, with all identifying information concealed. For patients who presented more than once, their initial complaint and diagnoses were analyzed RESULTS: The study included a total of 400 patients: 200 in the CovG and 200 in the CG. Mean ages in the CovG and CG were 41.23  14.48 and 48.20  17.49 years, respectively (p < 0.001). The female to male patient ratio was 0.53 in the CovG and 0.83 in the CG (p = 0.032). There were fewer university graduates compared to other education levels among the patients who presented during the pandemic (p = 0.013). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no increase in presentation frequency for any ocular disease compared to the previous year. The only statistical decrease in patient application complaints was observed in reading difficultness (11 % in CovG vs. 37 % in CG; p < 0.001). Presentations due to dry eye (DE) and allergic conjunctivitis (AC) were similar to the same period of the year (p = 0.303 and p = 0.550, respectively). At least 1 chronic ocular disease was present in 25 % of the CovG and 45.5 % of the CG (p < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease was observed in CovG for age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma in the diagnoses made at the end of the examination (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, the most common outpatient presentations to the ophthalmology department were for the diagnoses of DE and AC. During peak pandemic period, elderly patients, women and academically trained patients significantly reduced their visits to the Eye Clinic. The reduction in presentation of patients with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration may be due to the longterm treatment planning for these patients and the social isolation measures issued for the older population. These patients should be encouraged to use video consultation / telemedicine in eye patients at risk of vision loss.","output":"Evaluation of Patients Presenting to the Ophthalmology Department of a Tertiary Hospital for Nonemergency Reasons During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely impacted the globally interconnected economy and brought the tourism sector to a temporary standstill. As such, this study aimed to investigate the spillover effect of industrial sectors by emphasizing the tourism sector. The study data was gathered from China and The United States (US) between 2019 and 2020 (pandemic period) using the Multivariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic-Dynamic Conditional Correlation (MGARCH-DCC) and Wavelet Coherence Transform (CWT) techniques to analyse the investment holding period. Country-wise, the sectoral return volatility in China was significantly higher than the US counterpart. Additionally, the intra-sector correlation analyses demonstrated that Chinese sectors successfully mitigated the intra-sector correction in the last quarter of 2019. A short-term holding period was also suggested for investors in China while a long-term counterpart was recommended for investors in the US. Regarding the Chinese and US industrial sectors in the first quarter of 2020, it was mutually concluded that both country stocks reflected high volatility.

COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs. OBJECTIVES: to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown. DESIGN: cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19. RESULTS: 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.","output":"Ethics committees in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, a number of phenomenological approaches to experiential justification emerged according to which an experience's justificatory force is grounded in the experiences distinctive phenomenology.

Despite evidence suggesting that SNAs would emerge as an innate predisposition to map numerical information onto a left-to-right spatially oriented mental representation, alternative accounts have challenged these proposals, maintaining that such a mapping would be the result of a mere spatial frequency (SF) coding of any visual image. That is, any smaller or larger array of objects would naturally contain more low or high SF information and, accordingly, each hemisphere would be preferentially tuned only for one SF range (e.g., right hemisphere tuned for low SF and left hemisphere tuned for high SF). This would determine the typical SNA (e.g., faster RTs for small numerical arrays with the left hand and for large numerical arrays with the right hand). To directly probe the role of SF coding in SNAs, we tested participants in a typical dot-arrays comparison task with two numerical sets: one in which SFs were confounded with numerosity (Experiment 1) and one in which the full SF power spectrum was equalized across all stimuli, keeping this cue uninformative about numerosity (Experiment 2). We found that SNAs emerged in both experiments, independently of whether SF was confounded or not with numerosity. Taken together, these findings suggest that SNAs cannot simply originate from SF power spectrum alone, and, thus, they rule out the brains asymmetric SF tuning as a primary cause of such an effect.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The identification and quantification of compounds responsible for antiplasmodial activity in different parts (leaf, stem and root) of C. pareira is the target of current study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hydro ethanolic parent extracts of different parts of C. pareira, fractions prepared from these extracts were evaluated against Pf3D7 (chloroquine sensitive) and PfINDO (chloroquine resistance) strains in culture to quantify the IC50 for extracts and fractions. Promising fractions of root part of plant were subjected to silica gel column chromatography to obtain pure compounds and their structures were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis. Pure compounds were also tested against Pf3D7 and PfINDO strains. A rapid and simple UPLC-DAD method was developed for the identification and quantification of pharmaceutically important metabolites of C. pareira. RESULTS: Among different extracts, the hydro ethanolic extract of root part of C. pareira was found most active with IC50 values (g/ml) of 1.42 and 1.15 against Pf 3D7 and Pf INDO, respectively. Tested against Pf 3D7 the most potent fractions were root ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 4.0 g/ml), stem water fraction (IC50 4.4 g/ml), and root water fraction (IC50 8.5 g/ml). Further, phytochemical investigation of active fractions of root part led to the isolation and characterization of a new isoquinoline alkaloid, namely pareirarine (8), along with five known compounds magnoflorine (5), magnocurarine (10), saluateridine (11), cissamine (13) and hayatinine (15). Hayatinine (15), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, isolated from root ethyl acetate fraction was most promising compound with IC50 of 0.41 M (Pf INDO) and 0.509 M (Pf 3D7). Magnocurarine (10) and cissamine (13) were also found active with IC50 values of 12.51 and 47.34 M against Pf INDO and 12.54 and 8.76 M against Pf 3D7, respectively. A total of thirty compounds were detected in studied extracts and fractions, structures were assigned to 15 of these and five of these biologically important compounds were quantified. Isolation of saluteridine (11) from C. pareira and the evaluation of antiplasmodial activity of pure compound from C. pariera is disclosed for the first time.

We describe the rationale and methods of the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Registry (INSPIRE) that combines patient-reported outcomes with data from digital health records to understand predictors and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODSINSPIRE is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of individuals with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in eight regions across the US. Included are adults fluent in English or Spanish, with self-reported symptoms suggestive of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, enrolled within 42 days of having a US Food and Drug Administration approved SARS-CoV-2 viral test (i.e., nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test). Recruitment occurs in-person, by phone or email, and through online advertisement. A secure online platform is used to facilitate the collation of consent-related materials, digital health records, and responses to self-administered surveys. Participants will be followed for up to 18 months, with patient-reported outcomes collected every three months via survey and linked to concurrent digital health data; follow-up includes no in-person involvement. Our maximum expected enrollment is 4,800 participants, including 3,600 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 1,200 SARS-CoV-2 negative participants (as a concurrent comparison group). These data will allow assessment of longitudinal outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison of the relative risk of outcomes in individuals with and without infection. Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health function and status, as well as clinical outcomes including health system encounters and new diagnoses.

Hence, intensive one-to-one therapist-patient training is still required. We have developed a novel rehabilitation prototype, specifically aimed at providing sitting balance therapy. We investigated whether technology-supported sitting balance training was feasible and safe in chronic stroke patients and we determined whether clinical outcomes improved after a four-week programme, compared with usual care. METHODS: In this parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled pilot trial, we divided first-event chronic stroke participants into two groups. The experimental group received usual care plus additional therapy supported by rehabilitation technology, consisting of 12 sessions of 50 min of therapy over four weeks. The control group received usual care only. We assessed all participants twice pre-intervention and once post-intervention. Feasibility and safety were descriptively analysed. Between-group analysis evaluated the pre-to-post differences in changes in motor and functional outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 30 participants were recruited and 29 completed the trial (experimental group: n = 14; control group: n = 15). There were no between-group differences at baseline. Therapy was evaluated as feasible by participants and therapist. There were no serious adverse events during sitting balance therapy. Changes in clinical outcomes from pre- to post-intervention demonstrated increases in the experimental than in the control group for: sitting balance and trunk function, evaluated by the Trunk Impairment Scale (mean points score (SD) 7.07 (1.69) versus 0.33 (2.35); p < 0.000); maximum gait speed, assessed with the 10 Metre Walk Test (mean gait speed 0.16 (0.16) m/s versus 0.06 (0.06) m/s; p = 0.003); and functional balance, measured using the Berg balance scale (median points score (IQR) 4.5 (5) versus 0 (4); p = 0.014).

On March 29, 2020, a staff member in a correctional and detention facility in Louisiana developed symptoms? and later had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. During April 2-May 7, two additional cases were detected among staff members, and 36 cases were detected among incarcerated and detained persons at the facility; these persons were removed from dormitories and isolated, and the five dormitories that they had resided in before diagnosis were quarantined. On May 7, CDC and the Louisiana Department of Health initiated an investigation to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incarcerated and detained persons residing in quarantined dormitories. Goals of this investigation included evaluating COVID-19 symptoms in this setting and assessing the effectiveness of serial testing to identify additional persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of efforts to mitigate transmission.

The presence of inclusive healthcare practices predicted comfort for LGBTQ+ patients (P < 0.10). Additionally, OHPs who either identified as an ally or as having a family member or close friend in the LGBTQ+ community had higher odds of feeling responsible to treat LGBTQ+ patients. CONCLUSION: Many LGBTQ+ patients often experience discomfort in oral healthcare settings. While OHPs were largely unaware of this, evidence suggests the need for cultural competency training for OHPs.","output":"Reviewing challenges in access to oral health services among the LGBTQ+ community in Indiana and Michigan: A cross-sectional, exploratory study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events relating to the Covid-19 Pandemic have increased the interest in modelling the spread of disease.

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank. SETTING: The study involved 1355 participants from 11 governorates, including 112 localities in the West Bank and 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank, in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine check-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated as the proportion of individuals who had a positive result in the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the immunoassay. RESULTS: The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% and an adjusted CI (0% to 0.0043%), while the lab referral samples yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% and an adjusted CI (0.001325% to 0.011566%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that as of mid-June 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persists low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasising the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control.

We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to understand the role of outreach teams in delivering TB household contact tracing. METHODS: The study took place in three districts of South Africa between May 2016 and February 2017. We conducted 78 in-depth interviews (IDI) (comprising 35 key stakeholders, 31 TB index patients and 12 HHCs) and five focus group discussions (FGD) (40 outreach team members in four FGDs and 12 community stakeholders in one FGD). RESULTS: Outreach teams contributed positively by working across health-related programmes, providing home-based care and assisting with tracing of persons lost to TB care. However, outreach teams had a limited focus on TB household contact tracing activities, likely due to the broad scope of their work and insufficient programmatic support. Outreach teams often confused TB household contact tracing activities with finding persons lost to TB care. The community also had some reservations on the role of outreach teams conducting TB household contact tracing activities. CONCLUSIONS: Creating awareness among outreach workers and clinic personnel about the importance of and activities related to TB household contact tracing would be required to strengthen the delivery of TB household contact tracing through the community-based primary health care teams. We need better monitoring and evaluation systems, stronger integration within a realistic scope of work, adequate training on TB household contact tracing and TB infection prevention control measures.

The algorithm first performs an exhaustive search through a discrete set of widely dispersed solutions which are representative of large subregions of the search space;then, it uses the search results to initialize a Monte Carlo process that searches quasi-randomly for a best solution;then, it finally uses a Newton-type iteration to converge to a solution that satisfies mathematical conditions of local optimality. We demonstrate our methodology on an epidemiological model of the coronavirus disease with testing and distancing controls applied over a period of 180 days to two different subpopulations (low-risk and high-risk), where model parameters are chosen to fit the city of Houston, Texas, USA. In order to enable the user to select his/her preferred trade-off between (number of deaths) and (herd immunity) outcomes, the objective function includes costs for deaths and non-immunity. Optimal strategies are estimated for a grid of (death cost)  (non-immunity cost) combinations, in order to obtain a Pareto curve that represents optimum trade-offs. The levels of the four controls for the different Pareto-optimal solutions over the 180-day period are visually represented and their characteristics discussed. Three different variants of the algorithm are run in order to determine the relative importance of the three stages in the optimization. Results from the three algorithm variants are fairly consistent, indicating that solutions are robust. Results also show that the Monte Carlo stage plays an especially prominent role in the optimization, but that all three stages of the process make significant contributions towards finding lower-cost, more effective control strategies.","output":"Three-Stage Numerical Solution for Optimal Control of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rigid polyurethane foams were obtained using two types of renewable raw materials: bio-polyols and a cellulose filler (ARBOCEL(?)

In the European Union (EU), the rule of law is enshrined in the Treaties of its founding and is recognised not just as a necessary condition of a liberal democratic society, but also as an important requirement for a stable, effective, and sustainable market economy. In fact, it was the stability and equality of opportunity provided by the rule of law that enabled the post-war Wirtschaftswunder in Germany and the post-Communist resuscitation of the economy in Poland.But the rule of law is a living concept that is constantly evolving C both in its formal, de jure dimension, embodied in legislation, and its de facto dimension, or its reception by society. In Poland, in particular, according to the EU, the rule of law has been heavily challenged by government since 2015 and has evolved amid continued pressure exerted on the institutions which execute laws. More recently, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic transformed the perception of the rule of law and its boundaries throughout the EU and beyond (Marzocchi, 2020).Against this background, this study examines the rule of law as a determinant of economic development in Germany and Poland from both the de jure and de facto perspectives, in line with the following research questions:Research question 1: What formal institutions constitute the rule of law to the extent relevant to economic development in the countries under analysis C in other words, what is the state de jure of the rule of law?Research question 2: What is the social reception of those institutions to the extent relevant to economic development C in other words, what is the state de facto of the rule of law?Research question 3: How does the state de facto of the rule of law impact economic development in the countries under analysis?The problem that we undertake to research is multifaceted and highly complex. We address the former challenge with a multidisciplinary approach. Taking rules, or norms, as the leading theme of the project and the common denominator of its respective parts, the study bridges two research fields, new institutional economics and sociology of law, contributing to both of them. We believe that by confronting legal norms with social norms C which are often overlooked by legislators C and by grounding our econometric analysis in solid sociological considerations C which are usually disregarded or relegated to assumptions by economists C we will capture synergies that have so far been missing in academic literature.Defining the rule of law. The rule of law is a subtle and evolving concept, and any attempt to define it would merit a separate study. In theoretical legal literature, a differentiation is usually drawn between the formal and the substantive approaches to the rule of law (e.g. Krygier, 2015;Waldron, 2016). In the formal approach, which is usually associated with the Anglo-Saxon conception, the rule of law consists in the rightful procedures C such as separation and balance of powers, timely and orderly publication of laws, and the functioning of an independent judiciary. In the substantive approach, more akin to the German Rechtsstaat, substantive elements such as rights and freedoms deemed inalienable C in the economic context, inter alia, property rights, economic freedom, and freedom from corruption C also become integral components of the rule of law.In parallel, economists have transcended the boundaries of their science, proposing several candidates for extra-economic causes of economic growth. New institutional economics, in particular, focuses on studying the rule of law as one of the core institutions determining economic growth. According to this stream of research, institutions may be contract?enabling and stimulate economic growth if they decrease transaction costs (i.e. the costs related to the identification of a suitable ransaction, the negotiation of a contract with the transaction partner, and the enforcement of the contract) and increase inclusiveness (i.e. the degree to which diverse parties can participate in a transaction, thus contributing to the societal pool by way of skills and effort). In contrast, institutions are contract-disabling if they increase transaction costs and create clubs with special privileges.Because our study has direct economic relevance and is based on existing literature in the field of institutional economics (e.g. Acemo?lu et al., 2005a), we distinguish and account for those emanations of the rule of law that satisfy one or both of the above-mentioned criteria, namely: separation and balance of powers;the independent judiciary;legal certainty;economic freedom;property rights;anti-corruption regulations;free media;items of general relevance (e.g. non?discrimination, state liability).Clear, certain, and predictable regulations permit economic actors to plan their actions, allowing them to efficiently manage their resources. Property rights secure ownership of assets, driving down the costs of securing them by private means. In particular, intellectual property rights, by allowing companies to recoup investment and reap returns, play a crucial role in driving innovation. As such, they are particularly important to innovation-based economies (such as Germany) and economies facing a transition to the innovation-based model (such as Poland). Economic freedom ensures equality of opportunity, allowing everyone to contribute to the common pool. Fortified by anti-corruption mechanisms, economic freedom ensures the optimal allocation of resources, as seen for instance in merit-based employment and competition-based project financing (in contrast to arbitrary allocations, such as by nepotism or cronyism). The checks and balances built into the political system keep it from being hijacked by certain interests and are strengthened by the public scrutiny routinely performed by free media. Acting as a referee, the independent judiciary provides insurance to companies and households through which contracts are enforced (e.g. default), the decisions of state authorities are reviewed (e.g. in tax disputes), and the unfair practices of other market participants (e.g. unfair competition) are screened out.","output":"The Rule of Law and its Social Reception as Determinants of Economic Development.

The upcoming question is how the interplay between vaccinations and social measures will shape infections and hospitalizations. Hence, we extend the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including these elements. We calibrate it to data of Luxembourg, Austria and Sweden until 15th December 2020. Sweden results having the highest fraction of undetected, Luxembourg of infected and all three being far from herd immunity in December. We quantify the level of social interaction, showing that a level around 1/3 of before the pandemic was still required in December to keep the effective reproduction number R eff t below 1, for all three countries. Aiming to vaccinate the whole population within 1 year at constant rate would require on average 1,700 fully vaccinated people/day in Luxembourg, 24,000 in Austria and 28,000 in Sweden, and could lead to herd immunity only by mid summer. Herd immunity might not be reached in 2021 if too slow vaccines rollout speeds are employed. The model thus estimates which vaccination rates are too low to allow reaching herd immunity in 2021, depending on social interaction. Vaccination will considerably, but not immediately, help to curb the infection; thus limiting social interactions remains crucial for the months to come.","output":"Modelling COVID-19 dynamics and potential for herd immunity by vaccination in Austria, Luxembourg and Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A semi-empirical model, based on the logistic map approach, was developed and applied to forecast the different phases of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. This model can be used to make predictions of the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in different spatial scales: from a world scale to a country or even a smaller scale. Predictions on persons hospitalized, number of ventilators needed at ICUs and potential numbers of deaths were successfully carried out in different countries using this approach. This paper shows the mathematical basis for the model together with a proposal for its calibration on the different phases of the epidemic. Specific results are shown for the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. For predicting the evolution of the epidemic four phases were considered: non-controlled evolution since the 20th of February; total lock-down from the 15th of March; partial easing of the lock-down from the 13th of April; and a phased lock-down easing from the 1st of May. In a first phase, if no control is established, the model predicted in Spain 12 millions of infected people of a total of 46.6 millions inhabitants. From those infected nearly 1 million people would need intensive care and around 700,000 deaths would be directly produced by the disease. However, as these numbers would occur in a brief period (few months), the number of deaths would have been higher due to the saturation of the health system. For a second phase, considering a total lock-down of the whole country from the 15th of March, the model predicted for the 17th of April 194,000 symptomatic infected cases, 85,700 hospitalized, nearly 8,600 patients with needs of an ICU and 19,500 deaths. The model also predicted the peak to be produced between the 29th of March and the 3rd of April. Although the data are still under revision, the accuracy in all the predictions was very good, as the reported values by that day were 197,142 infected, 7,548 inpatients needing an ICU and 20,043 deaths. The peak was produced between the 31st of May and the 2nd of April. For the third phase, the ease of the lock-down which began the 13th of April, early predictions were made by the beginning of April [Mora2020c]. Assuming conservatively an infection daily rate of a 3% (r=1.03) the model predicted 400,000 infections and 46,000+/-15,000 deaths by the end of May. The predictions overestimated the real values, due to a stricter reduction of the infection daily rate which lead to values of r<1% and a revision of the whole series of data by the health authorities carried out along the month of May. A new prediction performed with updated parameters at the beginning of May provided a prediction of 250,000 infected and 29,000+/-15,000 deaths. The reported values by the end of May were 282,870 infected and 28,552 deaths. After the total easing of the lock-down many uncertainties appear, but the model predicts that the health system would not saturate if the daily rate of infections r is kept below 1.02 (2% of daily increase in the number of symptomatic infected). This simple model provides a system to predict the evolution of epidemics with a good accuracy, even during epidemics development, where other systems have difficulties in their calibration. As the parameters involved in the model are based in empirical values of the different quantities (e.g. number of inpatients or deaths, related with the number of infected persons) it can be dynamically adjusted and adapted to sudden changes in the statistics. As other models, the results provided by this model can be used by the authorities to support decision making in order to optimize resources and to minimize the consequences of epidemics, including the future outbreaks of the COVID-19 which will occur.","output":"A Semiempirical Dynamical Model to Forecast the Propagation of Epidemics: The Case of the Sars-Cov-2 in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Brain vulnerability in the critically ill preterm newborn may be related to the burden of cerebral hypoxygenation and hypoperfusion during the immediate postnatal period.

METHODS We studied a prospective cohort of 60 VLBW infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit within the first 6 h of life between March 2010 and June 2012. rSO2 (expressed as a number of summary measures) was continuously monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100 Somanetic) during the first 48 h of life, SCVf was measured at 4-6, 12, 24 and 48 h after birth, and CFOE was calculated. RESULTS The mean gestational age was 27.9 (SD 2.39); 8 infants died (13.3%) and 7 developed IVH grade III-IV: 1 in the alive group and 6 in the deceased group (p < 0.001). The odds ratio for death was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.015-1.15, p = 0.016) for each 10 periods of rSO2 values <40% in the first 48 h, and 4.2 (95% CI: 1.27-14.05, p = 0.019) for SVCf values <40 ml/kg/min.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients who were admitted to our hospital with the suspicion of COVID-19 between 1 April 2020 and 30 April 2020 and tested negative after RT-PCR test, and underwent CT for further diagnosis. Initial CT findings were classified as typical, indeterminate, and atypical for COVID-19, and negative for pneumonia. Incidental findings on CT were noted. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with a mean age of 57 years (min 18 years-max 96 years), 168 (49.70%) were male and 170 (50.29%) were female. The most common symptoms were cough (58.87%), fever (40.82%), and dyspnea (39.34%). The CT findings were typical for COVID-19 in 109 (32.24%) patients, indeterminate in 47 (13.90%) patients, and atypical in 77 (22.78%) patients. The CT findings of 105 (31.06%) patients were negative for pneumonia. Incidental lung nodules suspicious of malignancy were identified in seven patients. Seventy-seven patients (22.78%) had extrapulmonary incidental findings CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of CT in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19 is not very high. Based on clinical, laboratory, and chest x-ray findings, it may be more appropriate to refer patients to CT after the first triage, when necessary.","output":"Should CT be used for the diagnosis of RT-PCR-negative suspected COVID-19 patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities have been asking for social distancing to prevent transmission of the virus. However, enforcing such distancing has been challenging in tight spaces such as elevators and unmonitored commercial settings such as offices. This article addresses this gap by proposing a low-cost and non-intrusive method for monitoring social distancing within a given space, using Channel State Information (CSI) from passive WiFi sensing. By exploiting the frequency selective behavior of CSI with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, we achieve an improvement in accuracy over existing crowd counting works. Our system counts the number of occupants with a 93% accuracy rate in an elevator setting and predicts whether the COVID-Safe limit is breached with a 97% accuracy rate. We also demonstrate the occupant counting capability of the system in a commercial office setting, achieving 97% accuracy. Our proposed occupancy monitoring outperforms existing methods by at least 7%. Overall, the proposed framework is inexpensive, requiring only one device that passively collects data and a lightweight supervised learning algorithm for prediction. Our lightweight model and accuracy improvements are necessary contributions for WiFi-based counting to be suitable for COVID-specific applications.(1)","output":"COVID-Safe Spatial Occupancy Monitoring Using OFDM-Based Features and Passive WiFi Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A model of COVID-19 in an interconnected network of communities is studied This model considers the dynamics of susceptible, asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, deceased but not yet buried people, as well as the dynamics of the virus or pathogen at connected nodes or communities People can move between communities carrying the virus to any node in the region of n communities (or patches) This model considers both virus direct (person to person) and indirect (contaminated environment to person) transmissions Using either matrix and graph-theoretic methods and some combinatorial identities, appropriate Lyapunov functions are constructed to study global stability properties of both the disease-free and the endemic equilibrium of the corresponding system of 5n differential equations","output":"On a Model of Covid-19 Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The The Neonatal Nurse Practitioner program at The Ohio State University transitioned from a traditional face-to-face program to a distance-enhanced hybrid model providing course content online with campus visits for procedural skills and simulation in 2017. Although the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic necessitated cancellation of all in-person events across the university, the neonatal nurse practitioner students' learning needs remained the same. METHOD: The onsite experience was redesigned for virtual delivery. Procedural content was accomplished through student-led small-group collaborative critical thinking activities surrounding procedural complications, and other faculty-led scenario discussions. RESULTS: Students collaborated for a Complications Rounds activity (1-day) that promoted learning about procedural skills from a global perspective including safe techniques, monitoring, risks, and troubleshooting complications. CONCLUSION: Procedural content can be achieved when in-person learning is not possible. The Complications Rounds approach can mitigate delays or gaps in practical experiences. Examining complications in-depth increases preparedness, promoting greater awareness of harm prevention when these present in future practice.

Consequently, older people and patients present with multi-morbidities and more complex needs, putting significant pressure on healthcare systems. Effective nutrition interventions could be an important tool to address patient needs, improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Inflammation plays a central role in NCDs, so targeting it is relevant to disease prevention and treatment.

An expert group reviewed the data on omega-3 LCPUFAs in specific patient populations and medical conditions. Evidence for benefits in cognitive health, age- and disease-related decline in muscle mass, cancer treatment, surgical patients and critical illness was identified. Use of DHA and EPA in some conditions is already included in some relevant guidelines. However, it is important to note that data on the effects of omega-3 LCPUFAs are still inconsistent in many areas (e.g., cognitive decline) due to a range of factors that vary amongst the trials performed to date; these factors include dose, timing and duration; baseline omega-3 LCPUFA status; and intake of other nutrients.

This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS Totally, 240 patients (aged 65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53  64.33 mL) and group G (308.03  64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40  120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P < 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99  30.36 mL) and group G (124.09  24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31  48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P < 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 [0, 100.00]) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P < 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P < 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P < 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P < 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P < 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41  1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83  1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55  3.10 min, F = 352.50, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77/80) was significantly higher than group C (66/80,  = 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69/80,  = 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10/80) was significantly higher than group T (3/80,  = 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2/80,  = 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, all within clinical range. Injectate included 3H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results are given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult but was not dose-dependent; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/Kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and 3H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain.

A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i. VP27 and domain 4 in ORF1a) more than at domains dedicated to intrinsic virus functions (f.i. VP34 and ORF1b (the virus polymerase)).

The COVID19 disease, being novel in nature along with high infectivity and frequent mutational rate, has been termed to be fatal across the globe. The advent of infection by SARS-CoV-2 has brought a myriad of secondary complications and comorbidities resulting in additional challenges to the health care system induced by novel therapeutic procedures. The emerging variant with respect to the Indian subcontinent and the associated genetic mutations have worsened the situation at hand. Proper clinical management along with epidemiological studies and clinical presentations in scientific studies and trials is necessary in order to combat the simultaneous waves of emerging strains.

At the same time an elevated level of suPAR has been independently associated with incident chronic kidney disease. We investigated the association between admission suPAR levels and severity and outcome of Hemodialysis (HD) patients with Covid-19 infection. METHOD: In an observational study of adult HD patients hospitalized for Covid-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples. The time table for those measurements were as follows: at the beginning of admission, after hemoperfusion (HP) session for those patients that received them, and just before discharge. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients (7 were male), 13 patients received HP (mean age: 74 years old). The median suPAR level was 12.94 ng/ml. For those who undertook HP median suPAR level was 10.55 ng/ml at the end of each session (p=NS). 3 patients had suPAR level below 7 ng/ml. 2 of them survived without developing pleural effusions. 7 patients discharged from the hospital with median suPAR level 12.94 ng/ml which did not differ significantly from the median suPAR level of the diceased ones (13.68 ng/ml). CONCLUSION: Admission of suPAR levels in HD patients hospitalized for Covid-19 do not seem to be predictive for their clinical course in general. Chronic Kidney Disease backround and its relation to suPAR levels independently of patients inflammation status may be the key component for our notice.

Symptoms of medical procedure and generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and depression may emerge, despite the successful restoration of organ function. METHODS We examined symptoms of anxiety, depression, trauma, and medical procedure anxiety-specifically, fear and avoidance of needles-in youth who had received a kidney, liver, or heart transplant. Parent-report on child mental health symptoms was also collected. RESULTS Data were obtained for 56 youth. Most children did not endorse clinically significant symptoms of depression. In contrast, 20% of parents reported symptoms of depression in their child that exceeded clinical cutoffs. Parents also reported higher levels of anxiety in their children than did the children themselves. Indeed, on average, children reported lower levels of depression and anxiety than would be expected in a general population. On a trauma measure, 22.6% of youths' scores were above clinical cutoffs, with girls scoring higher than boys. Finally, 10.9% of children stated that they attempted to avoid needles because of fear. Once again, girls reported higher needle fear scores than boys and younger patients reported experiencing higher levels of needle fear.

Currently, total bile acids (TBAs) are the only diagnostic index for ICP, and its sensitivity and specificity have certain limitations. In this study, we aimed to develop potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of ICP. METHODS: Sixty pregnant women diagnosed with ICP and 48 healthy pregnant controls were enrolled in this study. We used the Agilent microRNA (miRNA) array followed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays to identify and validate the serum exosome miRNA profiles in ICP and healthy pregnant controls. We employed bioinformatics to identify metabolic processes associated with differentially expressed serum exosome miRNAs. RESULTS: The expression levels of hsa-miR-4271, hsa-miR-1275, and hsa-miR-6891-5p in maternal serum exosomes were significantly lower in ICP patients compared to controls; the diagnostic accuracy of hsa-miR-4271, hsa-miR-1275, and hsa-miR-6891-5p was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.861, 0.886, and 0.838, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a combination of the levels of hsa-miR-4271and hsa-miR-1275 afforded a significantly higher AUC (0.982). The non-error rate of a combination of all three exosome miRNAs was the highest (95%), thus more reliable ICP diagnosis. The expression levels of all three exosome miRNAs were negatively associated with TBAs. Furthermore, according to bioinformatics analysis, the three exosome miRNAs were related to lipid metabolism, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.

It is not known if the same inhibitory process might influence covert orienting in the absence of saccades, and consequently alter visual perception. In Experiment 1 (n=14), we measured orientation discrimination during a covert orienting task in which an uninformative exogenous visual cue preceded the onset of an oriented probe by 140 to 290 ms. In half of the trials the onset of the probe was accompanied by a brief irrelevant flash, a visual transient that would normally induce SI. We report a time-dependent inhibition of covert orienting in which the irrelevant flash impaired orientation discrimination accuracy when the probe followed the cue by 190 and 240 ms. The interference was more pronounced when the cue was incongruent with the probe location, suggesting an impact on the reorienting component of the attentional shift. In Experiment 2 (n=12), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the flash could occur within an earlier time range, or only within the later, reorienting range. We presented probes at congruent cue locations in a time window between 50 to 200 ms. Similarly to Experiment 1, discrimination performance was altered at 200 ms after the cue. We suggest that covert attention may be susceptible to similar inhibitory mechanisms that generate SI, especially in later stages of attentional shifting (> 200ms after a cue), typically associated with reorienting.","output":"Time-dependent inhibition of covert shift of attention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The basic tenets of oncoplastic surgery essentially includes volume displacement and volume replacement.

Forty-two patients consecutively admitted to the ICU of a French university hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 March 2020, and 29 April 2020, were included and classified in categories according to their renal function. Complete renal profiles and evolution during ICU stay were fully characterized in 34 patients. Univariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with AKI.

Thirty-two patients (94.1%) met diagnostic criteria for intrinsic renal injury with a mixed pattern of tubular and glomerular injuries within the first week of ICU admission, which lasted upon discharge. During their ICU stay, 24 patients (57.1%) presented AKI which was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.007), hemodynamic failure (p = 0.022), and more altered clearance at hospital discharge (p = 0.001).

Methods: This study uses qualitative data from large-scale web surveys distributed to SUD and MH providers between May and August 2020. At the end of these surveys, the following question was posed in free-response form:  Is there anything else you would like to say about use of telehealth during or after the COVID-19 pandemic?  The 391 responses to this question were analyzed for emergent themes using a conventional approach to content analysis. Results: Three major themes emerged in the data: COVID-specific experiences with telehealth, general experiences with telehealth, and recommendations to continue telehealth delivery. Convenience, access to new populations, and lack of commute were frequently cited advantages, while perceived ineffectiveness of and limited access to technology were frequently cited disadvantages. Also commonly mentioned was the relaxation of reimbursement regulations. Providers supported continuation of relaxed regulations, increased institutional support, and using a combination of telehealth and in-person care in their practices.

In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives.

Methods We conducted an observational cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW working in an acute NHS Trust during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, using serial self-collected saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples. We also collected self-assessed symptom profiles and isolation behaviours.

It is about adopting artificial intelligence to support the business strategy (Joda et al. 2020), searching for new business models (Kotarba, 2018), and considering afresh how to embed the social impact in the measure of the success of the business.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Digital Transformation for Sustainable Societies: The Prevailing Effect of COVID-19 Crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) for the management of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions is gaining popularity. Our aim was to analyze and present the clinical outcomes of EES for the management of these lesions in a community hospital setting. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 56 patients with sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions who underwent EES between 2010 and 2018. Results There was male predominance (53.6%) with a mean age of 54.9  13.7 years. Lesions were 45 pituitary adenomas, 5 meningiomas, 3 metastatic, 1 craniopharyngioma, 1 Rathke cyst, and 1 mucocele. Gross total excision was achieved in 57.1%, subtotal excision occurred in 37.5%, and decompression and biopsy were achieved in 5.4% patients. Postoperative vision normalized or improved in 27 patients (86.1%) and was stable in 4 patients (13.9%). Recovery of a preexisting hormonal deficit occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients, and a new hormonal deficit occurred in 9 patients (16.1%). The mean hospital stay was 6.1  4.9 days. Postoperative complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in 8 patients (14.3%). Four patients (7.1%) had meningitis. Diabetes insipidus was present in 19 patients (33.9%), and postoperative intracranial hematoma requiring evacuation was necessary in 2 patients (3.6%). The mean follow-up duration was 47.5  25.8 months. Lesion progression or recurrence requiring redo surgery occurred in 5 patients (8.9%). Regarding the learning curve, the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, meningitis, new hormonal deficits, and diabetes insipidus decreased in the second half of the patients. Conclusions EES provides an effective and safe surgical option with low morbidity and mortality for the treatment of sellar, suprasellar, and anterior skull base lesions in a community hospital setting.","output":"Challenges, Learning Curve, and Safety of Endoscopic Endonasal Surgery of Sellar-Suprasellar Lesions in a Community Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs by close contact with infected persons through droplets, the inhalation of infectious aerosols and the exposure to contaminated surface. Previously, we determined the virus stability on different types of surfaces under indoor and seasonal climatic conditions. SARS-CoV-2 survived the longest on surfaces under winter conditions, followed by spring/fall and summer conditions, suggesting the seasonal pattern of stability on surfaces. However, under natural conditions, the virus is secreted in various biological fluids from infected humans. In this respect, it remains unclear how long the virus survives in various types of biological fluids. This study explored the SARS-CoV-2 stability in human biological fluids under different environmental conditions and estimated the half-life. The virus was stable for up to 21 days in nasal mucus, sputum, saliva, tear, urine, blood, and semen; it remained infectious significantly longer under winter and spring/fall conditions than under summer conditions. In contrast, the virus was only stable up to 24 hours in feces and breast milk. These findings demonstrate the potential risk of infectious biological fluids in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and have implications for its seasonality.","output":"Seasonal stability of SARS-CoV-2 in biological fluids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duck is a source of protein as well as one of the most delicious poultry meats Duck meat has useful nutrition as well as dangerous cholesterol COVID-19 can worsen the diseases caused by cholesterol This study has an aim to observe if there is any correlation between duck meat consumption and production toward COVID-19 case This study uses secondary data as the primary source of data for research The sample are 5 ASEAN with potential duck market such as Indonesia, Philippine, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand The sample is divided into three, the number of duck meat production, meat consumption, and number of COVID-19 cases The result shows that the number of consumptions correlates with the number of deaths Thus, how processing duck into dishes also affects the cholesterol rate of the meat The more cholesterol, the worse for the body and can lead to death as a result of COVID-19 the number of productions does not correlate with the COVID-19 case, but to the Numbers of consumption ? 2020 EManuscript Technologies All rights reserved","output":"Duck meat, delicious yet low in unsaturated fat;comparative study between duck meat consumption in asean toward the number of covid cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19-pandemic forces hospitals to reorganize into a dual patient flow system.

Lack of high-quality evidence on the respiratory management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) has resulted in wide variation in clinical practice. METHODS: Using a Delphi process, an international panel of 39 experts developed clinical practice statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF in areas where evidence is absent or limited. Agreement was defined as achieved when > 70% experts voted for a given option on the Likert scale statement or > 80% voted for a particular option in multiple-choice questions. Stability was assessed between the two concluding rounds for each statement, using the non-parametric Chi-square (&#967;2) test (p < 005 was considered as unstable). RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16-24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

In the four countries, TB incidence and mortality rates displayed decreasing trends in men and women; except for the males from DRC that recorded an almost steady pattern in the trend of TB incidence between 1990 and 2019. TB incidence and mortality rates decreased according to the overall annual percentage changes over the adjusted age category in men and women of the four countries, and CAM registered the highest decrease. Although TB incidence and mortality rates increased with age between 1990 and 2019, the male gender was mainly associated with the upward behaviors of TB incidence rates, and the female gender association was with the upward behaviors of TB mortality rates. Males and females aged between 15C54 and 15C49 years old were evaluated as the population at high risks of TB incidence and mortality respectively in CAM, CAR, Chad, and DRC. The period and cohort relative risks (RRs) both declined in men and women of the four countries although there were some upward behaviors in their trends.

Chlamydia-related bacteria were added and classified into six different families and family-level lineages: the Criblamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Piscichlamydiaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, and Waddliaceae. While several members of the Chlamydiaceae family are known pathogens, recent studies showed diverse associations of Chlamydia-related bacteria with human and animal infections. Some of these latter bacteria might be of medical importance since, given their ability to replicate in free-living amoebae, they may also replicate efficiently in other phagocytic cells, including cells of the innate immune system. Thus, a new Chlamydiales-specific real-time PCR targeting the conserved 16S rRNA gene was developed.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact on the health and disease process according to the COVID-19 evolution in the Brazilian Indigenous population. METHODS: Data was collected from press releases by the Health Ministry and a descriptive analysis of the numbers of Indigenous individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil was carried out. RESULTS: In February 2021, there were 41,855 confirmed cases of Indigenous individuals infected by the SARS-CoV-2, including 4,387 active cases, 36,809 recovered cases, and 549 deaths. The Brazilian Indigenous population is distributed in over 300 ethnic groups and, due to the high number of deaths by the COVID-19, many of these groups are endangered. The elderly are the most affected age group, and they play a fundamental role among the Indigenous population for transmitting their customs mainly orally. Indigenous populations do not have proper access to transport to specialized health centers, since many areas are inaccessible and other cases require air or river transportation, which many times results in late assistance. When managing the COVID-19, it is important to emphasize the need for social isolation to prevent the virus from spreading among the Indigenous groups, mainly due to their contact with other ethnic groups represented by missionaries, hunters, and wood explorers, among others.

They are in excellent agreement with the simulations of a kinematic model accounting for stochastic and microhydrodynamic properties and, in particular, the flagella chirality. Theoretical analysis reveals the scaling laws behind the average rheotactic velocity at moderate shear rates using a chirality parameter and explains the reorientation dynamics leading to saturation at large shear rates from the marginal stability of a fixed point.

Traditional newspaper coverage is important amidst increasing disinformation, yet uncertainties make covering health risks and efforts to limit transmission difficult. This study assesses print and online newspaper coverage of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 for March 2020, when the global pandemic was declared, through August 2020 in three countries: Canada (with the lowest per-capita case and death rates during the study timeframe), the United Kingdom (with a pronounced early spike), and the United States (with persistently high rates). Tools previously validated for pandemic-related news records allow measurement of multiple indicators of scientific quality (i.e., reporting that reflects the state of scientific knowledge) and of sensationalism (i.e., strategies rendering news as more extraordinary than it really is). COVID-19 reporting had moderate scientific quality and low sensationalism across 1331 sampled articles in twelve newspapers spanning the political spectrums of the three countries. Newspapers oriented towards the populist-right had the lowest scientific quality in reporting, combined with very low sensationalism in some cases. Against a backdrop of world-leading disease rates, U.S. newspapers on the political left had more exposing coverage, e.g., focused on policy failures or misinformation, and more warning coverage, e.g., focused on the risks of the disease, compared to U.S. newspapers on the political right. Despite the generally assumed benefits of low sensationalism, pandemic-related coverage with low scientific quality that also failed to alert readers to public-health risks, misinformation, or policy failures may have exacerbated the public-health effects of the disease. Such complexities will likely remain central for both pandemic news media reporting and public-health strategies reliant upon it.","output":"News media coverage of COVID-19 public health and policy information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this work is to analyze the effects of control policies for the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Brazil This is done by considering an age-structured SEIR model with a quarantine class and two types of controls The first one studies the sensitivity with regard to the parameters of the basic reproductive number Ro which is calculated by a next generation method The second one evaluates different quarantine strategies by comparing their relative total number of deaths","output":"Assessing the Efficiency of Different Control Strategies for the Covid-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since February 12, 2020, approximately 6.5 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 190,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths have been reported in the United States (1,2).

In recent years, online communities have become a source of support for patients as well as a vehicle for discussion and collaboration among patients, clinicians, advocates, and researchers. The Breast Cancer Social Media (#BCSM) community has hosted weekly Twitter chats since 2011. Topics vary each week, and chats draw a diverse group of participants. Partnering with the #BCSM community, we used Twitter to gather data on barriers to care for patients with metastatic breast cancer and potential policy solutions. Metastatic breast cancer survival rates are low and in large part conditioned by time-sensitive access to care factors that might be improved through policy changes. OBJECTIVE: This study was part of an assessment of the barriers to care for metastatic breast cancer with the goal of offering policy solutions for the legislative session in California. METHODS: We provided 5 questions for a chat specific to metastatic breast cancer care barriers and potential policy solutions. These were discussed during the course of a #BCSM chat on November 18, 2019. We used Symplur (Symplur LLC) analytics to generate a transcript of tweets and a profile of participants. Responses to the questions are presented in this paper. RESULTS: There were 288 tweets from 42 users, generating 2.1 million impressions during the 1-hour chat. Participants included 23 patient advocates (most of whom were patients themselves), 7 doctors, 6 researchers or academics, 3 health care providers (2 nurses, 1 clinical psychologist), and 2 advocacy organizations. Participants noted communication gaps between patient and provider especially as related to the need for individualized medication dosing to minimize side effects and maximize quality of life. Timeliness of insurance company response, for example, to authorize treatments, was also a concern. Chat participants noted that palliative care is not well integrated into metastatic breast cancer care and that insurance company denials of coverage for these services were common. Regarding financial challenges, chat participants mentioned unexpected copays, changes in insurance drug formularies that made it difficult to anticipate drug costs, and limits on the number of physical therapy visits covered by insurance. Last, on the topic of disability benefits, participants expressed frustration about how to access disability benefits. When prompted for input regarding what health system and policy changes are necessary, participants suggested a number of ideas, including expanding the availability of nurse navigation for metastatic breast cancer, developing and offering a guide for the range of treatment and support resources patients with metastatic breast cancer, and improving access to clinical trials.

Though carbapenems are an effective treatment in the face of rising resistance, overuse drives carbapenem resistance (CR). We hypothesized that resistance to routinely used antimicrobials is common, and, despite frequent use of carbapenems, associated with an increased risk of inappropriate empiric treatment (IET), which in turn worsens clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with a culture-positive non-CR cUTI. Triple resistance (TR) was defined as resistance to > 3 of the following: 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. Multivariable models quantified the impact of TR and inappropriate empiric therapy (IET) on mortality, hospital LOS, and costs. RESULTS: Among 23,331 patients with cUTI, 3040 (13.0%) had a TR pathogen. Compared to patients with non-TR, those with TR were more likely male (57.6% vs. 47.7%, p < 0.001), black (17.9% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.001), and in the South (46.3% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.001). Patients with TR had higher chronic (median [IQR] Charlson score 3 [2, 4] vs. 2 [1, 4], p < 0.001) and acute (mechanical ventilation 7.0% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.001; ICU admission 22.3% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.001) disease burden. Despite greater prevalence of empiric carbapenem exposure (43.3% vs. 16.2%, p < 0.001), patient with TR were also more likely to receive IET (19.6% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) than those with non-TR. Although mortality was similar between groups, TR added 0.38 (95% CI 0.18, 0.49) days to LOS, and $754 (95% CI $406, $1103) to hospital costs. Both TR and IET impacted the outcomes among cUTI patients whose UTI was not catheter-associated (CAUTI), but had no effect on outcomes in CAUTI. CONCLUSIONS: TR occurs in 1 in 8 patients hospitalized with cUTI. It is associated with an increase in the risk of IET exposure, as well as a modest attributable prolongation of LOS and increase in total costs, particularly in the setting of non-CAUTI.

Methods: We included 127 symptomatic patients and 21 asymptomatic subjects with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and presence of cycle threshold. According to the level of care needed during hospitalization, the population was categorized as high-intensity (HIMC, n = 76) or low intensity medical care setting (LIMC, n = 51). Results: Viral load did not differ among asymptomatic, LIMC, and HIMC SARS-CoV-2 positive patients [4.4 (2.9C5.3) vs. 4.8 (3.6C6.1) vs. 4.6 (3.9C5.7) log10 copies/ml, respectively; p = 0.31]. Similar results were observed when asymptomatic individuals were compared to hospitalized patients [4.4 (2.9C5.3) vs. 4.68 (3.8C5.9) log10 copies/ml; p = 0.13]. When the study population was divided in High (HVL, n = 64) and Low Viral Load (LVL, n = 63) group no differences were observed in disease severity at diagnosis. Furthermore, LVL and HVL groups did not differ with regard to duration of hospital stay, number of bacterial co-infections, need for high-intensity medical care and number of deaths.

Treatment services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and counselling services. Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems. COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation. People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group.

Methods: Electronic health records were reviewed from SARS-CoV-2 patients at a single medical center in the United States that initiated mAb infusions in January 2021 with the support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Disaster Medical System. Patients who received mAbs were compared to untreated patients from the time period before mAb availability who met eligibility criteria for mAb treatment. We used logistic regression to measure the effect of mAb treatment on the risk of hospitalization or emergency department (E.D.) visit within 30 days of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Results: Of 598 COVID-19 patients, 270 (45%) received bamlanivimab and 328 (55%) were untreated. Two hundred and thirty-one patients (39%) were Hispanic.

Lowered visitor numbers and reduced staffing levels allowed a range of fauna to make their way indoors, bringing an increase in birds, rodents and insect pests. Silverfish are shy, so benefit from low occupancy in museums and present a potential vector for damage to books and paper. This study is the first to report changes in insect populations in museums and examines six years (2015C2020) trapping data for silverfish and similar insects (Lepismatidae): Lepisma saccharinum , Ctenolepisma calvum , Ctenolepisma longicaudatum and Ctenolepisma lineatum from: (i) the Technisches Museum Wien, (ii) Sch?nbrunn Palace, (iii) Hofburg Museum and a shorter record from (iv) Weltmuseum Wien. Analysis of the trap contents gives an impression that the number of insects caught had increased over time, but 2020 was distinctive and gave typically higher insect numbers during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to other years, especially for Lepisma saccharinum. Individual traps caught up to 100 silverfish in only a few weeks. Because silverfish usually need between four months to one year to become mature, we assume that it was increased activity during museum closure and not higher reproduction which led to higher numbers. The parts of the museums showing increased populations under lockdown were similar to the areas where they were more frequent in earlier years. This means that such areas deserve continued monitoring even when the museum is closed. No damage to paper objects were reported in the museums investigated. ? Silverfish trapped have generally increased over the years 2015C2020. ? During museum closures silverfish increased in places typically seen as habitats. ? Increased trapping arose because silverfish could range widely in unoccupied museums.

Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information concerning subjects' hand cleansing practices and patient load. RESULTS Of the 108 cultures, 107 (99.1%) were culture positive, yielding 15 separate organisms. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common transient flora, followed by Gram-positive cocci and fungi. Thirty-five (97.2%) ophthalmologists were culture positive for at least one resident and 8 (22.2%) ophthalmologists were culture positive for at least one transient organism, before patient contact. Regression models showed alcohol-based hand rub use, transient and resident floral load before patient contact, and patient load collectively accounted for 58.7% of the variance in resident floral load after patient contact. Use of alcohol-based hand rubs was associated with a mean resident floral reduction of 324.4 CFUs (95% confidence interval [CI] = 185.4 to 463.5; P < 0.01) and 31.6 CFUs (95% CI = 1.2 to 62.0; P < 0.05) after patient contact and handwashing, respectively. Handwashing with chlorhexidine was a significant predictor for transient floral load after handwashing (unstandardized beta = -17.2; 95% CI = -10.2 to -24.2; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The extent of contamination with pathogenic organisms after contact with eye outpatients, who have traditionally been perceived as relatively \\"clean,\\" was of concern.

Acute respiratory and renal failure as well as systemic coagulopathy are critical aspects of the morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs when IgG antibodies form against platelet factor 4-Heparin complex, resulting in platelet activation and removal, leading to a prothrombotic state. HIT is suspected when there is a platelet count decrease of more than 50% after exposure to heparin, along with hypercoagulability. Clinical Scoring systems like 4T Score (Thrombocytopenia, Timing, Thrombosis, no other cause of Thrombocytopenia) have been developed to assess the pretest probability of HIT. The use of unfractionated heparin, post-orthopedic and post-cardiac surgery state, female gender, and old age are recognized as risk factors for HIT. There is a nine-fold increased risk of developing HIT in patients requiring hemodialysis. ICU patients and patients with VTE without thrombocytopenia are considered to have low pre-test probability for HIT. Studies have shown that only 6% who are investigated serologically for HIT actually have the diagnosis. We conducted this study to assess the incidence and risk factors for HIT in COVID-19 positive patients and its impact on mortality. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who were COVID-19 positive and hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and June 26, 2020 at our institution. Patients with intermediate or high suspicion for HIT, based on 4T score of 4 or higher, underwent IgG-specific platelet factor 4(PF4)-dependent enzyme immune assay (EIA). Washed platelet assays such as serotonin release assay (SRA) and heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) were used as confirmatory tests in cases with intermediate or low optical density (OD) with EIA. The incidence of HIT, its impact on mortality, and positivity of IgG-specific PF4-EIA in COVID-19 patients were studied, and statistical analysis was done with X2 testing. Subgroup analysis was performed based on demographic factors and risk factors for HIT, including exposure to heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), history of or cancer, recent orthopedic or cardiac surgery, exposure to renal replacement therapy (RRT), and severity of disease (D-dimer >6 ULN, Acute Kidney Injury, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation requirement). These factors were analyzed by Fishers exact test to determine their impact on mortality. The hospital course for HIT antibody-positive patients was further analyzed to study the impact of COVID-19 related therapy, such as Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Hydroxychloroquine, Steroids, and anticoagulation after diagnosis of HIT. Results WEight out of 1265 hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients tested positive for IgG-specific platelet factor 4(PF4)-dependent enzyme immune assay (EIA+). Incidence of EIA+ in COVID-19 patients was 0.6%, which is significantly higher than in the general population 0.2% (p<.0001, 95% CI 0.25-1.20%). The incidence of thromboembolic events in EIA+ patients was 87.5%, significantly higher than the rate of 10.90% in all COVID-19 patients (p<.0001, CI 41.96- 86.98%). The mortality rate in EIA+ patients was 50%, significantly greater than the mortality rate of 12% in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p=.0011, CI 9.46-66.53). Serological confirmation of HIT diagnosis was 37.5% (2 had OD>1, 1 was SRA positive) which is significantly higher than confirmation of HIT in nonCOVID-19 patients 6% (p<.0001, 95% CI 29.57-85.32%). All 3 confirmed HIT patients (100%) had severe disease (3/3 required ICU admission, 2/3 required mechanical ventilation, the one not requiring mechanical ventilation required RRT). Conclusion Our study indicates incidence of HIT is higher in the COVID-19 population. The incidence of positive EIA for patients with intermediate to high 4T scores is also higher in COVID-19 positive patients. This can be attributed to the cytokine storm and severe sepsis seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our study also suggests that development of HIT can contribute to increased risk for thromboembolic events as well as mortality of COVID-19 patients, however, our study is limited due to small sample size. Therefore, prospective studies are needed to analyze the impact of HIT on morbidity, mortality and long-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

Collectively we found ourselves in a distributed state, reliant upon digital technologies to maintain social and professional connections. Some activities can translate unabated to a digital medium, with benefits, such as the convenience inherent in many online shopping and banking services. Other activities, particularly those which are socially engaged, including inclusive music-making or design, may need to be re-framed and re-thought due to the absence of in-person contact.In Northern Ireland, the Performance Without Barriers (PwB) research group works with disabled artists from the Drake Music Project Northern Ireland (DMNI) to identify ways in which technology can remove access barriers to music-making. Since disabled people are experts in their unique lived experience of disability, they must be involved in the design process, an approach known as participatory design. At the end of 2020, many of us are still adjusting to the new normal, only beginning to understand the impact of distributed digital living. In this article, we examine how the socially engaged work of PwB has been affected, changed and adapted during the pandemic throughout 2019 to 2020, expanding ideas of distributed creativity to the notion of distributed design.

The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the use of iliac crest autograft versus allograft from the same anatomic site in terms of union and recurrence. METHODS Forty-six patients with genovarum with or without medial compartment osteoarthritis were enrolled based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned into two groups. MOW-HTO was done using iliac crest allograft (23 patients) or autograft (23 patients) as void filler. Follow-up visits were done monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months until 1 year and then at 5th and 8th postoperative year. The clinical assessment of union, anatomical indices of proximal tibia, complications and WOMAC score were assessed for both groups. RESULTS The amount of correction (degrees), recurrence, complication rates, time to get symptom-free, radiologic union and knee scores was similar in both groups. The symptom-free time was 6.1 (SD = 0.9) weeks in autograft group versus 6.2 (SD = 0.8) weeks in allograft group (p = 0.73, 95% CI - 0.4 to 0.6). The time to radiologic union had a between-group difference of 0.3 weeks (p = 0.58, 95% CI - 1.6 to 0.9). There was one case of surgical site infection in graft harvest site. No nonunion or delayed union was encountered in either group. Fifty-two percent of the autograft patients reported more intense postoperative pain in iliac graft harvest site than tibial osteotomy site.

Health education has been proven to be a critical strategy in preventing a pandemic. However, socioeconomic characteristics may limit health education among low socioeconomic status groups. This study explores consumption-related health education inequality and the factors that contribute to this, which are variable across China during COVID-19. Methods The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is a cross-sectional study in China, based on an anonymous online survey from 7,715 samples in 85 cities. It employed machine-learning methods to assess household consumption and other contributing variates associated with health education during the pandemic. Concentration Index (CI) and Horizontal Index (HI) were used to measure consumption-related inequalities in health education, respectively. Moreover, Wagstaff decomposition analysis was employed to identify other contributing variables to health education inequality. Results The result indicates that participants with more education, better income, and positive consumption preferences undertake higher health education during COVID-19. The CI and HI of consumption-health education inequality are 0.0321 (P < 0.001) and 0.0416 (p < 0.001), respectively, which indicates that health education is concentrated in wealthy groups. We adapted Lasso regression to solve issues and omit variables. In terms of other socioeconomic characteristics, Annual Income was also a major contributor to health education inequalities, accounting for 27.1% (P < 0.001). The empirical results also suggests that education, health status, identification residence, and medical health insurance contribute to health education inequality. Conclusions The difference in Household consumption, annual income, rural and urban disparity, and private healthcare insurance are critical drivers of health education inequality. The government should pay more attention to promoting health education, and healthcare subside policy among vulnerable people.

However, the medical epidemiology and clinical profile for mild COVID-19 is poorly described in the United States. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 151 mildly symptomatic adults from Emory Healthcare COVID-19 screening clinics in Atlanta, Georgia from March 18 to June 16, 2020. Interview-based questionnaires captured participants demographics, epidemiological history, and clinical features. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to test for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Convalescent serum (13C74 days post symptom onset) from 19 participants was tested by an IgG ELISA. Descriptive and  (2) analyses were performed to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 cases compared to patients who tested negative. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were recruited. The majority were non-Hispanic white (51%), female (60%), middle-aged adults (46.3 y +/-15). Twenty-seven (17.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and most frequently reported fever (63%), cough (67%), fatigue (56%), and myalgias (56%). See Table 1. Fever was statistically more common in positive cases vs negative (63% vs 34%, p = 0.005). Cases also experienced loss of taste (22%) and loss of smell (19%) more frequently than non-cases (p=0.01 and p=0.03). Diarrhea (22% vs 23%) and shortness of breath (33% vs 36%) did not differ significantly between groups. None of the 14 PCR-negative participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 3 out of 5 COVID-19 cases tested positive for SARs-CoV-2-specific IgG.

METHODS: We did a cross-sectional online survey from March 2 to 2 April 2020 and a total of 19,379 healthcare workers from 25 provinces participated. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Frontline workers had higher prevalence estimates than non-frontline workers (depression: 18.2% vs. 13.9%; anxiety: 14.7% vs. 11.6%; PTSD: 6.1% vs. 4.6%). Subgroups who were nurses, were married or had dependent children reported higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD.

We report our initial experience and the technical details of dual microcatheter coil embolizations that were applied in these difficult lesions. METHOD AND RESULTS Eighty-five small aneurysms (<7 mm) that exhibited difficult configurations, such as a wide neck or an important branch vessel arising from the fundus, were successfully treated using a dual microcatheter technique. The packing attenuation, adverse events during the procedures, and angiographic occlusions from 21 very small aneurysm (3 mm) were recorded and compared with our coiling results of 64 small aneurysms (>3 mm, <7 mm). There were no significant differences in intraprocedural ruptures or procedure-related thromboembolisms between the two groups. At the last post-procedure clinical follow-up, a good clinical outcome (an modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2) was observed in 18 of the patients (85.7%). The recanalization rates at follow-up were significantly lower in the very small aneurysm group compared to the small aneurysm group (p < 0.05) and the mean packing density in the very small aneurysm group was significantly higher compared to the small aneurysm group (35.2% vs 24.8%, p < 0.05).

METHODS: This nationwide case-control and cohort study included all individuals in Denmark tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with PCR from 27 February 2020 to 26 July 2020. We estimated confounder-adjusted ORs for a positive test among all SARS-CoV-2 tested, and inverse probability of treatment weighted 30-day risk and risk ratios (RRs) of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality comparing current ACE-I/ARB use with calcium channel blocker (CCB) use and with non-use. RESULTS: The study included 13 501 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and 1 088 695 PCR-negative individuals. Users of ACE-I/ARB had a marginally increased rate of a positive PCR when compared with CCB users (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37), but not when compared with non-users (aOR 1.00 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09).Among PCR-positive individuals, 1466 (11%) were ACE-I/ARB users. The weighted risk of hospitalisation was 36.5% in ACE-I/ARB users and 43.3% in CCB users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02). The risk of ICU admission was 6.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 5.4% in CCB users (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.16), while the 30-day mortality was 12.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 13.9% in CCB users (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30).

Based on the Italian COVID-19 death surveillance, which collects data from all the hospitals throughout the country, we aimed to describe clinical features and care pathway of patients dying with COVID-19 and a preceding diagnosis of a PD. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of a representative sample of patients, who have died with COVID-19 in Italian hospitals between February 21st and August 3rd 2020, were drawn from medical charts, described and analysed by multinomial logistic regression according to the recorded psychiatric diagnosis: no PD, severe PD (SPD) (i.e. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders), common mental disorder (CMD) (i.e. depression without psychotic features, anxiety disorders). FINDINGS: the 4020 COVID-19 deaths included in the study took place in 365 hospitals across Italy. Out of the 4020 deceased patients, 84 (2?1%) had a previous SPD, 177 (4.4%) a CMD. The mean age at death was 78.0 (95%CI 77.6C78.3) years among patients without a PD, 71.8 (95%CI 69.3C72.0) among those with an SPD, 79.5 (95%CI 78.0C81.1) in individuals with a CMD. 2253 (61.2%) patients without a PD, 62 (73.8%) with an SPD, and 136 (78.2%) with a CMD were diagnosed with three or more non-psychiatric comorbidities. When we adjusted for clinically relevant variables, including hospital of death, we found that SPD patients died at a younger age than those without a PD (adjusted OR per 1 year increment 0.96; 95% CI 0.94C0.98). Women were significantly more represented among CMD patients compared to patients without previous psychiatric history (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.05C2.32). Hospital admission from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) was strongly associated with having an SPD (aOR 9.02; 95% CI 4.99C16.3) or a CMD (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.19C3.66). Comorbidity burden, fever, admission to intensive care and time from symptoms onset to nasopharyngeal swab did not result significantly associated with an SPD or with a CMD in comparison to those without any PD.

The total participants were 57, consisting of 29 lupus nephritis and 28 lupus without nephritis. TWEAK levels were determined by ELISA method; urine protein, urine erythrocyte, and leukocyte were examined by a urine autoanalyzer. Statistical analysis using MannCWhitney, Spearman correlation, KruskalCWallis, ROC curve analysis, and a 2  2 contingency table. This study showed a significant difference in TWEAK levels between lupus nephritis and lupus without nephritis (p < 0.05), but no significant difference between TWEAK level and renal domain scores of SLEDAI. There were significant correlations between TWEAK level and urine erythrocyte and urine protein, but there was no significant correlation with urine leukocytes. The sensitivity and specificity of TWEAK for determining LN were 72.4% and 72.5%, respectively, with AUC 0.77. TWEAK had a good diagnostic test for detecting lupus nephritis and substantially correlated with urine erythrocyte and urine protein.","output":"Analysis of TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis for detecting lupus nephritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexual assault (SA) survivors often attend sexual health clinics (SHC) for care relating to their assault.

Each article described the results of flawed research on one of four educational interventions to improve learning (Experiment 1 included articles about having a tidy classroom and exercising while learning; Experiment 2 included articles about using virtual/augmented reality and napping at school). Experiment 1 tested the impact of a single anecdote and found no significant effect on either participants evidence evaluations or decisions to implement the learning interventions. However, participants were more likely to adopt the more plausible intervention (tidy classroom) despite identifying that it was unsupported by the evidence, suggesting effects of prior beliefs. In Experiment 2, we tested whether this intervention effect was driven by differences in beliefs about intervention plausibility and included two additional interventions (virtual reality = high plausible, napping = low plausible). We again found that participants were more likely to implement high plausible than low plausible interventions, and that evidence quality was underweighed as a factor in these decisions. Together, these studies suggest that evidence-based decisions are more strongly determined by prior beliefs than beliefs about the quality of evidence itself.","output":"When and why do people act on flawed science?

Key parameters, such as the time-varying reproduction number, Rt at time t, are often inferred from incident time series, with the aim of informing policymakers on the growth rate of outbreaks or testing hypotheses about the effectiveness of public health interventions. However, the reliability of these inferences depends critically on reporting errors and latencies innate to those time series. While studies have proposed corrections for these issues, methodology for formally assessing how these noise sources degrade Rt estimate quality is lacking. By adapting Fisher information and experimental design theory, we develop an analytical framework to quantify the uncertainty induced by under-reporting and delays in reporting infections. This yields a novel metric, defined by the geometric means of reporting and cumulative delay probabilities, for ranking surveillance data informativeness. We apply this metric to two primary data sources for inferring Rt: epidemic case and death curves. We show that the assumption of death curves as more reliable, commonly made for acute infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza, is not obvious and possibly untrue in many settings.

The objective of this study was to evaluate if ex vivo intact CB nerve activity and in vivo whole body ventilatory responses to hypoxia were modified by alterations in succinate metabolism and mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) generation in the rat. Application of diethyl succinate (DESucc) caused concentration-dependent increases in chemoafferent frequency measuring approximately 10C30% of that induced by severe hypoxia. Inhibition of mitochondrial succinate metabolism by dimethyl malonate (DMM) evoked basal excitation and attenuated the rise in chemoafferent activity in hypoxia.

In awake animals, MitoT and SKQ1 attenuated the rise in respiratory frequency during hypoxia, and SKQ1 also significantly blunted the overall hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) by approximately 20%.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adapts and evolves rapidly in nature. With the availability of 16,092 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes in GISAID as of May 13th , we removed the poor-quality genomes and performed mutational profiling analysis for the remaining 11,183 viral genomes. Global analysis of all sequences identified all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome and critical SNPs with high mutation frequency that contributes to five-clade classification of global strains. A total of 119 SNPs was found with 74 non-synonymous mutations, 43 synonymous mutations, and 2 mutations in intergenic regions. Analysis of geographical pattern of mutational profiling for the whole genome reveals differences between each continent. A transition mutation from C to T represents the most mutation types across the genome, suggesting rapid evolution and adaptation of the virus in host. Amino acid (AA) deletions and insertions found across the genome results in changes in viral protein length and potential function alteration. Mutational profiling for each gene was analyzed and results show that nucleocapsid gene demonstrates the highest mutational frequency, followed by Nsp2, Nsp3, and Spike gene. We further focused on non-synonymous mutational distributions on four key viral proteins, spike with 75 mutations, RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase with 41 mutations, 3C-like protease with 22 mutations, and Papain-like protease with 10 mutations. Results show that non-synonymous mutations on critical sites of these four proteins pose great challenge for development of anti-viral drugs and other countering measures.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent and debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting 90% of patients. Symptoms seems multifactorial, but little is known about the contribution of cardiovascular morpho-functional alterations linked to comorbidities, to lifestyle, to MS itself or to drugs (i.e. mitoxantrone). AIM: to investigate the presence of cardiac alterations in MS patients, and to evaluate their impact on fatigue. METHODS: 24 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG), a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE), a six minutes walking test (6MWT) with Borg scale (BS), and two fatigue self-assessment scales, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, without traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF: smoke, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia; n = 12, 11 females), and group 2, with at least one CVRF (n = 12, 5 females). None of the patients had ever been on mitoxantrone therapy. No new control group was studied due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions , so the comparison was performed with general healthy population in internationally validated previous studies. RESULTS: No arrhythmias were found. In both MS groups all the TTE left ventricular (LV) systolic function parameters were depressed compared to the healthy population, but only the mean global longitudinal strain (GLS), the mean longitudinal strain rate (LSR) of LV and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PAPs) were statistically significant depressed compared to the healthy general population (p < 0.005): see table. This reduction was observed in both MS groups, while there were non significant differences among the two groups. TTE LV function depression significantly correlated to variation of parameters of fatigue , especially considering LV GLS in relation to BS values. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical biventricular systolic dysfunction is present in MS patients, and it seems to be linked to the disease itself without being influenced by CVRF.

Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS. Its pathogenesis is based on a novel two-path unifying theory of hemostasis and two-activation theory of the endothelium promoting molecular pathogenesis. Endotheliopathy activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. The former triggers the release inflammatory cytokines and the latter promotes exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) and platelet activation. Inflammatory pathway initiates inflammation, but microthrombotic pathway more seriously produces microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes, which become anchored on the injured endothelial cells, and causes disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT). DIT is a hemostatic disease due to lone activation of ULVWF path without activated tissue factor path. It leads to endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD), which orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and MODS. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome is the hematologic phenotype of EA-VMTD. ARDS is one of organ phenotypes among MODS associated with TTP-like syndrome. The most effective treatment of ARDS can be achieved by counteracting the activated microthrombotic pathway based on two novel hemostatic theories.","output":"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as an Organ Phenotype of Vascular Microthrombotic Disease: Based on Hemostatic Theory and Endothelial Molecular Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The review highlights the problem of finding new effective treatment strategies for COVID-19.

We found that the tobacco surcharge rate averaged approximately 14 percent and that it was associated with lower total enrollment as well as a reduced share of total enrollees who reported any tobacco use. Our analysis also found that tobacco surcharges have a significantly larger effect on tobacco users' share of enrollment in rural areas than in urban areas, which may in turn contribute to urban-rural health disparities. Given that tobacco surcharges may decrease Marketplace enrollment overall and shift the composition of enrollment away from tobacco users, our findings suggest that reducing tobacco surcharges may increase total Marketplace enrollment.","output":"Tobacco Surcharges Associated With Reduced ACA Marketplace Enrollment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pneumonia-like disease with highly transmittable and pathogenic properties caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which infects both animals and humans.

In addition, the development and progression of several human diseases are associated with dysregulation of miRNAs. In this regard, it has been shown that changes in miRNAs are linked to severity of COVID-19 especially in patients with respiratory diseases, diabetes, heart failure or kidney problems. Therefore, targeting these small noncoding-RNAs could potentially alleviate complications from COVID-19.

A specific list of ICF categories, an ICF Core Set (CS), has been developed for bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to determine commonalities in the ICF-CSs for these three disorders, and to identify relevant categories for the development of tentative ICF-CSs for severe mental disorders in general. METHODS The ICF categories of all three mental health conditions were examined and compared. RESULTS Comparison of the Comprehensive ICF-CSs for the three mental health conditions revealed a set of 34 common categories (i.e., 10 from the Body functions component, 14 from the Activities and participation component, and 10 Environmental factors ). These categories formed the proposed Comprehensive ICF-CS for severe mental disorders. A total of 11 categories were common to the Brief ICF-CSs of the three mental health conditions, and these formed the Brief ICF-CS for severe mental disorders (i.e., 3 from the Body functions component, 6 from the Activities and participation component, and 2 Environmental factors ). All the categories included refer to key aspects of functioning for severe mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS The proposed ICF-CSs for severe mental disorders may be applicable across a number of psychotic and affective disorders and they should prove useful for mental health services whose care remit covers a range of conditions.","output":"Towards an ICF Core Set for functioning assessment in severe mental disorders: Commonalities in bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health researchers and funders are increasingly consulting with stakeholders to set their research agendas but these activities are rarely evaluated. The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group (CCCG) conducted a priority-setting project for systematic reviews in partnership with stakeholders (consumers/patients, health professionals, policy-makers and others). In this paper, we aim to describe our evaluation of the projects processes and outcomes. METHODS: We used a 10-element conceptual framework designed to evaluate processes (e.g. stakeholder engagement, use of explicit process) and outcomes (e.g. improved decision-making quality, stakeholder acceptance and understanding) of health priority-setting. Data sources included empirical data (feedback surveys, project documents and CCCG editorial policies) and CCCG staff reflections. Data were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: The project met three and partially met two of the process elements, for example, by engaging key stakeholders throughout the project and using pre-determined and transparent methods that offered multiple and meaningful ways to contribute. The project met three and partially met two of the outcome elements. Stakeholders were satisfied with and accepted the process and an additional six Cochrane Review titles aligned with stakeholder priorities are now being conducted in partnership with stakeholders. The project has also directly influenced the editorial work of CCCG, for example, by shifting its organisational focus towards coproduction, and indirectly influenced the work of Cochranes prioritisation and coproduction activities. Some areas were identified as having room for improvement, for example, there was low participation by people from diverse backgrounds, stakeholders could contribute to most but not all project stages, and there was no formal way for stakeholders to appeal decisions at project end. In the 3 years since its completion, the Cochrane Reviews are nearing completion but none of the reviews have been published. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that our priority-setting methods were broadly in line with best practice and the project resulted in many positive outcomes beyond just identifying the top priorities for research.

This article analyzes how heads of state and heads of government in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden framed the problems and solutions to the spread of the virus during the pandemic's initial phase. A Foucauldian-inspired method of problematization guides the narrative analysis, complemented by governmentality, risk communication, and taskscape theories. The results of the analysis show how the individual is conceptualized as a central actor and whose practices are framed as crucial to overcoming the crisis. Through invoking a sense of responsibility, sacrifice, and current life during the pandemic as a difficult time, the speeches allude to how people through changed behavior can/sould, contribute to the greater good. The individual is positioned as a key cause of, and solution to the problem;however, construing the individual as an indispensable actor to overcoming the crisis also means that the individual is laid open for reprehension. To facilitate the spread of the containment message and to support individual understanding of overt risk, the four countries' leadership also augment their conceptualization of the crisis with ideas of national identity to inspire the individual to contribute to the \\"battle\\" and \\"defeat\\" of the virus. The leadership does also embrace the important role of the national government in controlling the outbreak and the role of science, and trust in science, are also emphasized. The speeches analyzed in this paper can be understood as governance technologies;the spatial disciplining and self-governance demanded by the regimes create subject positions for individuals or groups. A debate on the rights and responsibilities of the citizen is another aspect that comes to the fore, considering how the containment strategies in all four countries proclaim the individual as a core agent in circumscribing the virus, and hence the individual's activities as potentially damaging to the fight against the pandemic. This throws into question the connection between individual autonomy as a democratic right and disciplinary mechanisms, sometimes phrased encouragingly and at other times in an enforcing way.","output":"Communicating About COVID-19 in Four European Countries: Similarities and Differences in National Discourses in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on testing for common sexually transmitted infections. Specifically, changes are measured in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and case detection among patients aged 14-49 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: U.S. chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and positivity were analyzed on the basis of >18.6 million tests (13.6 million tests for female patients and 4.7 million tests for male patients) performed by a national reference clinical laboratory from January 2019 through June 2020. RESULTS: Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing reached a nadir in early April 2020, with decreases (relative to the baseline level) of 59% for female patients and 63% for male patients. Declines in testing were strongly associated with increases in weekly positivity rates for chlamydia (R2=0.96) and gonorrhea (R2=0.85). From March 2020 through June 2020, an expected 27,659 (26.4%) chlamydia and 5,577 (16.5%) gonorrhea cases were potentially missed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted routine sexually transmitted infection services, suggesting an increase in syndromic sexually transmitted infection testing and missed asymptomatic cases. Follow-up analyses will be needed to assess the long-term implications of missed screening opportunities. These findings should serve as a warning for the potential sexual and reproductive health implications that can be expected from the overall decline in testing and potential missed cases.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has required facilities to quickly respond to a myriad of infection prevention recommendations, as well as design their own protocols. The varied and changing guidance has been difficult for staff to absorb and has presented challenges for managing compliance. APPROACH: HCA Healthcare recognized the need for a coordinated approach to managing infection prevention guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and a mechanism for monitoring compliance and responding to implementation challenges remotely. This innovation consisted of a bundle of infection prevention guidance referred to as the Universal Protection Framework that collated existing recommendations into an easy-to-understand structure with four domains: core infection prevention practices, access control, distancing, and patient flow. This was supported by education and clear communication. A remote monitoring program that incorporated a combination of report review and virtual observation via videoconferencing using an on-site leader as a navigator for the discussion assessed 46 survey domains for compliance. RESULTS: This framework was implemented in a large health care system, and to date compliance has been monitored at 15 facilities. Overall, compliance was high (average, 90%). High compliance was seen with oversight and distribution of personal protective equipment, cohorting of COVID-19 patients, facility access controls, and employee exposure monitoring. Challenges were identified in compliance with social distancing and universal masking. CONCLUSION: Complex infection prevention expectations for COVID-19 can be communicated and implemented by bundling into a simple framework. This innovation also demonstrated that compliance can be measured remotely, which may be useful even after the pandemic challenges have passed.","output":"Universal Protection: Operationalizing Infection Prevention Guidance in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a cost and time crisis for most construction projects around the world. Adherence to COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites may prevent the occurrence of COVID-19 cases, which eliminates the risk of site closure. However, adding a disinfection process to the construction process, as mandated in COVID-19 response guidelines, increases overall construction cost and time. Conversely, however, not adding a disinfection process may result in COVID-19 cases among construction workers, which would delay construction and perhaps even cause closure of the construction site. Therefore, this study analyzed the feasibility of COVID-19 response guidelines for construction sites, especially the addition of a disinfection process, in terms of cost and time. To this end, CYClic Operations NEtwork (CYCLONE) models were developed to simulate the construction process, and a case study was conducted to validate the applicability of the suggested approach. The results showed that compliance with COVID-19 response guidelines increased the number of working days and the construction costs of the subject construction project, but because there was no more risk of construction site closure, the construction delays were short, and the liquidated damages were minimized. Through the method proposed in this study, it is possible to estimate construction cost and time before and after the COVID-19 pandemic;this method could be used to provide data for both owners and contractors to pro-actively recognize and respond to situations or damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The goal of this review is to systematically identify and describe the survey data and findings to date examining the effect on individual gambling and gambling disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 17 publications meeting inclusion criteria, the majority reported cross-sectional assessments (na??=a??11, 65%) and remainder were longitudinal in that they had earlier gambling data for participants (na??=a??6, 35%). Not surprisingly given the closure of land-based gambling, an overall reduction in gambling frequency and expenditure was reported in all studies. The estimate of the proportion of participants in both the general population and the population that gambles who increased overall gambling or online gambling was variable. The most consistent correlates of increased gambling during the lockdown were increased problem gambling severity, younger age groups, and being male. SUMMARY: These results suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling and problematic gambling are diverse - possibly causing a reduction in current or future problems in some, but also promoting increased problematic gambling in others. The longer-term implications of both the reduction in overall gambling, and the increase in some vulnerable groups are unclear, and requires assessment in subsequent follow-up studies. However, in the short term, individuals with existing gambling problems should be recognized as a vulnerable group.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on gambling and gambling disorder: emerging data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced scientists all over the world to focus their effort on searching for targeted drugs for coronavirus chemotherapy.

METHOD: We studied antibody responses in 500 patients following dual COVID-19 vaccination to assess the magnitude, correlates of response, stability and functional activity of the spike-specific antibody response with two different vaccine platforms. RESULTS: Spike-specific seroconversion post-vaccine was seen in 67% of patients compared to 100% of age-matched controls. Amongst responders, titres were 3.7 times lower than the control group. Antibody responses showed a 33% fall over the next 4 months. The use of an mRNA (n = 204) or adenovirus-based (n = 296) vaccine platform did not impact on antibody response. Male gender, BTKi therapy, prophylactic antibiotics use and low serum IgA/IgM were predictive of failure to respond. Antibody responses after CD20-targeted immunotherapy recovered 12 months post treatment. Post-vaccine sera from CLL patients with Spike-specific antibody response showed markedly reduced neutralisation of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant compared to healthy controls. Patients with previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection showed equivalent antibody levels and function as healthy donors after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate impaired antibody responses following dual COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CLL and further define patient risk groups. Furthermore, humoural protection against the globally dominant delta variant is markedly impaired in CLL patients and indicates the need for further optimisation of immune protection in this patient cohort.

Adult outpatients with T2DM and hypertension visiting hospitals and health centers were included in the study. A proportion to size allocation method was used to determine the required sample size per facility. Data was collected using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze data. A 95% confidence interval and p0.05 statistical significance was considered to determine factors associated with poor medication adherence. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients were included in the present study. About 57% of the patients reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed negative impacts on either of their follow-up visits, availability of medications, or affordability of prices. And, 21% have reported that they have been affected in all aspects. The overall magnitude of poor medication adherence was 72%.

METHODS This prospective study was conducted at two large multispecialty referral centers. Six patients (five males and one female) aged between 45 and 65 years with low rectal cancer (5 cm from the anal verge) were enrolled. Surgery was performed under electric stimulation of the pelvic autonomic nerves with observation of the electromyographic signals of the internal anal sphincter. RESULTS The minimally invasive transanal surgical approach enabled advantageous visualization of the pelvic autonomic nerves in all patients. In particular, extrinsic innervation to the internal anal sphincter near the levator muscle was consciously spared under electrophysiological confirmation.

We assessed, in an interim analysis, the efficacy of a carrageenan-based gel in reducing the risk of new detections of anal HPV among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM). METHODS The LIMIT-HPV study (Lubricant Investigation in Men to Inhibit Transmission of HPV Infection) is a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial conducted in Montreal, Canada. gbMSM were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a carrageenan-based or placebo gel. Participants were instructed to apply the gel to the anus, condom and/or partners' penis before and-as required-during receptive anal intercourse. Questionnaire data and anal samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. We estimated new detections of anal HPV infection(s) detected via Linear Array using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Participants recruited from February 2016 to December 2019 were randomly assigned to the carrageenan (n=127) or placebo (n=128) arm. The efficacy and safety analyses included 201 and 210 participants. The median follow-up time was 7.6 months (range: 0-28.5) in the carrageenan group and 9.3 months (range: 0-40.7) in the placebo group. The HR for new detections was 1.21 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.70): 69.4% and 65.1% new detections of HPV in the carrageenan and placebo arms, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the incidence of diagnostic errors in an outpatient department, where an artificial intelligence (AI)Cdriven automated medical historyCtaking system that generates differential diagnosis lists was implemented in clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study using data from a community hospital in Japan. We included patients aged 20 years and older who used an AI-driven, automated medical historyCtaking system that generates differential diagnosis lists in the outpatient department of internal medicine for whom the index visit was between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, followed by unplanned hospitalization within 14 days. The primary endpoint was the incidence of diagnostic errors, which were detected using the Revised Safer Dx Instrument by at least two independent reviewers. To evaluate the effect of differential diagnosis lists from the AI system on the incidence of diagnostic errors, we compared the incidence of these errors between a group where the AI system generated the final diagnosis in the differential diagnosis list and a group where the AI system did not generate the final diagnosis in the list; the Fisher exact test was used for comparison between these groups. For cases with confirmed diagnostic errors, further review was conducted to identify the contributing factors of these errors via discussion among three reviewers, using the Safer Dx Process Breakdown Supplement as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were analyzed. A final diagnosis was confirmed for 138 patients and was observed in the differential diagnosis list from the AI system for 69 patients. Diagnostic errors occurred in 16 out of 146 patients (11.0%, 95% CI 6.4%-17.2%). Although statistically insignificant, the incidence of diagnostic errors was lower in cases where the final diagnosis was included in the differential diagnosis list from the AI system than in cases where the final diagnosis was not included in the list (7.2% vs 15.9%, P=.18). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of diagnostic errors among patients in the outpatient department of internal medicine who used an automated medical historyCtaking system that generates differential diagnosis lists seemed to be lower than the previously reported incidence of diagnostic errors. This result suggests that the implementation of an automated medical historyCtaking system that generates differential diagnosis lists could be beneficial for diagnostic safety in the outpatient department of internal medicine.","output":"Incidence of Diagnostic Errors Among Unexpectedly Hospitalized Patients Using an Automated Medical HistoryCTaking System With a Differential Diagnosis Generator: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop an ECON-EPI network model to evaluate policies designed to improve health and economic outcomes during a pandemic. Relative to the standard epidemiological SIR set-up, we explicitly model social contacts among individuals and allow for heterogeneity in their number and stability. In addition, we embed the network in a structural economic model describing how contacts generate economic activity. We calibrate it to the New York metro area during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis and show three main results. First, the ECON-EPI network implies patterns of infections that better match the data compared to the standard SIR. The switching during the early phase of the pandemic from unstable to stable contacts is crucial for this result. Second, the model suggests the design of smart policies that reduce infections and at the same time boost economic activity. Third, the model shows that reopening sectors characterized by numerous and unstable contacts (such as large events or schools) too early leads to fast growth of infections.","output":"Pandemic Control in ECON-EPI Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The study aimed to target the current practices of the orthopaedic community in outpatient (OPD), emergency (ER) and surgical services (OT) during COVID-19 Material and method: This study surveyed 303 orthopaedic surgeons from all over Pakistan The survey had 30 questions targeting the setup of outpatient, emergency and operation services in orthopaedic departments of different hospitals in Pakistan Result: A total of 302 surgeons were included from 53 cities all over Pakistan Between 35-48% of the respondents reported lack of availability of standard operating procedures in OPD, ER and in OT Majority of the respondents noted that their OPD and surgical practice had been affected to some degree and 69% of the surgeons were only doing trauma surgery This trend was higher in younger consultants of less than 45 years of age (p&lt;0 001) Almost two-third of the surgeons, mostly senior (p=0 03) were using surgical masks as the only protective measure during various practices of OPD, ER and OT, while most of the setups were not assessing patients even for signs and symptoms of COVID Almost 89% of the orthopaedic community is facing definite to mild stress during this pandemic and this has significantly affected the senior surgeons (p=0 01) Conclusion: Our study highlighted that COVID-19 has resulted in marked changes to the practices of the majority of Pakistani orthopaedic surgeons Despite a sharp upsurge in the number of cases and mortality due to COVID-19, guidelines were still lacking at most of the settings and a substantial percentage of the orthopaedic community were not following adequate safety measures while attending to patients","output":"Orthopaedic Practices and Surgeries during COVID-19 in Pakistan - A Survey Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is time to do away with flashy science and outlandish claims","output":"All that glitters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corruption research in economics has a long history. Seminal early articles, and older findings contrast with newer developments which have as yet not been measured empirically; in particular the link between corruption and innovating activities suffers from multiple results, on both a national country and company or firm level. This paper examines the corruption-innovation link in transition and emerging countries as the decision to corrupt, and the ability to innovate may not be independent. An endogenous switching regression model is advocated as a suitably methodological way of modeling the joint determination of a firms innovation and possible bribes as it implies not only a selection between corrupted and non-corrupted firms, but also heterogeneous effects on innovative activities. The paper shows that, when the selection effect is adequately considered, different firms strategies arise. In particular, the treatment effect of corruption on innovation is positive for corrupting firms and negative for non-corrupting firms. Corrupting firms appear rational because paying bribes increases their innovative activities. However, non-corrupting firms also appear rational because in the presence of bribes, their innovating activities would be fewer. Thus, when the selection effect is adequately considered, the effects of so-called greasing-and-sanding-the-wheels can co-exist. Finally, the role of competition is also considered. Building on these results, future research can move forward to re-examine economic outcomes such as the productivity or the economic impact of corruption, in the presence (or absence) of selection processes.","output":"Is paying bribes worthwhile?

MIS-C was diagnosed if Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization criteria were fulfilled. RESULTS: Six cases were identified. The patients were critically ill and in nonfluid responsive shock (combined hypovolemic and cardiogenic or distributive shock). All had cardiac involvement. One patient had a Kawasaki shock-like presentation. All needed aggressive treatment with careful monitoring of fluid balance (because of associated cardiac dysfunction), early institution of vasoactive/inotropic supports, and use of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulins.

An inductive thematic analysis of their responses was completed. Social constructionist theory was utilised to contextualise themes and implications for program design. RESULTS: Participants highlighted the importance of co-creation with local learners and staff, the necessity to understand clinical context and the importance of relating to culture in the advancement of patient care.

We found that, compared to reading on a paper medium, reading on a smartphone elicits fewer sighs, promotes brain overactivity in the prefrontal cortex, and results in reduced comprehension. Furthermore, reading on a smartphone affected sigh frequency but not normal breathing, suggesting that normal breathing and sigh generation are mediated by pathways differentially influenced by the visual environment.

Similarly, the events which lead to a life-endangering immune cytokine storm, parallel those leading to a devastating socioeconomic crisis we termed a social cytokine storm. This new understanding may help explain why COVID-19, caused by a virus with no exceptional epidemiological capabilities, had inflicted such profound social and global toll. Understanding the set of events leading to an immunological and societal cytokine storms may aid scientists and policymakers to adopt more effective strategies that could reduce future disease morbidity and mortality, avert avoidable social cytokine storms, and minimize the socioeconomic toll. ABSTRACT: The adaptive immune system was sculpted to protect individuals, societies, and species since its inception, developing effective strategies to cope with emerging pathogens. Here, we show that similar successful or failed dynamics govern personal and societal responses to a pathogen as SARS-CoV2. Understanding the self-similarity between the health-protective measures taken to protect the individual or the society, help identify critical factors underlying the effectiveness of societal response to a pathogenic challenge. These include (1) the quick employment of adaptive-like, pathogen-specific strategies to cope with the threat including the development of memory-like responses; (2) enabling productive coaction and interaction within the society by employing effective decision-making processes; and (3) the quick inhibition of positive feedback loops generated by hazardous or false information. Learning from adaptive anti-pathogen immune responses, policymakers and scientists could reduce the direct damages associated with COVID-19 and avert an avoidable social cytokine storm with its ensuing socioeconomic damage.","output":"Immune Responses to SARS-CoV2 Mirror Societal Responses to COVID-19: Identifying Factors Underlying a Successful Viral Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The hypersensitivity reactions after docetaxel administration is a main concern in this study. The aim of this study is to check the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) after receiving a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone before docetaxel administration. METHOD In this retrospective study, 1 year data from Jan 1st 2018 to Dec 31st 2018 was retrieved from hospital information system (HIS). We examined 210 patients who visited hospital during the last 12 months during their cancer treatment and took dexamethasone orally 3 days prior to docetaxel administration or 20 mg intravenously before 15 minutes of docetaxel. RESULTS Out of 210 patients, only 50 patients were taking IV dexamethasone injection prior to docetaxel constitutes only 23.5% while patients who were taking oral dexamethasone were found to be 160 which constitutes 75%. There was no hypersensitivity reaction with oral and IV dexamethasone before docetaxel administration. Majority of the patients were without taking oral dexamethasone before docetaxel administration which not only saved time but also improve patient compliance. CONCLUSION No hypersensitivity reaction had been found either in oral or intravenous dexamethasone prior to docetaxel administration by using patient data from Hospital Information System (HIS). However, intravenous dexamethasone not only improve patient compliance but also reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions but the cost of intravenous dexamethasone is higher than the cost of oral dexamethasone. In conclusion, single dose of intravenous IV dexamethasone is preferred treatment option.","output":"Comparative study of oral and IV dexamethasone premedication in the prevention of docetaxel induced allergic reactions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) serological tests is massive.

METHODS: Field-based epidemiological methods were used to investigate cases and their close contacts. Real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for all collected specimens. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by Chemiluminescence and Gold immnnochromatography (GICA). RESULTS: The outbreak was a family cluster with an attack rate of 80% (4/5). The first case in this family was a 3-month-old infant. The transmission chain was confirmed from infant to adults (her father, mother and grandmother). Fecal tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained positive for 37 days after the infant was discharged. The infants grandmother was confirmed to be positive 2 days after the infant was discharged from hospital. Patients A (3-month-old female), B (patient As father), C (patient As grandmother), and D (patient As mother) had positive serum IgG and negative IgM, but patients As grandfather serum IgG and IgM were negative.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to both ED operations and outpatient care, yet little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ED-based HIV screening programs. We hypothesized that our electronic medical record (EMR) triggered HIV screening program would continue to identify new HIV positive patients and link them to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of ED patients screened for HIV and compared the average monthly tests performed, number of confirmed HIV positive cases, and rates of linkage to care before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used 3/13/2020 as the start date for the pandemic and compared data in a 5-month period prior to the pandemic (limited to initiation of EMR triggered HIV screening) and a 9-month period during the pandemic. Two tailed t-tests were used for comparison of means. Results: A total of 20,825 patients were screened for HIV from 11/18/2019 to 12/12/2020 (8,417 pre-pandemic and 12,408 during the pandemic). On average, more HIV screening tests were performed in the pre-pandemic period compared to the pandemic period (1,683/month pre-pandemic versus 1,379/month during pandemic). However, when accounting for ED volume changes, a similar rate of patients in the pre-pandemic period (35.8% of all patients seen in the ED) were screened compared to during the pandemic (34.7% of all patients seen). In the pre-pandemic period 11/18/2020 C 3/12/2020, a total of 25 patients were diagnosed with HIV and all patients were linked to care. In the pandemic period 3/13/2020 C 12/12/2020, 27 patients were diagnosed with HIV. Of the 27 patients diagnosed, 22 (81%) were linked to care. Two patients died prior to attending specialist appointments during the pandemic (88% linkage to care accounting for deaths). The average time to the first attended specialist appointments for non-admitted patients was not significantly greater during the pandemic period (6.0 days pre-pandemic vs. 6.9 days during pandemic, p=0.55). Conclusion: EMR-generated HIV screening allows for continued efforts to diagnose and link patients to care despite the global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of disruption to screening rates may be partly due to the minimal disruption of the screening and the linkage to blood tests being performed for clinical care. These efforts are critical to the mission to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Prolonged respiratory failure is common in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the disease process caused by infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tracheostomy, although posing potential risk to the operative team and other healthcare workers, may be beneficial for safe weaning of sedation and ventilator support. However, short- and long-term outcomes remain largely unknown. METHODS: A prospectively collected database of patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy at a major medical center in New York City between April 4 and April 30, 2020 was reviewed. The primary endpoint was need for continued mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, sedation weaning, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Patient characteristics, perioperative conditions, and outcomes between percutaneous and open groups were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 67 consecutive patients underwent tracheostomy, including 48 males and 19 females with a median age of 66 years [interquartile range (IQR) 52-72]. Two surgeons alternated techniques, with 35 tracheostomies performed percutaneously and 32 via an open approach. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 23 days (IQR 20-26). At a median follow-up of 26 days, 52 patients (78%) no longer required mechanical ventilation and 58 patients (87%) were off continuous sedation. Five patients (7.5%) died of systemic causes. There were 11 total complications (16%) in 10 patients, most of which involved minor bleeding. There were no significant differences in outcomes between percutaneous and open methods. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy under apneic conditions by either percutaneous or open technique can be safely performed in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Tracheostomy facilitated weaning from continuous intravenous sedation and mechanical ventilation. Continued follow-up of these patients to ascertain long-term outcome data is ongoing.","output":"Percutaneous and Open Tracheostomy in Patients with COVID-19: Comparison and Outcomes of an Institutional Series in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foundation of Applied Mathematics is one of the mathematics servicing courses for Diploma of Applied Science programme in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.

The course project of the senior course was designed in such a way that it helps in simultaneously attaining the objectives of the senior and capstone courses, that the students were taking at the same time. It is known that the MPL approach enhances the critical thinking capacity of students which is also a major outcome of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The developed project ensures the fulfillment of a series of SLOs, that are concentrated on soft engineering and project management skills. The difficulties of adopting the MPL method for the senior level courses are in aligning the project towards fulfilling the learning outcomes of every individual course. The study also provides the students feedback on online assessment techniques incorporated with the MPL, due to online teaching during COVID-19 pandemic. In order to provide a benchmark and to highlight the obtained results, the innovative teaching approaches were compared to conventional methods taught on the same senior course in a previous semester.

However, events regulating EBV infection at early stages of the disease and the role of EBV in disease pathogenesis are largely undefined. Genetic alterations leading to activation of cyclin D1 signaling in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cells have been postulated to predispose cells to EBV infection. We previously reported that loss of p16, a negative regulator of cyclin D1 signaling, is a frequent feature of NPC tumors. Here, we report that early premalignant lesions of nasopharyngeal epithelium overexpress cyclin D1. Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin D1 is closely associated with EBV infection. Therefore we investigated the potential role of cyclin D1 overexpression in dysplastic NPE cells in vitro. In human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized NPE cells, overexpression of cyclin D1 or a p16-resistant form of CDK4 (CDK4(R24C)) suppressed differentiation. This suppression may have implications for the close association of EBV infection with undifferentiated NPC. In these in vitro models, we found that cellular growth arrest and senescence occurred in EBV-infected cell populations immediately after infection. Nevertheless, overexpression of cyclin D1 or a p16-resistant form of CDK4 or knockdown of p16 in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized NPE cell lines could counteract the EBV-induced growth arrest and senescence.

Using PHI-BLAST and the viral protease cleavage site sequences, we searched the human proteome for host targets and analyzed the hit results. Although the polyprotein and host proteins related to the suppression of the innate immune responses may be the primary targets of these viral proteases, we identified other cleavable host proteins.

The underlying reasons of disease susceptibility are unknown, but often include a variable immune response in lungs. Recently, we identified a surprising novel role of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R), a primarily lymphoid-associated regulator, in fetal-specified, lung-resident macrophage development. Here, we report that traditional, hematopoietic stem cell-derived myeloid cells in the adult lung, peripheral blood, and bone marrow also depend on IL7R expression. Using single and double germline knockout models, we found that eosinophil numbers were reduced upon deletion of IL7R. We then employed two Cre recombinase models in lineage tracing experiments to test whether these cells developed through an IL7R+ pathway. Despite the impact of IL7R deletion, IL7R-Cre labeled only a minimal fraction of eosinophils. We therefore examined the intrinsic versus extrinsic requirement for IL7R in the production of eosinophils using reciprocal hematopoietic stem cell transplantation assays. These assays revealed that extrinsic, but not eosinophil-intrinsic, IL7R is required for eosinophil reconstitution by HSCs in the adult lung. To determine which external factors may be influencing eosinophil development and survival, we performed a cytokine array analysis between wild-type and IL7R-deficient mice and found several differentially regulated proteins.

METHODS: A total of 1,039 adults (442 from Minnesota, United States, and 597 from Hong Kong) living with at least one family member completed an online survey about COVID-19-related experiences, mental health, individual resilience and family resilience from May 20 to June 30, 2020. Predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were examined separately using hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS: In both regions, pandemic-related stressors predicted higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Individual resilience and two domains of family resilience were associated with positive mental health. In Minnesota, higher levels of individual resilience buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and depressive symptoms; higher levels of family communication and problem solving also buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and stress symptoms. In Hong Kong, higher family-level positive outlook magnified the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and anxiety symptoms.

Although KRL is used daily by about 973,366 residents to carry out their activities, some factors influence its usage. Therefore, this study aims to identify the critical elements that affect train services and the patterns of relationships amongst actors to construct a model for long-term sustainability. This study was carried out using the Micmac and Mactor methods. Micmac is a causal structural matrix that can investigate the relationship between parameters in a system. The Mactor technique, on the other hand, is applied to a variety of tactics involving many actors and a set of related interests and goals. The results showed five critical variables for sustainable urban rail service, namely Safety, Capital, Eco monitoring and evaluation, Eco plan, and COVID control are needed. Meanwhile, The General Administration of Railways, Ministry of Transport, and Indonesian commuter train company are two institutions or actors that are very influential in mobilizing the safety of KRL users amid a pandemic to ensure the continuity of train services. This study also finds that critical variables, key actors, and rail destinations strongly influence the sustainability of social, economic, and environmental aspects of urban rail transportation services.

Results: Findings from this study provide valuable insights from people with lived experience and staff on the complexity underpinning high mortality rates for individuals experiencing multiple and complex needs. Mental ill-health and substance misuse (often co-occurring dual diagnosis) were highlighted as significant factors underlying premature mortality among multiple and complex needs groups. Potential triggers to identify people at-risk included critical life events (e.g. bereavement, relationship breakdown) and transitions (e.g. release from prison, completion of drug treatment). Early prevention, particularly supporting young people experiencing adverse childhood experiences was also highlighted as a priority. Conclusion: High mortality in MCN groups may be reduced by addressing dual diagnosis, providing more support at critical life events, and investing in early prevention efforts.

Our aim was to study the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein specific antibodies in health care workers with occupational exposure to COVID-19 in Turku, Finland, from May to December 2020. METHODS Health care workers of Turku University Hospital units caring for COVID-19 patients or handling clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples were invited to participate in the study. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein specific IgG antibodies were analysed with in-house enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS At study enrolment, only one of the 222 (0.5%) study participants was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 protein specific antibodies. Two additional study participants (2/222, 0.9%) seroconverted during the follow-up. All these participants were diagnosed with a RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 infection before turning seropositive. CONCLUSION In our study population, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity remained low. The absence of seropositive cases without previous RT-PCR confirmed infections demonstrate good access to diagnostics. In addition to high vaccine coverage, high standards of infection prevention practices and use of standard personal protective equipment seem sufficient in preventing occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting with low number of circulating virus.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study compared COVID-19 daily disease risk in 3 population-based groups of neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada, defined by their intervention-specific vaccine coverage at the neighborhood level: the primary intervention group (500 or more vaccinated persons per 10 000 persons), secondary intervention group (95 to 499), and control group (0 to 50). The groups were compared within each of 3 time periods: before intervention (December 1, 2020, to March 16, 2021), during and immediately after intervention (March 17 to April 17, 2021), and 3 weeks after the intervention midpoint (April 18 to July 18, 2021). Data were analyzed between June 2021 and November 2021. EXPOSURES: Vaccination targeted parents and teachers of children attending the 32 schools and 48 childcare centers in 2 adjacent neighborhoods with highest local transmission (case counts) of Alpha variant shortly after its introduction. Participants were invited to receive 1 dose of mRNA vaccine between March 22 and April 9, 2021 (before vaccine was available to these age groups). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: COVID-19 risk in 3 groups of neighborhoods based on intervention-specific vaccine coverage. RESULTS: A total of 11 794 residents were immunized, with a mean (SD) age of 43 (8) years (range, 16-93 years); 5766 participants (48.9%) lived in a targeted neighborhood, and 9784 (83.0%) were parents. COVID-19 risk in the primary intervention group was significantly higher than in the control group before (unadjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.58; 95% CI 1.52-1.65) and during (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.52-1.76) intervention, and reached a level similar to the other groups in the weeks following the intervention (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.12).

To understand the health profile of older adults in Brazil is fundamental for planning public policies. METHODS: The estimates were derived from data obtained through the collaboration between the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics provided the population estimates. Data on causes of death came from the Mortality Information System. To calculate morbidity, population-based studies on the prevalence of diseases in Brazil were comprehensively searched, in addition to information obtained from national databases such as the Hospital Information System, the Outpatient Information System, and the Injury Information System. We presented the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates among Brazilian older adults (60+ years old) for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), from 2000 to 2017. RESULTS: LE at birth significantly increased from 71.3 years (95% UI to 70.9-71.8) to 75.2 years (95% UI 74.7-75.7). There was a trend of increasing HALE, from 62.2 years (95% UI 59.54-64.5) to 65.5 years (95% UI 62.6-68.0). The proportion of DALYs among older adults increased from 7.3 to 10.3%. Chronic noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death among middle aged and older adults, while Alzheimers disease is a leading cause only among older adults. Mood disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and hearing or vision losses are among the leading causes of disability. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in LE and the decrease of the DALYs rates are probably results of the improvement of social conditions and health policies. However, the smaller increase of HALE than LE means that despite living more, people spend a substantial time of their old age with disability and illness. Preventable or potentially controllable diseases are responsible for most of the burden of disease among Brazilian older adults.

The objective is to further understand the effects of guidance and adherence on the interventions potential to induce symptom change.

We evaluated the factors affecting the frequency, clinical course, and outcome of COVID-19 in patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents. METHODS Patients with rheumatoid diseases and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents were evaluated retrospectively. The laboratory data in routine visits, frequency of COVID-19, pneumonia, hospitalization and/or intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up and, mortality were recorded. The factors related to COVID-19 frequency and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 324 patients (177 males [54.6%] and 147 females [45.4%], mean age: 45.312.16 years) was included in the study. In all, 44 (13.6%) patients had COVID-19; of these, 11 (25%) developed pneumonia, 7 (15.9%) were hospitalized, and 1 (2.3%) was followed up in ICU. There was no mortality. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were older (mean age: 5211 years versus 4112 years, p=0.01), had hypertension and coronary artery disease more frequently (5 cases [55.6%] versus 4 cases [44.4], p=0.02 and 2 cases [100%] versus 0 cases [0%], p=0.014, respectively), and lower eosinophil % (1.351.79% versus 2.31.45%, p=0.016).

HCWs aged &#8805;18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Qubec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Qubec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19.

Tracheotomy is the most common surgery performed on ICU patients and can affect the duration of ICU care. We studied the association between when tracheotomy occurs and ICU stay length, mortality, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Methods: Multicentre prospective cohort including all COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in 36 hospitals in Spain who received invasive mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy between 11 March and 20 July 2020. We used a target emulation trial framework to study the causal effects of early (7 to 10 days post-intubation) versus late (>10 days) tracheotomy on time from tracheotomy to weaning, postoperative mortality, and tracheotomy complications. Cause-specific Cox models were used for the first two outcomes and Poisson regression for the third, all adjusted for potential confounders. Findings: We included 696 patients, of whom 142 (20.4%) received early tracheotomy. Using late tracheotomy as the reference group, multivariable cause-specific analysis showed that early tracheotomy was associated with faster post-tracheotomy weaning (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.28 [1.01 to 1.61]) without differences in mortality (HR [95% CI]: 0.94 [0.65 to 1.36]) or intraoperative or postoperative complications (adjusted rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.56 [0.23 to 1.38] and 1.31 [0.89 to 1.93], respectively). Interpretation: Early tracheotomy reduced post-tracheotomy weaning time, resulting in fewer mechanical ventilation days and shorter ICU stays, without changing complication or mortality rates.

To help ensure that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed in the event of a new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, many countries have extended vaccination to adolescents (those aged 12-17 years) and may consider further extending to children aged 5-11 years. However, there is considerable debate about whether or not to vaccinate healthy adolescents and children against SARS-CoV-2 because, while vaccination of children and adolescents may limit transmission from these groups to other, more vulnerable groups, adolescents and children themselves have limited risk of severe disease if infected and may experience adverse events from vaccination. To quantify the benefits of extending COVID-19 vaccination beyond adults we compare daily cases, hospital admissions, and intensive care (IC) admissions for vaccination in adults only, those 12 years and above, and those 5 years and above. Methods and Findings: We developed a deterministic, age-structured susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to simulate disease outcomes (e.g., cases, hospital admissions, IC admissions) under different vaccination scenarios. The model is partitioned into 10-year age bands (0-9, 10-19, ..., 70-79, 80+) and accounts for differences in susceptibility and infectiousness by age group, seasonality in transmission rate, modes of vaccine protection (e.g., infection, transmission), and vaccine characteristics (e.g., vaccine effectiveness). Model parameters are estimated by fitting the model piecewise to daily cases from the Dutch notification database Osiris from 01 January 2020 to 22 June 2021. Forward simulations are performed from 22 June 2021 to 31 March 2022. We performed sensitivity analyses in which vaccine-induced immunity waned. We found that upon relaxation of all non-pharmaceutical control measures a large wave occurred regardless of vaccination strategy. We found overall reductions of 5.7% (4.4%, 6.9%) of cases, 2.0% (0.7%, 3.2%) of hospital admissions, and 1.7% (0.6%, 2.8%) of IC admissions when those 12 years and above were vaccinated compared to vaccinating only adults. When those 5 years and above were vaccinated we observed reductions of 8.7% (7.5%, 9.9%) of cases, 3.2% (2.0%, 4.5%) of hospital admissions, and 2.4% (1.2%, 3.5%) of IC admissions compared to vaccination in adults only. Benefits of extending vaccination were larger within the age groups included in the vaccination program extension than in other age groups. The benefits of vaccinating adolescents and children were smaller if vaccine protection against infection, hospitalization, and transmission (once infected) wanes. Discussion: Our results highlight the benefits of extending COVID-19 vaccination programs beyond adults to reduce infections and severe outcomes in adolescents and children and in the wider population. A reduction of infections in school-aged children/adolescents may have the added benefit of reducing the need for school closures during a new wave. Additional control measures may be required in future to prevent a large wave despite vaccination program extensions. While the results presented here are based on population characteristics and the COVID-19 vaccination program in The Netherlands, they may provide valuable insights for other countries who are considering COVID-19 vaccination program extensions.","output":"The impact of vaccinating adolescents and children on COVID-19 disease outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus 2 is neutralized by proteins that block receptor\\\\binding sites on spikes that project from the viral envelope.

METHODS: A mixture of methacrylic acid, gelatin, and tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride, called MAGAT gel, was fabricated. One MAGAT gel for each Linac and MR-Linac was irradiated under six gantry angles. A 6 MV photon beam of Linac and a 6 MV flattening filter free beam of MR-Linac were delivered to two MAGAT gels and EBT3 films. MR images were acquired by MR-Linac with a clinical sequence (i.e., TrueFISP). The 3D star shot analysis for seven consecutive slices of the MR images with TrueFISP was performed. The 2D star shot analysis for the central plane of the gel was compared to the results from the EBT3 films. The radius of isocircle (ICr ) and the distance between the center of the circle and the center marked on the image (ICd ) were evaluated. RESULTS: For MR-Linac with MAGAT gel measurements, ICd at the central plane was 0.46 mm for TrueFISP. Compared to EBT3 film measurements, the differences in ICd and ICr for both Linac and MR-Linac were within 0.11 and 0.13 mm, respectively. For the 3D analysis, seven consecutive slices of TrueFISP images were analyzed and the maximum radii of isocircles (ICr_max ) were 0.18 mm for Linac and 0.73 mm for MR-Linac.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized clinical quality improvement trial at the University of California, Los Angeles Health of 2339 patients enrolled in a FIT mailing program from August 28, 2019, to September 20, 2020, patients were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group, and the screening completion rate was measured at 6 months. Participants were average-risk managed care patients aged 50 to 75 years, with a valid mailing address, no mailed CRC outreach in the previous 6 months, and an active electronic health record (EHR) patient portal who were due for CRC screening. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either (1) the standard FIT mailed outreach (control group) or (2) the standard FIT mailed outreach plus an automated primer to notify patients of the upcoming mailed FIT sent through the electronic patient portal (intervention group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the screening completion rate (ie, returning the FIT). Secondary outcomes were (1) were the time to CRC screening from the FIT mailing date, (2) screening modality completed, and (3) the effect of opening the electronic primer on screening completion rate. RESULTS: The study included 2339 patients (1346 women [57.5%]; mean [SD] age, 58.9 [7.5] years). The screening completion rate was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (37.6% [445 of 1182] vs 32.1% [371 of 1157]; P = .005). The time to screening was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; P = .003). The proportion of each screening test modality completed was similar in both groups. In a subanalysis of the 900 of 1182 patients (76.1%) in the intervention group who opened the patient portal primer message, there was a 7.3Cpercentage point (95% CI, 2.3-12.4 percentage points) increase in CRC screening (local mean treatment effect; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of an electronic patient portal primer message in a mailed FIT outreach program led to a significant increase in CRC screening and improvement in the time to screening completion.

MIS-C typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present in vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Empiric treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other immunomodulatory agents have been frequently used. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known. This review describes the published data on MIS-C, focusing on cardiac complications, and provides clinical considerations for cardiac evaluation and follow-up.","output":"Review of Cardiac Involvement in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a 12-year retrospective study to determine the effects that the community respiratory-virus species and the localization of respiratory-tract virus infection have on severe airflow decline, a serious and fatal complication occurring after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

It has caused huge economic losses to the global pig industry and that is why it is necessary to develop effective new treatment compounds. Zedoary turmeric oil has been used for treating myocarditis. Curcumol extracted from the roots of curcuma is one of the main active ingredient of zedoary turmeric oil. The anti-EMCV activity of curcumol along with the molecular mechanisms involved with a focus on IFN- signaling pathway was investigated in this study. METHOD: 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the maximum non-toxic concentration (MNTC), 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)), maximum inhibition rate (MIR) and 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) against EMCV. Through EMCV load, the anti-viral effect of curcumol was quantitatively determined using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The effect of curcumol on the expression of IFN- was investigated using real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the amounts of MDA5, MAVS, TANK, IRF3 and P-IRF3 proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK-293 T) cells infected with EMCV. RESULTS: The results of MTT showed that compared with the ribavirin positive control group, the maximum inhibition ratio (MIR) of curcumol was greater but the selection index (SI) value was much smaller than that of ribavirin. The results of qPCR showed that curcumol and ribavirin significantly reduced the replication of EMCV in HEK-293 T cells. The curcumol (0.025 mg/mL) treatment has significantly increased IFN- mRNA expression in the EMCV-infected HEK-293 T cells while ribavirin treatment did not. The results of ELISA showed that curcumol (0.025 mg/mL and 0.0125 mg/mL) has significantly increased the expression of IFN- protein in EMCV-infected HEK-293 T cells. The results of Western blot showed that curcumol can inhibit the degradation of TANK protein mediated by EMCV and promote the expression of MDA5 and P-IRF3, while the protein expression level of MAVS and IRF3 remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Curcumol has biological activity against EMCV which we suggest that IFN- signaling pathway is one of its mechanisms.

The response to the pandemic had already been thoroughly politicized several weeks earlier such that news and information about the pandemic were mediated by political media systems. While the rest of the American media ecosystem focused on describing the pandemic, its economic costs, and criticizing the president for his response, conservative media presented a thoroughly partisan view of events and proactively defended and supported the actions and inactions of the president. For audiences of conservative media, information about the pandemic was communicated not through politically neutral public health authorities but was instead filtered and propagated through media channels shaped by many decades of partisan politics. The mainstream media coverage of the pandemic that got the most attention was highly critical of the presidents response, which may have deepened the politically-rooted differences in perspectives on the pandemic. Compared to conservative media, there was far greater deference among media sources on the center and left to views and perspectives of public health authorities and experts.This report, based on an ecosystem-wide analysis of political media coverage, spans the period of March, April, and May, when the spread and magnitude of the pandemic in the United States became clear, and the response of the government was communicated to the public and debated in the media. In March, coverage of the pandemic dominated political media on both sides of the political spectrum, though significantly less so on the right. The proportion of media attention to the pandemic diminished in April and May on the left. On the right, attention to the pandemic dropped off steeply. In April, conservative media and their audiences devoted substantial attention to coverage of the allegations of sexual harassment by Tara Reade against Joe Biden. In May, there was far more attention in conservative media to relitigating the origins of the Russia investigation under the banner of Obamagate than to the pandemic, which had already exacted a terrible cost and was nowhere near being under control. The collective judgment of the conservative media ecosystem was that this largely unsubstantiated storyline rooted in grievance politics was more deserving of the attention of the American public. For Biden supporters, the drop in attention to Covid-19 was picked up by negative coverage of the Trump administration on other issues. Sanders supporters followed a similar path until the death of George Floyd at the end May took up their attention. This was not replicated in the Biden set. Consistent with our findings in January-February, at the peak of the primaries season, Sanders supporters here too appear more focused on progressive issues, while Biden supporters are largely focused on criticism or rejection of Trump.The basic asymmetric and polarized structure of American political media has changed little over the past several years, and this time period is no exception. The potent role of conservative media in the election victory of Trump in 2016 rested on two distinct factors: first, Trumps success in securing favorable coverage and strong support in conservative media, and second, the success that conservative media had in influencing media coverage outside of conservative media. The willingness of conservative media and audiences to defend and support Trump is clearly evident during these months. Trump continued to receive strong support in conservative media, which acted to divert, deflect, and reframe negative coverage, despite the rash of negative coverage criticizing the administrations response to the pandemic. The evidence also points to a further isolation of conservative media in American political discourse and a system less able to shape discourse and coverage outside of its own confines, leaving Americans in more starkly divided pistemic worlds. The administration-friendly narratives about the pandemic and Obamagate got little to no traction outside of conservative media. This finding matches what we found in a prior report in which we describe the inability of conservative media to shape coverage of the Hunter Biden scandal outside of right-wing media during January and February 2020, a pattern that is repeated in October 2020.Neither President Trump nor conservative media have lost their ability to influence the media agenda. For example, in a recent report we describe how Trump was able to create a controversy about mail-in voter fraud that prompted media coverage across the political spectrum. The sexual harassment allegations lodged by Tara Reade against Joe Biden ultimately got a public airingsomething conservative media pushed hard on. Despite the fact that the impetus to address this topic came also from the left, the media attention garnered in conservative media was not matched in the center and left. The key difference is that while President Trump and conservative media can still make news, their power to interpret and frame the narrative around key events beyond conservative media is more constrained than in 2016. The asymmetric credibility gap between conservative media and the rest of the media ecosystem appears to have deepened. And professional media seem to succumb less readily to the bias of balance problem that had bedeviled much of mainstream coverage of Hillary Clintons campaign in 2016.There is plentiful evidence of disinformation in political discourse among partisan media and on social media. The problem is far more acute on the right than the left and considerable attention on the far right is tied to the growing QAnon conspiracy. This development is a troubling symptom of the state of political discourse in the United States and translates into real-world costs. However, the impact of top-down propaganda and disinformation is still a greater problem in the United States, particularly so in relation to Covid-19, as tens of millions of Americans have taken unnecessary risks and helped spread the pandemic because they were misinformed about the dangers of contracting the disease and the value of measures deemed effective by public health authorities in reducing the chance of infection, such as social distancing or mask wearing. Many people, including public health specialists and the general public, have come to the conclusion that compared to the relative successes of other countries in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States response has been a failure, costing innumerable lives and leaving tens of thousands with long-term health problems, while deepening and extending the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. A large minority of Americans fundamentally disagree with this assessment. These divergent worldviews, the symptom of a larger epistemic crisis in the United States tied to asymmetrically polarized media systems, greatly complicate efforts to effectively meet such collection action challenges, and undermine democratic governance. In this paper, we describe how American media ecosystems are able to sustain such different worldviews and contribute to the mishandling and miscommunication of the pandemic. This report is the second in a series of reports that cover the months running up to the November election.","output":"Polarization and the Pandemic: American Political Discourse, March C May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As rates of new COVID-19 cases decline across Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing policies and lockdown measures, countries require guidance on how to ease restrictions while minimizing the risk of resurgent outbreaks.

We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely.

The aim of this study was to explore the quality of the online education in China for international medical and nursing students from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as well as the factors that influenced their satisfaction with online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Questionnaires were developed and administered to 316 international medical and nursing students and 120 teachers at a university in China. The Chi-square test was used to detect the influence of participants' personal characteristics on their satisfaction with online education. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test was employed to identify the negative and positive factors influencing the online education satisfaction. A binary logistic regression model was performed for multiple-factor analysis to determine the association of the different categories of influential factors-crisis-, learner-, instructor-, and course-related categories, with the online education satisfaction. RESULTS: Overall, 230 students (response rate 72.8%) and 95 teachers (response rate 79.2%) completed the survey. It was found that 36.5% of students and 61.1% of teachers were satisfied with the online education. Teachers' professional title, students' year of study, continent of origin and location of current residence significantly influenced the online education satisfaction. The most influential barrier for students was the severity of the COVID-19 situation and for teachers it was the sense of distance. The most influential facilitating factor for students was a well-accomplished course assignment and for teachers it was the successful administration of the online courses. CONCLUSIONS: Several key factors have been identified that affected the attitudes of international health science students from LMICs and their teachers towards online education in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve the online education outcome, medical schools are advised to promote the facilitating factors and cope with the barriers, by providing support for students and teaching faculties to deal with the anxiety caused by the pandemic, caring for the state of mind of in-China students away from home, maintaining the engagement of out-China students studying from afar and enhancing collaborations with overseas institutions to create practice opportunities at students' local places.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to online medical and nursing education during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from international students from low- and middle-income countries and their teaching staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide-ranging literature has explored the relationship between research, knowledge and policy However, legislatures have often been overlooked in this research While some studies have looked at ?who has access?, the literature on how parliaments seek to engage with knowledge claims is particularly scarce This article addresses this gap through a case study of UK select committees By adopting an interpretive lens, the article explores how MPs and officials make sense of evidence in committee settings It finds that legalistic definitions around ?evidence? shape wider beliefs in how to engage with knowledge claims and the practices of undertaking inquiries, and are underpinned by a distinctly political function of knowledge use in politics Beliefs around evidence have significant repercussions and highlight tensions (i) around the authority of committee reports, (ii) between epistemic and democratic claims, and (iii) with respect to who is included and excluded This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"The Webs of Belief around Evidence in Legislatures: The case of select committees in the UK House of Commons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycosylation is a ubiquitous co- and post-translational modification involved in the sorting, folding, and trafficking of proteins in biological systems; in humans, >50% of gene products are glycosylated with the cellular machinery of glycosylation compromising ~2% of the genome.

We used artificially contaminated samples to compare the membrane filter washing procedure against direct plating of membrane filters on culture media in relation to M.chimaera and M.chelonae recovery efficiency. Moreover, we compared the efficacy of NTM Elite agar in inhibiting the growth of aquatic bacteria with that of cetylpyridinium chloride and N-acetyl-L-cysteine sodium hydroxide decontamination treatments. The washing procedure yielded a low release of both mycobacterium strains (6.6% for Mycobacterium chimaera and 7.5% for Mycobacterium chelonae) from the membrane filters; on the contrary, direct plating of membrane filters led to a 100% cell recovery. Water sample pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine sodium hydroxide (1%), despite achieving complete suppression of non-acid fast bacilli, caused a reduction in mycobacteria growth.

The most important reasons are multidrug-resistant pathogens, the rapid spread of emerging diseases aggravated by globalization, and the extended reach of tropical and vector-borne diseases resulting from continued climate change. Given the increase in these diseases and the limited effectiveness of antibiotics, traditional knowledge can constitute a useful tool to address these new health challenges.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine worldwide trends of four emotionsfear, anger, sadness, and joyand the narratives underlying those emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 to April 9, 2020, were collected using wuhan, corona, nCov, and covid as search keywords. RESULTS: Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members, while topics related to joy included words of gratitude and good health.

The steady rise of societal concerns indicated by negative emotions needs to be monitored and controlled by complementing regular crisis communication with strategic public health communication that aims to balance public psychological wellbeing.","output":"Global Sentiments Surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: Analysis of Twitter Trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annually, millions of Muslims embark on a religious pilgrimage called the Hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The mass migration during the Hajj is unparalleled in scale, and pilgrims face numerous health hazards. The extreme congestion of people and vehicles during this time amplifies health risks, such as those from infectious diseases, that vary each year. Since the Hajj is dictated by the lunar calendar, which is shorter than the Gregorian calendar, it presents public-health policy planners with a moving target, demanding constant preparedness. We review the communicable and non-communicable hazards that pilgrims face. With the rise in global travel, preventing disease transmission has become paramount to avoid the spread of infectious diseases, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), avian influenza, and haemorrhagic fever. We examine the response of clinicians, the Saudi Ministry of Health, and Hajj authorities to these unique problems, and list health recommendations for prospective pilgrims.","output":"Health risks at the Hajj"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses assemble their replication complexes in infected cells from a multi-domain replication polyprotein. This polyprotein usually contains at least one protease whose primary function is to process the polyprotein into mature proteins. Such proteases also may have other functions in the replication cycle. For instance, cysteine proteases (PRO) frequently double up as ubiquitin hydrolases (DUB), thus interfering with cellular processes critical for virus replication. We previously reported the crystal structures of such a PRO/DUB from Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and of its complex with one of its PRO substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of TYMV PRO/DUB in complex with ubiquitin. We find that PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitin in an unorthodox way: It interacts with the body of ubiquitin through a split recognition motif engaging both the major and the secondary recognition patches of ubiquitin (Ile44 patch and Ile36 patch, respectively, including Leu8 which is part of the two patches). However, the contacts are suboptimal on both sides. Introducing a single point mutation in TYMV PRO/DUB aimed at improving Ub-binding led to a much more active DUB. Comparison with other PRO/DUBs from other viral families, particularly coronaviruses, suggests that low DUB activities of viral PRO/DUBs may generally be fine-tuned features of interaction with host factors.","output":"Turnip yellow mosaic virus protease binds ubiquitin suboptimally to fine-tune its deubiquitinase activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study explores work motivation of autistic adults through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Twelve autistic employees (ages 28C47; 3 females) participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews about their work experience.

This is well exemplified by several recent epidemics such as those of Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian flu, Ebola, Monkeypox, and Hantaviruses. After the initial interspecies transmission per se, the viruses can disseminate into the human population through various and distinct mechanisms. Some of them are well characterized and understood, thus allowing a certain level of risk control and prevention. Surprisingly and in contrast, the initial steps that lead to the emergence of several viruses, and of their associated diseases, remain still poorly understood. Epidemiological field studies conducted in certain specific high-risk populations are thus necessary to obtain new insights into the early events of this emergence process. Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic and physiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within these new species. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century. The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host. In this review, after an introduction on emerging viruses, we will briefly present the results of a large epidemiological study performed in groups of Bantus and Pygmies living in villages and settlements located in the rain forest of the South region of Cameroon. These populations are living nearby the habitats of several monkeys and apes, often naturally infected by different retroviruses including SIV, STLV and simian foamy virus. Most of the persons included in this study were hunters of such NHPs, thus at high risk of contact with infected body fluids (blood, saliva,...) during hunting activities. After reviewing the current available data on the discovery, cross-species transmission from monkeys and apes to humans of the simian foamy retroviruses, we will report the results of our study. Such infection is a unique natural model to study the different mechanisms of restriction of retroviral emergence in Humans.","output":"Mcanismes dmergence virale et transmission interespces : lexemple des rtrovirus Foamy simiens chezlHomme en Afrique Centrale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mojiang virus (MojV) is the first henipavirus identified in a rodent and known only by sequence data, whereas all other henipaviruses have been isolated from bats (Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Cedar virus) or discovered by sequence data from material of bat origin (Ghana virus). Ephrin-B2 and -B3 are entry receptors for Hendra and Nipah viruses, but Cedar virus can utilize human ephrin-B1, -B2, -A2 and -A5 and mouse ephrin-A1. However, the entry receptor for MojV remains unknown, and its species tropism is not well characterized. Here, we utilized recombinant full-length and soluble forms of the MojV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins in membrane fusion and receptor tropism studies. MojV F and G were functionally competent and mediated cellCcell fusion in primate and rattine cells, albeit with low levels and slow fusion kinetics. Although a relative instability of the pre-fusion conformation of a soluble form of MojV F was observed, MojV F displayed significantly greater fusion activity when heterotypically paired with Ghana virus G. An exhaustive investigation of A- and B-class ephrins indicated that none serve as a primary receptor for MojV.

Widely-used applications of blockchain include digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This paper proposes an algorithmic approach to analyze the efficiency of a blockchain as a function of the number of blocks and the average synchronization delay. The proposed algorithms consider a random network model that characterizes the growth of a tree of blocks by adhering to a standard protocol. The model is parametric on two probability distribution functions governing block production and communication delay. Both distributions determine the synchronization efficiency of the distributed copies of the blockchain among the so- called workers and, therefore, are key for capturing the overall stochastic growth. Moreover, the algorithms consider scenarios with a fixed or an unbounded number of workers in the network. The main result illustrates how the algorithms can be used to evaluate different types of blockchain designs, e.g., systems in which the average time of block production can match the average time of message broadcasting required for synchronization. In particular, this algorithmic approach provides insight into efficiency criteria for identifying conditions under which increasing block production has a negative impact on the stability of a blockchain. The model and algorithms are agnostic of the blockchains final use, and they serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing a variety of non-functional properties of current and future blockchains.","output":"Algorithmic Analysis of Blockchain Efficiency with Communication Delay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: E-prescribing is the most important achievement in the automation of the healthcare sector in Poland.

Therefore, it is useful to identify the factors that have an impact on doctors acceptance levels for the new technology. Methods: This study employs a survey based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) method. Our questionnaire was completed by 144 family doctors in Poland during the technology implementation phase and the initial period of obligatory e-prescribing, between 1 December 2019 and 1 March 2020. Results: The results of the survey indicate that doctors do not believe that e-prescribing improves the effectiveness of their work. In addition, this attitude does not depend on the age of the respondent. We also found, regarding the influence of societal attitudes, that doctors only rarely consider the opinions of others in relation to their job. Conclusions: The implementation of new technologies in the healthcare system must be accompanied by consideration of how user-friendly the technologies are, and whether the users will have appropriate technical and financial support.","output":"Doctors Perceptions of E-Prescribing upon Its Mandatory Adoption in Poland, Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter offers some reflections promoting cosmopolitanism and sustainable development through systematic reflexivity in research and education.

Seurat clustering and gene expression pathway analysis identified two major subpopulations in the lung microvascular endothelium, a subpopulation enriched for expression of immune response genes such as major histocompatibility complex genes (immuneEC) and another defined by increased expression of vascular development genes such as Sox17 (devEC). The presence of immuneEC and devEC subpopulations was also observed in non-human primate lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 and murine lungs infected with H1N1 influenza virus. Following the peak of inflammatory injury, we observed the emergence of a proliferative lung EC subpopulation. Overexpression of Sox17 prevented inflammatory activation in ECs. Thus, there appears to be a\\" division of labor\\" within the lung microvascular endothelium with some ECs showing propensity for inflammatory signaling and others for endothelial regeneration.

With the rising prevalence of obesity in the UK, there is a need to develop obesity care competencies that apply to healthcare professionals (HCPs) at all levels of the health service, to increase the capacity for contemporary, evidence-based treatment that is effective, compassionate, and avoids stigmatising patients. METHODS: A UK Obesity Care Competencies Working Group consisting of experts by profession and experts by experience was created to provide a framework of obesity care competencies for HCPs involved in specialist obesity care (tiers 2C4 in the UK). The framework was adapted from a set of competencies recently published by the USA-based Obesity Medicine Education Collaborative (OMEC) and was intended to be adaptable to nurses and allied health professionals, as well as physicians, owing to the multidisciplinary team approach used in healthcare in the UK. RESULTS: The UK Obesity Care Competencies Working Group developed a set of 29 competencies, divided into five focal areas, namely obesity knowledge, patient care and procedural skills, practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism and interpersonal communication skills, and systems-based practice. The working group recommends that the obesity care competencies are targeted at HCPs training as specialists. The competencies could be imported into existing training programmes to help standardise obesity-related medical education and could also be used to direct a new General Practitioner with Extended Role (GPwER) qualification. CONCLUSION: This list of obesity care competencies aims to provide an initial framework to improve education for HCPs and therefore to improve patient care in obesity. The acceptance and integration of these competencies into the healthcare system should provide a stepping stone toward addressing trends in health inequality.","output":"Recommendations from a Working Group on Obesity Care Competencies for Healthcare Education in the UK: A Report by the Steering Committee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic dramatically affected the provision of healthcare in the U.S. with sharp declines in routine and elective healthcare services. Outpatient clinic visits declined nearly 60% in the early pandemic. We investigated how COVID-19 impacted the provision of OPAT at various Infectious Disease (ID) POICs nationwide. METHODS: Patient (pt) records were evaluated from Jan 2019 C July 2019 and compared to Jan 2020 C July 2020. Data collected included new OPAT pts, demographics, infection type, location prior to OPAT and therapy characteristics. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test with p< 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fourteen POICs reported data with a total of 2410 new OPAT pts in 2019 and 1807 in 2020, representing a decrease of 25%. Table 1 shows the comparison of OPAT characteristics between 2019 and 2020. Mean age and gender were similar, but there was a significantly higher percentage of pts 65 years treated in 2020 (43% vs. 36%, p< 0.001). Infection type and location prior to OPAT were consistent between 2019 and 2020. Primary antimicrobial use was comparable with the exception of cefepime, which showed a greater use in 2020 (14% vs. 11%, p=0.006). OPAT management differed significantly from 2019 to 2020 with fewer pts completing therapy as prescribed in 2020 (85.9% vs. 88.3%, p=0.021), driven largely by more early discontinuations and switches to oral therapy. Other reasons for those not completing therapy were also significant and due primarily to transfer of care to other settings, most commonly the home (1.9% vs. 2.9%, p=0.029). Overall length of therapy was comparable. Table 1. Comparison of OPAT in 2019 (Pre-COVID) and 2020 (Post-COVID) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: OPAT provided through ID POICs experienced a substantial decrease in pts treated during the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. This was expected with the decline in healthcare services, especially elective procedures. Most pt and treatment characteristics were comparable between years, but interestingly, more elderly received OPAT during the pandemic and fewer completed therapy as planned. Further analysis of these differences can help determine effects of the pandemic on overall health outcomes in the OPAT population. DISCLOSURES: Lucinda J. Van Anglen, PharmD, Merck & Co.

HRQoL was estimated using EuroQol 5-Dimension-3 Level Questionnaire at hospitalisation, 30 days, and 6 and 12 months following hospital discharge. The association of cardiac rehabilitation and self-reported physical activity on temporal changes in HRQoL was quantified using inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score and multilevel regression analyses. RESULTS: Cardiac rehabilitation attendees had higher HRQoL scores than non-attendees at 30 days (mean EuroQol 5-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) scores: 71.0 (SD 16.8) vs 68.6 (SD 19.8)), 6 months (76.0 (SD 16.4) vs 70.2 (SD 19.0)) and 12 months (76.9 (SD 16.8) vs 70.4 (SD 20.4)).

Standard steady state RANS turbulence models provide a reasonable prediction, despite some well-known limitations in reproducing the turbulent mixing in highly unsteady flows. Their affordable cost is ideal in the preliminary design steps, whereas, in the detailed phase of the design process, turbulence scale-resolving methods (such as LES or similar approaches) can be preferred to significantly improve the accuracy. Despite that, in dealing with multi-physics and multi-scale problems, as for Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) in presence of radiation, transient approaches are not always affordable and appropriate numerical treatments are necessary to properly account for the huge range of characteristics scales in space and time that occur when turbulence is resolved and heat conduction is simulated contextually. The present work describes an innovative methodology to perform CHT simulations accounting for multi-physics and multi-scale problems. Such methodology, named U-THERM3D, is applied for the metal temperature prediction of an annular aeroengine lean burn combustor. The theoretical formulations of the tool are described, together with its numerical implementation in the commercial CFD code ANSYS Fluent. The proposed approach is based on a time de-synchronization of the involved time dependent physics permitting to significantly speed up the calculation with respect to fully coupled strategy, preserving at the same time the effect of unsteady heat transfer on the final time averaged predicted metal temperature. The results of some preliminary assessment tests of its consistency and accuracy are reported before showing its exploitation on the real combustor.

As a result there has been increasing interest amongst policy makers, national governing bodies (NGB), county sports partnerships (CPS) and the sport and physical activity sector more broadly, in understanding how best to reduce inequalities and widen participation. The price point of offers and whether a free offer enables or devalues participation, has been a key area of interest. This scoping review aimed to explore this topic further by investigating whether a free offer devalues or widens sport and physical activity participation amongst children and young adults aged 0-25?. METHODS: This scoping review searched three electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus) using a structured search strategy to identify articles published between 2017 and January 2022. Studies were included using the PICO criteria of; Population: children and young adults aged 0-25; Intervention: free offer relating to physical activity; Context: areas of deprivation in the UK; Outcome: engagement, involvement, participation in sport and physical activity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Five studies were eligible after screening 1301 titles and reviewing 14 full-text studies. Features reported included intervention design, outcomes, potential challenges and wider implications / future recommendations. Specifically, a narrative synthesis of the key themes of participation deprivation and cost effectiveness were outlined in more detail. A subsidized cost or free offer can improve participation generally and in attracting those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. However, the impact of such initiatives decrease with increasing deprivation highlighting that groups with the highest levels of deprivation have wider complexities affecting their participation. Competing priorities and potentially unrealistic expectations at stakeholders level was also identified. CONCLUSION: Despite the paucity of current research exploring the impact of a free offer in children and young adults, recommendations for future research, practice and policy included the need for longitudinal, more holistic and participant centric approaches. Further research is required to explore the impact of a free offer from an individual, societal and policy-level perspective, in widening and increasing participation in sport and physical activity.","output":"A Scoping Review Exploring Whether a Free Offer Devalues or Widens Sport and Physical Activity Participation Amongst Children and Young Adults Aged 0C25?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is considered as the most significant global public health crisis of the century.

However, there is only limited information regarding the safety profiles of the proposed drugs, in particular drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity and cardiotoxicity of remdesivir using cardiomyocytes-derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) as an alternative source of human primary cardiomyocytes (CMs). In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. To gain further insight into the drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA). As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma concentration.

This study reports a COVID19 Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identification and mapping of vulnerable counties in the United States. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning based COVID19 vulnerability model using CDC sociodemographic and COVID19-specific themes. An innovative COVID19 Impact Assessment algorithm was also developed using homogeneity and trend assessment technique for evaluating severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class, 24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low. Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.

In order for remote PROMs to be widely used by mobile apps, the results should not be different depending on the location; that is, remote PROM results performed in locations other than hospitals should be able to obtain reliable results equivalent to those performed in hospitals, and this is very important. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have assessed the reliability of PROMs using mobile apps according to the location by comparing the results performed remotely from the hospital and performed at the outpatient visits. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of remote PROMs using mobile apps compared to PROMs performed during outpatient follow-up visits after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. METHODS: A total of 174 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair completed questionnaires 2 days before visiting the clinic for the 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (test A). The patients completed the questionnaires at the clinic (test B) using the same mobile app and device for the 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.

The rate of completion of tests A and B using the mobile app was significantly lower in the group older than 70 years than in the other groups for all postoperative periods (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: PROMs using mobile apps with different locations differed soon after surgery but were reliably similar after 6 months. The remote PROMs using mobile apps could be used reliably for the patient more than 6 months after surgery. However, it is to be expected that the use of mobile appCbased questionnaires is not as useful in the group older than 70 years as in other age groups.","output":"The Reliability of Remote Patient-Reported Outcome Measures via Mobile Apps to Replace Outpatient Visits After Rotator Cuff Repair Surgery: Repetitive Test-Retest Comparison Study for 1-Year Follow-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundNational data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and knowledge on associated risk factors are important for understanding the course of the pandemic. \\"Testing Denmark\\" is a national large-scale epidemiological surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danish population. MethodsBetween September and October 2020, approximately 1.3 million of 5.8 million Danish citizens (age > 15 years) were randomly invited to fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposures and symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined by Point-of Care rapid Test (POCT) distributed to participants home addresses. FindingsIn total 318,552 participants (24.5% invitees) completed the questionnaire and provided the result of the POCT. Of these, 2,519 (0.79%) were seropositive (median age 55 years) and women were more often seropositive than men, interquartile range (IQR) 42-64, 40.2% males. Of participants with a prior positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (n=1,828), 29.1% were seropositive in the POCT. Seropositivity increased with age irrespective of sex. Elderly participants (>61 years) reported less symptoms and had less frequently been tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger participants. Seropositivity was associated with physical contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Risk ratio (RR) 7.43, 95% CI: 6.57-8.41) and in particular household members (RR 17.70, 95% CI: 15.60-20.10). Home care workers had a higher risk of seropositivity (RR 2.09 (95% CI: 1.58-2.78) as compared to office workers. Geographic population density was not associated to seropositivity. A high degree of compliance with national preventive recommendations was reported (e.g., > 80% use of face masks), but no difference was found between seropositive and seronegative participants. InterpretationThis study provides insight into the immunity of the Danish population seven to eight months after the first COVID-19 case in Denmark. The seroprevalence was lower than expected probably due to a low sensitivity of the POCT used or due to challenges relating to the reading of test results. Occupation or exposure in local communities were major routes of infection. As elderly participants were more often seropositive despite fewer symptoms and less PCR tests performed, more emphasis should be placed on testing this age group.","output":"Testing Denmark: A Danish nationwide surveillance study of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore how the Riau Provincial Government manages unexpected expenses in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main complication of COVID-19 is rapid respirational deterioration, which may cause life-threatening pneumonia conditions. Global healthcare systems are currently facing a scarcity of resources to assist critical patients simultaneously. Indeed, non-critical patients are mostly advised to self-isolate or quarantine themselves at home. However, there are limited healthcare services available during self-isolation at home. According to research, nearly 20C30% of COVID patients require hospitalization, while almost 5C12% of patients may require intensive care due to severe health conditions. This pandemic requires global healthcare systems that are intelligent, secure, and reliable. Tremendous efforts have been made already to develop non-contact sensing technologies for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most significant early indication of COVID-19 is rapid and abnormal breathing. In this research work, RF-based technology is used to collect real-time breathing abnormalities data. Subsequently, based on this data, a large dataset of simulated breathing abnormalities is generated using the curve fitting technique for developing a machine learning (ML) classification model. The advantages of generating simulated breathing abnormalities data are two-fold; it will help counter the daunting and time-consuming task of real-time data collection and improve the ML model accuracy. Several ML algorithms are exploited to classify eight breathing abnormalities: eupnea, bradypnea, tachypnea, Biot, sighing, Kussmaul, CheyneCStokes, and central sleep apnea (CSA). The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated based on accuracy, prediction speed, and training time for real-time breathing data and simulated breathing data. The results show that the proposed platform for real-time data classifies breathing patterns with a maximum accuracy of 97.5%, whereas by introducing simulated breathing data, the accuracy increases up to 99.3%.

However, the precise and relative roles of the two proteins in BCV infectivity remain elusive. To unequivocally determine their roles in viral cytopathogenicity, we developed a system in which phenotypically chimeric viruses were generated by infecting a closely related mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells that stably express an individual BCV protein (S or HE). The chimeric viruses were then used to infect human rectal tumor (HRT)-18 cells that are permissive to BCV but are nonsusceptible to MHV. Using this approach, we found that the chimeric virus containing the BCV S protein on the virion surface entered and replicated in HRT-18 cells; this was specifically blocked by prior treatment of the virus with a neutralizing antibody specific to the BCV S protein, indicating that the BCV S protein is responsible for initiating chimeric virus infection. In contrast, chimeric viruses that contain biologically active and functional BCV HE protein on the surface failed to enter HRT-18 cells, indicating that the BCV HE protein alone is not sufficient for BCV infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the S protein but not the HE protein of BCV is necessary and sufficient for infection of the chimeric viruses in HRT-18 cells, suggesting that BCV likely uses the S protein as a primary vehicle to infect permissive cells.","output":"The Spike but Not the Hemagglutinin/Esterase Protein of Bovine Coronavirus Is Necessary and Sufficient for Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The width of a human hair sourced from a female elementary school student was measured by light diffraction using red and blue laser pointers.

The molar absorptivity () of the complex was 3.33  10(3) L mol(?1) cm(?1) and its band gap energy was 1.91 eV. The stoichiometric ratio of REM:CLA was found to be 1:1. The association constant of the complex was 1.11  10(9) L mol(?1), and its standard free energy was 5.16  10(4) J mole(?1).

This is expensive in terms of lost jobs, lost economic productivity, and lost freedoms. So it is of interest to ask: What is the optimal intensity with which to lockdown, and how should that intensity vary dynamically over the course of an epidemic? This paper explores such questions with an optimal control model that recognizes the particular risks when infection rates surge beyond the healthcare systems capacity to deliver appropriate care. The analysis shows that four broad strategies emerge, ranging from brief lockdowns that only smooth the curve to sustained lockdowns that prevent infections from spiking beyond the healthcare systems capacity. Within this model, it can be optimal to have two separate periods of locking down, so returning to a lockdown after initial restrictions have been lifted is not necessarily a sign of failure. Relatively small changes in judgments about how to balance health and economic harms can alter dramatically which strategy prevails. Indeed, there are constellations of parameters for which two or even three of these distinct strategies can all perform equally well for the same set of initial conditions; these correspond to so-called triple Skiba points. The performance of trajectories can be highly nonlinear in the state variables, such that for various times [Formula: see text] , the optimal unemployment rate could be low, medium, or high, but not anywhere in between. These complex dynamics emerge naturally from modeling the COVID-19 epidemic and suggest a degree of humility in policy debates.

Pressure was maintained during one hour, followed by one hour of disinsufflation. At the end of this phase, all animals, still under anesthesia, were submitted to euthanasia by blood removal through the arterial catheter. The blood samples were collected in three phases: 1) post-catheterization; 2) after one hour of pneumoperitoneum, and 3) one hour after disinsufflation. The samples were sent to the laboratory for urea and creatinine measurements. Results: Increased creatinine in SHR rats after 1 h of pneumoperitoneum with 10 mmHg pressure, while Wistar rats remained at the normal basal level. Urea levels increased for both SHR and EPM-1 Wistar rats after 1 h of pneumoperitoneum with 10 mmHg pressure. During the pneumoperitoneum with 4 mmHg pressure, creatinine and urea remained at basal levels. Conclusion: The renal function of SHR rats may be transiently changed, as it happens with non-hypertensive rats submitted to a 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum.","output":"A fun??o renal de ratos espontaneamente hipertensos submetidos ao pneumoperit?nio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 21 and 23 are recently identified hormones regulating metabolism of glucose, lipid, phosphate and vitamin D.

We enrolled 5,000 participants from Taiwan Biobank for this GWAS. After excluding participants with diabetes mellitus and quality control, association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with log-transformed FGF21 and FGF23 serum concentrations adjusted for age, sex and principal components of ancestry were analyzed. A second model additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) and a third model additionally adjusted for BMI and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were used. A total of 4,201 participants underwent GWAS analysis. rs67327215, located within RGS6 (a gene involved in fatty acid synthesis), and two other SNPs (rs12565114 and rs9520257, located between PHC2-ZSCAN20 and ARGLU1-FAM155A respectively) showed suggestive associations with serum FGF21 level (P = 6.66  10-7, 6.00  10-7 and 6.11  10-7 respectively).

COVID-19 vac-cines have been developed at the fastest known pace yet;such a fast production has led to concerns among general population wor-ldwide about safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Specifically, patients affected by chronic illnesses, such as Celiac Disease (CeD), may have greater apprehension. The immune status of CeD patients has been studied in literature, however the actual risk of infections is not clear, depending on various factors such as suboptimal nutri-tional status. Information on vaccine hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the development of an efficient vaccine campaign. In our study, we aimed at evaluating COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among CeD patients, its reasons and determinants. Materials and methods: An anonymous validated questionnaire formulated on the EUSurvey web platform was sent to a mailing list of CeD patients followed at our Celiac Center of Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan. The questions focused on socio-demographic data, disease-related and lifestyle data, attitude to vaccinations in general and predisposition to the COVID-19 vaccine. Hesitancy was defined by a negative answer to the question Would You accept to get vaccinated tomorrow against COVID-19?. Among the hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine refusing patients were defined as those who answered negatively to the fol-lowing question: Would You eventually accept it in the future when more data is available?. We evaluated the reasons and the factors associated (determinants) to hesitancy, by calculating Adjusted Odds Ratio (AdjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The questionnaire was sent to 346 patients with a response rate of 29.8% (103). Among the respondents, 25.2% of patients were hesitant, with a total refusal rate of 4.8%. The main reason was the fear of adverse events (68.2%). Among the hesitant patients, 23% declared that their opinion was influenced by CeD.

Compelling evidence has shown that premature parental death is strongly associated with many mental health disorders in adulthood, but whether it increases the risk of loneliness remains unclear. In this large community-based study, we included 32,682 adult participants (20C93 years old) from Southwest China and used the three-item short version of University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale to identify participants with loneliness. A total of 1,975 participants reported loneliness, which resulted in a loneliness prevalence of 6.0% in Southwest China. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between early parental death and loneliness after adjusting for age, gender, education level, marital status, smoking and drinking status, living status, and chronic diseases. We found that early parental death was significantly associated with loneliness [odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03C1.42]. A Sensitivity analysis excluding those with mental health disorders (796 participants) yielded similar results (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06C1.49). We also found that being younger, single, divorced, or widowed, and more educated; living alone; and having chronic disorders were associated with loneliness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 fecal swabs were collected from clinically infected domestic dogs of 2-5 months of age, suspected to suffer from CPV infection, from Cairo and Giza Governorates. The samples were subjected to qualitative antigen detection using the rapid test, followed by isolation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, molecular characterization with partial amplification of VP2 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Out of 50 fecal samples, 20 samples were positive (40%) by Rapid CPV/canine coronavirus Ag Test Kit. These positive samples were cultured successfully on MDCK cells. Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277. Phylogenetic analysis of the Egyptian strains serotype 2b illustrated that they were closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers KP715709, KP715694, KP715701, and KP715700); while Egyptian strains serotype 2c was closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers MH711894 and MH711902), Taiwanese strain (KU244254), Chinese strain (MF467242), and Vietnamese strain (accession number LC216910).

Rapid transition to telemental health (TMH) allowed for the continued delivery of mental health care. Although several guidelines and best practices are available for the methodical development of a TMH service, there are few documented procedures on rapidly converting to fully virtualized services. We discuss how two outpatient mental health clinics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus rapidly virtualized clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All current clinical appointments were converted to virtual, and all new clinical intakes were scheduled as virtual visits starting March 16, 2020. Virtualization included a modified needs assessment, updated clinic procedures, focused patient and staff training on TMH, and increased frequency of team meetings. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of clinic log and electronic health record data to examine the number of appointments and no-shows before and after COVID-19 virtualization. Results: Virtualization was operational within two business days. Scheduled appointments decreased 10.6% immediately postvirtualization, followed by an increase of 17.8% across the 6 months postvirtualization. No-show rates dropped from 11.9% pre- to 6.8% postvirtualization, leading to a 26.2% increase in completed visits. Discussion: Rapid virtualization of mental health services can occur effectively. Wider use and acceptance of TMH, especially to patient-homes, is likely in the foreseeable future as health care providers and systems reconceptualize service delivery.

The issue of procyclicality has returned to the forefront of policy discussions due to the significant increases in margins because of market turmoil related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we re-visit the procyclicality issue in risk-based margin models. Most of the existing pro-cyclicality mitigations focus on imposing a buffer or floor on the initial margin to avoid inadequately low margins during quiet periods. However, a more efficient anti-procyclicality mechanism should be able to provide relatively stable and adequate margins across different market conditions in a dynamic way, especially during stress periods. To address this issue, we develop a simple technique that explicitly pro-vides a smooth transition of the key risk drivers in risk-based margin models across different market conditions. Specifically, we use a dynamic scaling factor to control procyclicality. This dynamic scaling factor scales up the key risk drivers during quiet periods to avoid inadequately low risk coverage and tempers down their ele-vated levels during stress periods.

Methods: A survey was done using an electronic questionnaire administered regarding the change of patterns of acute coronary syndromes during the COVID through Google Forms with responses collected in excel format. Results: Among 256 cardiologists contacted, 101 responded to the survey. Among cardiologists who responded, all were interventional cardiologists- with most of them performing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (95%) regularly during pre-COVID times. Most of them have noticed a significant reduction in the number of patients with ACS seeking health care (94%) and another 61% of respondents felt that there was a reduction in the number of patients with acute coronary syndrome. There was a significant delay in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction presentation to the hospital (88%) and significant reduction in the number of primary PCI (47%).

However, the full bacterial communities that contaminate in-use stethoscopes have not been investigated. METHODS We used bacterial 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing, analysis, and quantification to profile entire bacterial populations on stethoscopes in use in an intensive care unit (ICU), including practitioner stethoscopes, individual-use patient-room stethoscopes, and clean unused individual-use stethoscopes. Two additional sets of practitioner stethoscopes were sampled before and after cleaning using standardized or practitioner-preferred methods. RESULTS Bacterial contamination levels were highest on practitioner stethoscopes, followed by patient-room stethoscopes, whereas clean stethoscopes were indistinguishable from background controls. Bacterial communities on stethoscopes were complex, and community analysis by weighted UniFrac showed that physician and patient-room stethoscopes were indistinguishable and significantly different from clean stethoscopes and background controls. Genera relevant to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were common on practitioner stethoscopes, among which Staphylococcus was ubiquitous and had the highest relative abundance (6.8%-14% of contaminating bacterial sequences). Other HAI-related genera were also widespread although lower in abundance. Cleaning of practitioner stethoscopes resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial contamination levels, but these levels reached those of clean stethoscopes in only a few cases with either standardized or practitioner-preferred methods, and bacterial community composition did not significantly change.

The simulations reveal that variation of area, aspect ratio and orientation of rectangular nanohole can significantly affect the tensile strength of defective graphene. For example, defective graphene with a larger area of rectangular nanohole shows a bigger drop in tensile strength. It was found that the tensile strength of both armchair and zigzag edged graphene monotonically decreases with area increases in rectangular nanohole. Changes in aspect ratio and orientation of rectangular nanohole, however, can either decrease or increase the tensile strength of defective graphene, dependent on the tensile direction. This study also presents information that the tensile strength of defective graphene with large area of nanohole is more sensitive to changes in aspect ratio and orientation than is defective graphene with small area of nanohole.

The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets.

STUDY DESIGN: Oro-nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples were collected from all patients simultaneously in the early stage of COVID-19. Viral loads were determined by extracting viral RNAs from saliva samples of patients whose ONP swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The demographic information, comorbidities, cycle threshold values, and one-month clinical courses were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The patients' clinical course was evaluated for one month; 56 % of patients had mild disease, 26.4 % had moderate disease, 9.6 % had severe disease, and 8% had a critical/mortal disease. The average cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and ONP samples were measured as 22.28 and 24.19, respectively. Cycle threshold value of saliva was found to be significant in predicting disease severity (Eta coefficient 0.979). A statistically significant relationship was found between the disease's severity and the mean of ONP samples' Ct-values (p < 0.05). Gender, age, body mass index, and co-morbidities were compared with the severity of the disease; no statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION: Viral load detected in saliva in the early period of COVID-19 infection may have a prognostic value in showing the disease's course in patients over 45-year-old.

When threatened by suboptimal habitat conditions, these creatures enter a suspended animation-like state called cryptobiosis, in which metabolism is diminished, similar to hibernation. In this state, tardigrades benefit from enhanced extremotolerance, withstanding dehydration efficiently for years at a time in a type of cryptobiosis called anhydrobiosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tardigrade proteome is at the heart of cryptobiosis. Principally, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are known to help protect cell function in the absence of water. Importantly, TDPs have been successfully expressed in cells of other species experimentally, even protecting human tissue against stress in vitro. However, previous work has failed to address how to strategically identify TDPs in the tardigrade proteome holistically. The overarching purpose of this current study, consequently, was to generate a list of IDPs/TDPs associated with tardigrade cryptobiosis that are high-priority for further investigation. Firstly, a novel database containing 44,836 tardigrade proteins from 338 different species was constructed to consolidate and standardize publicly available data. Secondly, a support vector machine (SVM) was created to sort the newly constructed database entries on the binary basis of disorder (i.e., IDP versus non-IDP). Features of this model draw from disorder metrics and literature curation, correctly classifying 160 of the 171 training set proteins (~93.6%). Of the 5,415 putative IDPs/TDPs our SVM identified, we present 82 (30 having confident subclass prediction and 52 having experimental detection in previous studies). Subsequently, the role each protein might play in tardigrade resilience is discussed. By and large, this supervised machine learning classifier represents a promising new approach for identifying IDPs/TDPs, opening doors to harness the tardigrades remarkable faculties for biomaterial preservation, genetic engineering, astrobiological research, and ultimately, the benefit of humankind.","output":"Making sense of disorder: Investigating intrinsically disordered proteins in the tardigrade proteome via a computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and negative psychological effects among general population. However, university students are particularly vulnerable in terms of mental health. The present study evaluated the association between mental health, quality of sleep, aggression, and physical activity in university students in Mexico after 1 year of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, including a gender-sensitive analysis. Participants (935 university students) completed an online questionnaire which collected information regarding demographic data, psychological distress (IES-R scale), depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), aggressiveness Buss-Perry Aggressive Questionnaire, sleep quality (PSQI) and physical activity (IPAQ-S). Findings showed that female students showed significantly higher scores in psychological distress, anxiety, stress scores and sleep quality, as compared to male students. By contrast, male students showed significantly higher scores on aggressiveness than female students. In addition, on physical activity, females performed significantly higher MET-min/week on moderate and high levels. Finally, liner regression model accounted for approximately 73.5% of the variance in DASS-21 scores, with the body mass index, IES-R, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and IPAQ subscales, emerging as significant individual (positive) predictors. Therefore, the pandemic affected female and male students differently. Female students reported more psychological distress, anxiety, and stress while male students reported higher aggressiveness.

AIM: To investigate the experiences and attitudes of midwives who have provided pregnancy and childbirth care to women with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological study was carried out in two Spanish tertiary hospitals. Fourteen midwives were recruited by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews and analysed using Giorgi's descriptive method. FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: \\"challenges and differences when working in a pandemic\\", \\"emotional and mental health and wellbeing\\" and \\"women's emotional impact perceived by midwives\\". Midwives pointed to several factors tied to a safe, supportive and empowering work place: support from staff and managers, access to adequate personal protective equipment, and reliable guidelines. They also dealt with professional and personal challenges during the pandemic, showing feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, discomfort, lack of support, and knowledge. Finally, midwives expressed their concerns about the feelings of pregnant women with COVID-19, such as fear, anxiety, and loneliness.

Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals' interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. OBJECTIVE: Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social media-based regulation. METHODS: Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; ?=.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; ?=.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals' outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media-based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=-1.00; ?=-.80; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals' reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people's negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media-based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media-wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","output":"Social Media and Emotional Burnout Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multilevel Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This N = 173,426 social science dataset was collected through the collaborative COVIDiSTRESS Global Survey - an open science effort to improve understanding of the human experiences of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic between 30th March and 30th May, 2020.

STUDY DESIGN This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted for delivery from March 22 to April 18, 2020, at two New York City hospitals. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were collected. The relationship between COVID-19 and demographic, clinical, and maternal and neonatal outcome data was evaluated. Demographic data included the number of COVID-19 cases ascertained by ZIP code of residence. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to determine predictability of demographic risk factors for COVID-19. RESULTS Of 454 women delivered, 79 (17%) had COVID-19. Of those, 27.9% (n = 22) had symptoms such as cough (13.9%), fever (10.1%), chest pain (5.1%), and myalgia (5.1%). While women with COVID-19 were more likely to live in the ZIP codes quartile with the most cases (47 vs. 41%) and less likely to live in the ZIP code quartile with the fewest cases (6 vs. 14%), these comparisons were not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Women with COVID-19 were less likely to have a vaginal delivery (55.2 vs. 51.9%, p = 0.04) and had a significantly longer postpartum length of stay with cesarean (2.00 vs. 2.67days, p < 0.01).

DESIGN Descriptive analysis of laboratory-identified CDI reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network by Colorado and Tennessee ACH inpatient units in 2018. METHODS Threshold levels of 2, 3, and 4 CDI events per calendar month per unit (unit month) were assessed to identify units that would trigger facility reporting to public health. Values meeting thresholds were defined as alerts. Recurrent alerts were defined as alerts from units meeting the threshold 2 times within 12 months. The presence of alerts was compared to the number of excess infections to identify high-burden facilities. RESULTS At an alert threshold of 2 CDI events per unit month, 204 alerts occurred among 43 Colorado ACHs and 290 among 78 Tennessee ACHs. At a threshold of 3, there were 59 and 61 alerts, and at a threshold of 4, there were 17 and 10 alerts in Colorado and Tennessee, respectively. In both Colorado and Tennessee, at a threshold of 3 nearly 50% of alerts were recurrent, and facilities with at least one alert in 2018 accounted for 85% of the statewide excess infections. CONCLUSIONS An alert threshold of 3 CDI events per unit month is feasible for rapid identification of outbreaks in ACHs. This threshold can facilitate earlier assessments and interventions in high-burden facilities.","output":"Assessment of public health notification thresholds for Clostridioides difficile in acute-care hospitals-Colorado and Tennessee, 2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing upon broaden-and-build theory, this study examined the influence of positive leadership on employee engagement through the mediating role of employees state positive affect and the moderating effect of individualism-collectivism orientation in a Chinese cultural context.

During fertilization, spermatozoa share with the oocyte their epigenome, along with their haploid genome, in order to orchestrate embryo development. The epigenetic signature of spermatozoa is the result of a dynamic modulation of the epigenetic marks occurring, firstly, in the testis-during germ cell progression-then, along the epididymis, where spermatozoa still receive molecules, conveyed by epididymosomes. Paternal lifestyle, including nutrition and exposure to hazardous substances, alters the phenotype of the next generations, through the remodeling of a sperm epigenetic blueprint that dynamically reacts to a wide range of environmental and lifestyle stressors. With that in mind, this review will summarize and discuss insights into germline epigenetic plasticity caused by environmental stimuli and diet and how spermatozoa may be carriers of induced epimutations across generations through a mechanism known as paternal transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.","output":"Environmental Impact on Male (In)Fertility via Epigenetic Route"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: P-wave dispersion (PWD) is a noninvasive electrocardiographic (ECG) marker of atrial remodeling. Inflammations are likely to cause atrial remodeling. This study aims to determine the relationship between PWD and intrahospital mortality in Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: One hundred eighty-nine patients who tested positive for polymerase chain reaction for a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 were included in the cross-sectional study. PWD was calculated from the pre-treatment ECG of all patients at the time of hospitalization. Results: Mean PWD values were numerically and statistically significant in the group who died in hospital compared to the group discharged after recovery (46.3719.00 ms vs. 31.8611.08 ms, p<0.001). Regardless of gender, regression analysis found an independent relationship between PWD values and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, PWD values above 34 ms had 73% sensitivity and 69% specificity in predicting all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients (area under the curve: 0.737, confidence interval: 0.666-0.808, p<0.001).

The symptoms of COVID-19 vary from mild to severe among different age groups, but the physiological changes related to COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In the present study, a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based lipidomic strategy was used to characterize the endogenous plasma lipids for cured COVID-19 patients with different ages and symptoms. These patients were further divided into two groups: those with severe symptoms or who were elderly and relatively young patients with mild symptoms. In addition, automated lipidomic identification and alignment was conducted by LipidSearch software. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used for differential comparison. RESULTS: Nearly 500 lipid compounds were identified in each cured COVID-19 group through LipidSearch software. At the level of lipid subclasses, patients with severe symptoms or elderly patients displayed dramatic changes in plasma lipidomic alterations, such as increased triglycerides and decreased cholesteryl esters (ChE). Some of these differential lipids might also have essential biological functions. Furthermore, the differential analysis of plasma lipids among groups was performed to provide potential prognostic indicators, and the change in signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidemia was observed in cured COVID-19 patients due to the viral infection and medical treatment, and the discharged patients should continue to undergo consolidation therapy.

A total of 831 responses from nurses to open-ended questions were examined by using thematic analysis. The questions assessed potentially limited resources in the ICU, adequacy of staffing, and measures used to reduce the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to family members. RESULTS: Overarching themes concerned access to equipment and preventive measures taken to reduce exposure to the virus. These themes included \\"sheltering the patient when I don't have enough\\" and \\"protecting those I love when I am a vector of transmission.\\" Subthemes for the first overarching theme included not having enough personal protective equipment, not enough staff and not enough properly trained staff, and not enough institutional support. Subthemes for the second overarching theme included \\"isolating myself from everyone I care about\\" and \\"isolating everything I touch from everyone I care about.\\" CONCLUSIONS: This thematic analysis identified several concerns of ICU nurses related to caring for patients in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, little is known about how these symptoms are related to workplace and non-workplace impairment. OBJECTIVE: We examined if PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between treating patients with COVID-19 and functional impairment. METHODS: An online survey collected data regarding demographic and workplace variables, PTSD symptoms, functional impairment, distracted practice, and if the nurse treated patients with confirmed COVID-19. Data collected in November 2020 from 218 primarily White and female nurses were analyzed. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines in reporting the methods and results. RESULTS: Analyses involved two steps: (a) calculating descriptive statistics, conducting univariate tests, and examining correlations among study variables; and (b) conducting a path analysis examining the mediating role of PTSD symptoms in the relationship between treating patients with COVID-19 and functional outcomes. Univariate tests found that nurses who had a diploma/associate's/bachelor's and nurses who treated patients with COVID-19 reported more PTSD symptoms, functional impairment, and distracted practice compared to nurses with graduate degrees and those who did not treat patients with COVID-19. Compared to nurses who reported having access to adequate PPE, nurses who reported not having access to adequate PPE reported more PTSD symptoms but lower functional impairment and distracted practice. Men reported lower distracted practice scores than women. In step two of the analyses, the path model suggested that treating patients with COVID-19 was indirectly related to both distracted practice and functional impairment through PTSD symptoms.

However, lacking is a temperance in enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect bystander cells. Further, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi may underly the immunosuppressive effects of these two drugs. However, modern cell biology studies have shown clearly that de-acidification results in profound changes in the structure, function and cellular positioning of endolysosomes and Golgi, in signaling between these organelles and other subcellular organelles, and in fundamental cellular functions. Thus, studying the possible therapeutic effects of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 must occur concurrent with studies of the extent to which these drugs affect organellar and cell biology.

METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. FINDINGS: Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3-7). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5-11]) than the control group (12 days [8-15]; hazard ratio 437 [95% CI 186-1024], p=00010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study.

Purpose. the purpose of this paper was to identify the challenges that students in physical therapist (PT)/physical therapist assistant (PTA) programs in NY and NJ were experiencing and how institutions could respond to those challenges. Subjects. Students enrolled in a PTor PTA program in NY or NJ;N =934 (861 PT and 73 PTA). Methods. An online survey was distributed to PT/PTA programs in NY/NJ. the survey consisted of open-ended and closed-ended questions related to academic, financial, and nonacademic issues, transition to online learning, and how institutions could respond to student challenges. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used. Results. the most important challenges that students identified were quality/quantity of hands-on experiences, lack of contact with classmates, personal physical and mental health/wellness, and affording tuition and fees. Some differences were found across geographical regions and graduating cohorts. Physical therapist and PTA student cohorts had the same top concerns.

Its applicability is limited in some cases due to the additional risks associated with prolonged surgery, largely from the time-consuming staining procedure. Our work uses a measurable property of bulk tissue to bypass the staining process: as tumour cells proliferate, they influence the surrounding extra-cellular matrix, and the resulting change in elastic modulus provides a signature of the underlying pathology. In this work we accurately localise atomic force microscopy measurements of human liver tissue samples and train a generative adversarial network to infer elastic modulus from low-resolution images of unstained tissue sections. Pathology is predicted through unsupervised clustering of parameters characterizing the distributions of inferred values, achieving 89% accuracy for all samples based on the nominal assessment (n = 28), and 95% for samples that have been validated by two independent pathologists through post hoc staining (n = 20). Our results demonstrate that this technique could increase the feasibility of intraoperative frozen section analysis for use during resection surgery and improve patient outcomes.","output":"Stain-free identification of tissue pathology using a generative adversarial network to infer nanomechanical signatures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a Jetsons episode from 60 years ago, Elroy, the youngest Jetson, tries to get out of taking a space calculus test at school by telling his mom he's sick. \\"I think I have Venus Virus,\\" he says.

It is unclear how much opiates should be prescribed to ensure adequate analgesia at home without overprescription. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for requiring opiates following admission for tibial fractures and to estimate opiate requirements for children being discharged directly from the emergency department (ED). METHODS All children aged 4 to 16 years admitted with closed tibial fractures being treated in a molded circumferential above-knee plaster cast between October 2015 and April 2020 were included. Case notes were reviewed to identify demographics, analgesic prescriptions, and complications. Risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 75 children were included, of which 64% were males. The mean age was 9.5 (SD 3.4) years. Opiates were required by 36 (48%) children in the first 24 hours following admission. The median number of opiate doses in the first 48 hours was 0 (range: 0 to 5), with 93% of children receiving 3 doses. The odds of requiring opiates in the first 24 hours were unchanged for age above 10 years [odds ratio (OR)=0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33-2.23], male sex (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 0.59-4.19), high-energy injury (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 0.45-6.04), presence of a fibula fracture (OR=2.21, 95% CI: 0.72-6.76), or need for fracture reduction in the ED (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.20-1.65). No children developed compartment syndrome, and the mean length of stay was 1.4 (SD 1.2) days. No children were readmitted following discharge. CONCLUSIONS We have found no cases of compartment syndrome or extensive requirement for opiates following closed tibial fractures treated in plaster cast. These children are candidates to be discharged directly from the ED. We have not identified any specific risk factors for the targeting of opiate analgesics. We recommend a guideline prescription of 6 doses of opiates for direct discharge from the ED to ensure adequate analgesia without overprescription.

However, previous studies have not compared B-mode sonographic images (BSIs) and EBUS elastography images (EEIs) with final pathological diagnoses in radiologically normal-sized (computed tomography [CT]-negative) LNs. METHODS: Consecutive patients with CT-negative LNs, who received EBUS-TBNA, were retrospectively reviewed. Images of BSIs and EEIs of each LN were stored and independently evaluated. EEIs were assessed by calculating the stiffness area ratio (SAR, blue/overall areas). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to calculate the cutoff value for the SAR. Diagnostic test parameters were evaluated for each EBUS finding. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (149 LNs) were enrolled, and the median SAR of malignant LNs was significantly higher than that of benign LNs (0.58 vs. 0.32, P < 0.001). At the SAR cutoff of 0.41, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy rate (DAR) of elastography were 88.2%, 80.2%, 78.9%, 89.0%, and 83.9%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that elastography was the strongest predictor of malignancy (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.48-52.6; P < 0.001). The highest NPV (96.6%) was achieved with a combination of BSIs and EEIs. CONCLUSIONS: EBUS elastography predicted malignant LNs with a high DAR and NPV in CT-negative LNs. The NPV was highest when EEIs were combined with BSIs. Therefore, the combined evaluation of CT-negative LNs using EEIs and BSIs may help bronchoscopists perform EBUS-TBNA more efficiently. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Endobronchial ultrasound elastography accurately predicted malignancy with a high diagnostic accuracy rate and negative predictive value in radiologically normal-sized lymph nodes. The additional use of B-mode sonographic features resulted in a higher negative predictive value. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Endobronchial ultrasound elastography can guide the accurate collection of specimens with transbronchial needle aspiration, even in radiologically normal-sized lymph nodes. It can also readily distinguish benign and malignant lymph nodes, thus avoiding unnecessary punctures.","output":"Quantitative analysis of endobronchial ultrasound elastography in computed tomography-negative mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-resolving pancreatic islet inflammation is widely viewed as a contributor to decreases in -cell mass and function that occur in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating pathological inflammation would be useful to protect islet -cells. Herein, we described the use of 2,4-dihydroxy-4-methoxydihydrochalcone (DMC2), a bioactive molecule isolated from an ethanolic extract of Artemisia dracunculus L., as a novel anti-inflammatory agent. The ethanolic extract, termed PMI 5011, reduced IL-1-mediated NF-B activity. DMC2 retained this ability, indicating this compound as the likely source of anti-inflammatory activity within the overall PMI 5011 extract. We further examined NF-B activity using promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, Western blots, mRNA abundance, and protein secretion. Specifically, we found that PMI 5011 and DMC2 each reduced the ability of IL-1 to promote increases in the expression of the Ccl2 and Ccl20 genes. These genes encode proteins that promote immune cell recruitment and are secreted by -cells in response to IL-1. Phosphorylation of IB and the p65 subunit of NF-B were not reduced by either PMI 5011 or DMC2; however, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was blunted in the presence of DMC2. Finally, we observed that while PMI 5011 impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insulin output was preserved in the presence of DMC2. In conclusion, PMI 5011 and DMC2 reduced inflammation, but only DMC2 did so with the preservation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.","output":"Artemisia dracunculus L.

Diagnosing ocular illnesses by hand is time-consuming, error-prone, and complicated. Therefore, an automated ocular disease detection system with computer-aided tools is necessary to detect various eye disorders using fundus pictures. Such a system is now possible as a consequence of deep learning algorithms that have improved image classification capabilities. A deep-learning-based approach to targeted ocular detection is presented in this study. For this study, we used state-of-the-art image classification algorithms, such as VGG-19, to classify the ODIR dataset, which contains 5000 images of eight different classes of the fundus. These classes represent different ocular diseases. However, the dataset within these classes is highly unbalanced. To resolve this issue, the work suggested converting this multiclass classification problem into a binary classification problem and taking the same number of images for both classifications. Then, the binary classifications were trained with VGG-19. The accuracy of the VGG-19 model was 98.13% for the normal (N) versus pathological myopia (M) class; the model reached an accuracy of 94.03% for normal (N) versus cataract (C), and the model provided an accuracy of 90.94% for normal (N) versus glaucoma (G).

METHODS We developed a soft-light overhead illumination system (SOIS) that produced attached shadows on objects. We compared results using the SOIS with those using a conventional illumination system with regard to laparoscopic experience and laparoscope-to-target distances (LTDs). Forty-two medical students and 23 surgeons participated in the study. A peg transfer task (LTD, 120 mm) for students and surgeons, and a suture removal task (LTD, 30 mm) for students were performed. Illumination systems were randomly assigned to each task. Endpoints were: total number of peg transfers; percentage of peg-dropping errors; and total execution time for suture removal. After the task, participants filled out a questionnaire on their preference for a particular illumination system. RESULTS Total number of peg transfers was greater with the SOIS for both students and surgeons. Percentage of peg-dropping errors for surgeons was lower with the SOIS. Total execution time for suture removal was shorter with the SOIS. Forty-five participants (69% in total) evaluated the SOIS for easier task performance.

The study objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab cultures with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures in children with PBB. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab and BAL fluid specimens were collected and cultured for bacterial pathogens prospectively from less than five-year-old children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for chronic wet cough. RESULTS: Of the 59 children included in the study, 26 (44.1%) patients had a positive BAL bacterial culture with neutrophilic inflammation. Prevalence of positive cultures for any of the four common respiratory pathogens implicated in PBB (Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae) was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in NP swabs compared to BAL fluids (86.4% and 44.1% of PBB cases, respectively). NP swab cultures for any of the four main bacterial pathogens had 85% (95% CI: 65-96%) and 48% (95% CI: 31-66%) sensitivity and specificity of detecting PBB, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 56% (95% CI: 47-65%) and 80% (95% CI: 60-91%), respectively. In conclusion, in children less than 5 years of age with chronic wet cough (PBB-clinical), a negative NP swab result reduces the likelihood of lower airway infection; however, a positive NP swab does not accurately predict the presence of lower airway pathogens.

Numerous reports consistently demonstrate that CVDs are a major risk factor for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including higher risks of hospitalizations and inpatient mortality. In the context of the current pandemic, managing patients with CVDs requires special attention from doctors. There are now more and more reports of the long-term effects of COVID-19. The long-term effects on cardiovascular system of millions of COVID-19 survivors are currently unknown. The aim of the review was to systematize the accumulated knowledge about the mutual influence of COVID-19 and CVDs. The features of CVD impact on the course and outcomes of COVID-19, as well as the reasons for the worsening of CVD course in patients with COVID-19 are considered. The impact of redistribution of health care resources and large-scale isolation measures on the management of patients with CVDs is discussed. The review also presents the most relevant data on long COVID. Predictors of a long-term disease course were identified for risk stratification in order to timely implement preventive measures and develop an individualized treatment.

During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.","output":"Prevalence and Clinical Presentation of Health Care Workers With Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in 2 Dutch Hospitals During an Early Phase of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in low-income countries have access to culture facilities in their primary care diagnostic centres and this scenario may have worsened with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

METHODS: A cotton swab containing each sample was decontaminated in NaOH before being dipped into a slightly acidic solution to neutralize the pH in order to allow the culture to develop on LJ medium. Samples (n=543) from suspected or confirmed pulmonary TB were analysed in two phases: standardization (n=167) and evaluation of the study method (n=376). RESULTS: The study method showed sensitivity >95% and specificity >93% using Ogawa-Kudoh (OK) and modified Petroff (MP) as standards and was comparable to MP-LJ (p>0.05) and slightly superior to OK (p=0.03) for sputum culture and more comprehensive than the latter for other pulmonary specimens.

We aimed to ascertain which children were least likely to receive their 2C2? year review and whether there were additional non-mandated contacts for children who missed this review. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2C2? year review and additional health visiting contacts for 181 130 children aged 2 in England 2018/2019, stratified by ethnicity, deprivation, safeguarding vulnerability indicator and Looked After Child status. ANALYSIS: We used data from 33 local authorities submitting highly complete data on health visiting contacts to the Community Services Dataset. We calculated the percentage of children with a recorded 2C2? year review and/or any additional health visiting contacts and average number of contacts, by child characteristic. RESULTS: The most deprived children were slightly less likely to receive a 2C2? year review than the least deprived children (72% vs 78%) and Looked After Children much less likely, compared with other children (44% vs 69%). When all additional contacts were included, the pattern was reversed (deprivation) or disappeared (Looked After children). A substantial proportion of all children (24%), children with a safeguarding vulnerability (22%) and Looked After children (29%) did not have a record of either a 2C2? year review or any other face-to-face contact in the year. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of children aged 2 with known vulnerabilities did not see the health visiting team at all in the year.

We detail the molecular basis for the shared TCR gene usage observed in HLA-A*02:01+ individuals, providing an understanding of TCR recognition towards a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Interestingly, the YLQ peptide conformation did not change upon TCR binding, facilitating the high-affinity interaction observed.","output":"Molecular basis of a dominant SARS-CoV-2 Spike-derived epitope presented by HLA-A*02:01 recognised by a public TCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparo Endoscopic Single-site Surgery (LESS) represents an evolution of minimally invasive surgery and aims to improve cosmetic outcome and reduce surgical trauma and complications associated with traditional laparoscopy. This study was performed to present our preliminary experience in bilateral spermatic cord ligation with the LESS technique and compare the results with the outcomes of conventional laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Between June 2007 and May 2013, 24 patients were referred to our institute for bilateral varicocelectomy. The indications for this type of procedure were bilateral varicocele with impairment of semen parameters or chronic bilateral testicular pain. All procedures were performed via the same surgeon. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of laparoscopic surgery. Group A included 10 patients underwent LESS technique while group B included the remaining 14 patients that underwent conventional laparoscopy. RESULTS The comparison between the two techniques showed some important advantages for LESS: shorter operating time (45.4 min vs. 88.3 (P < .001), shorter hospital stay (16.6 hours vs. 51.4 hours) (P < .001), early return to the normal activity (2.3 days vs. 4.7 days) and better cosmetic outcomes. No conversions from LESS to conventional laparoscopy were necessary and blood loss was insignificant in all patients.All patients in the LESS group reported full satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome, whereas 85.7% of patients after conventional laparoscopy were fully satisfied with cosmesis. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral spermatic cord ligation with LESS is an alternative to conventional laparoscopy. The procedure was successfully performed in all patients. The trans-umbilical approach offers the advantage of a better cosmetic result, shorter hospital stay and less postoperative pain.","output":"Bilateral spermatic cord en bloc ligation by laparoendoscopic single-site surgery: preliminary experience compared to conventional laparoscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Paracetamol is one of the most widely analgesic and antipyretic drugs recently integrated into the supportive therapy of COVID-19. The pharmaceuticals containing methionine with paracetamol may contribute to avoid hepatotoxicity and eventual paracetamol overdose-dependent death. OBJECTIVE: The current work purposes to develop and validate two chromatographic methods for the simultaneous determination of methionine and paracetamol in presence of two paracetamol impurities (4-nitrophenol and 4-aminophenol). METHODS: Two chromatographic methods were established and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The first one was a RP-HPLC/UV method based on applying a dual-mode gradient elution. The separation was realized via varying both the composition of the ternary mobile phase (acetonitrileCmethanolCwater) and its flow rate. This strategy enabled a relatively rapid analysis with a satisfactory resolution, although the investigated compounds exhibit a significant difference in lipophilicity. The second one relied on TLC- densitometry, where the optimum separation was realized using a quaternary mobile phase system composed of butanolCdioxaneCtolueneCmethanol (8: 2.5: 3.5: 0.3, by volume). Both methods were monitored at 220 nm. RESULTS: The developed methods were proven to be robust, accurate, specific, and appropriate for the routine analysis of paracetamol in its pure form or in pharmaceutical formulations with methionine in quality control laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: The corresponding methods are suitable to determine methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities. HIGHLIGHTS: The study achieves the analysis of methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities via the application of HPLC and TLC- densitometry methods.","output":"Dual-mode gradient HPLC and TLC densitometry methods for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol and methionine in the presence of paracetamol impurities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has strongly marked the Italian territory and had had consequences in the healthy sphere, as it is clear, and also in the social and economic fabric of the countries.

In this study, the effect of glycyrrhizin on pseudomonal skin infections was studied in a chimera model of thermal injury. Two different chimera models were utilized. Patient chimeras were created in murine antimicrobial peptide-depleted NOD-SCID IL-2r(null) mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with the same patient peripheral blood CD31(+) IMC. Patient chimera substitutes were created in the same mice that were grafted with NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31(+) IMC. In the results, both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin resisted a 20 LD(50) dose of P. aeruginosa skin infection, while all chimeras in both groups treated with saline died within 3 days of the infection. Human antimicrobial peptides were detected from the grafted site tissues of both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin, while the peptides were not detected in the same area tissues of controls. HBD-1 was produced by keratinocytes in transwell-cultures performed with CD31(+) IMC and glycyrrhizin. Also, inhibitors (IL-10 and CCL2) of HBD-1 production by keratinocytes were not detected in cultures of patient CD31(+) IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from pseudomonal grafted site infections in a chimera model of burn injury is controllable by glycyrrhizin.

Bereaved relatives may develop complicated grief as a consequence of this burdensome situation; however, little is known about appropriate options in quality care supporting bereaved relatives and the prevalence and predictors of complicated grief in bereaved relatives of deceased ICU patients in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a multicomponent bereavement support intervention for relatives of deceased ICU patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress in bereaved relatives. METHODS: The study will use a cross-sectional pre-post design in a 38-bed ICU in a university hospital in the Netherlands. Cohort 1 includes all reported first and second contact persons of patients who died in the ICU in 2018, which will serve as a pre-intervention baseline measurement. Based on existing policies, facilities and evidence-based practices, a nurse-led intervention will be developed and implemented during the study period. This intervention is expected to use 1) communication strategies, 2) materials to make a keepsake, and 3) a nurse-led follow-up service. Cohort 2, including all bereaved relatives in the ICU from October 2019 until March 2020, will serve as a post-intervention follow-up measurement. Both cohorts will be performed in study samples of 200 relatives per group, all participants will be invited to complete questionnaires measuring complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress. Differences between the baseline and follow-up measurements will be calculated and adjusted using regression analyses. Exploratory subgroup analyses (e.g., gender, ethnicity, risk profiles, relationship with patient, length of stay) and exploratory dose response analyses will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The newly developed intervention has the potential to improve the bereavement process of the relatives of deceased ICU patients. Therefore, symptoms of grief and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, might decrease.

It also risks costing health systems the opportunity to make their services more efficient and, over time, more economical. This paper sets out the potential of biomarker testing, the unfolding precision and range of possible diagnosis and prediction, and the many obstacles to adoption. It offers case studies of biomarker testing in breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, thyroid and colon cancers, and derives specific lessons as to the potential and actual use of each of them. It also draws lessons about how to improve access and alignment, and to remedy the data deficiencies that impede development. And it suggests solutions to outstanding issues - notably including funding and the tangled web of obtaining reimbursement or equivalent coverage that Europe's fragmented health system implies. It urges a European evolution towards an initial minimum testing scenario, which would guarantee universal access to a suite of biomarker tests for the currently most common conditions, and, further into the future, to an optimum testing scenario in which a much wider range of biomarker tests would be introduced and become part of a more sophisticated health system articulated around personalised medicine. For exploiting genomics to the full, it argues the need for a new policy framework for Europe. Biomarker testing is not an issue that can be treated in isolation, since the purpose of testing is to improve health. Its use is therefore always closely linked to specific health challenges and needs to be viewed in the broader policy context in the EU and more widely. The paper is the result of extensive engagement with experts and decision makers to develop the framework, and consequently represents a wide consensus of views on how healthcare systems should respond from push and pull factors at local, national and cross-border and EU level. It contains strong views and clear recommendations springing from the convictions of patients, clinicians, academics, medicines authorities, HTA bodies, payers, the diagnostic, pharmaceutical and ICT industries, and national policy makers.","output":"Bringing Greater Accuracy to Europe's Healthcare Systems: The Unexploited Potential of Biomarker Testing in Oncology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Money laundering has ascended the enforcement and criminological agenda in the course of this century, and has been accompanied by an increased focus on legal professionals as enablers of crime.

These changes may have affected overall exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), an air pollutant and source of health harm. We report the results of a simulation model of a representative sample of the UKs population, including workers and non-workers, to estimate PM2.5 exposure before and during the pandemic. Methods: PM2.5 exposure was simulated in April and August 2017C2020 for 10,000 individuals across the UK drawn from the 2011 nationwide census. These data were combined with data from the UKs ambient PM2.5 monitoring network, time use data and data on relevant personal behaviour before and during the first stage of the pandemic (such as changes in smoking and cooking). Results: The simulated exposures were significantly different between each year. Changes in ambient PM2.5 resulted in regional and temporal variation. People living in homes where someone smoked experienced higher exposure than those in smoke-free homes, with an increase of 4 g/m3 in PM2.5 exposure in 2020. Conclusions: Changes in PM2.5 exposure were minimal for most individuals despite the simulated increases in cooking activity. Those living in smoking homes (estimated to be around 11% of the UK population) experienced increased exposure to PM2.5 during COVID lockdown measures and this is likely to have increased mortality and morbidity among this group.

Our research (Natsal-COVID) indicates that in the UK, 10% of people aged 18C59 had physical or sexual contact with a romantic or sexual partner outside their household (PCOH) during a period in which contact was limited. We explored motivations and decision-making among people reporting PCOH in the four months following the initial national lockdown on 23rd March 2020.MethodSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 individuals reporting PCOH during a period in which physical distancing measures were in place. Participants were recruited through a large, quasi-representative survey investigating sexual behaviour in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic (Natsal-COVID). Interviews were analysed thematically.ResultsParticipants were single (n=8) or in long-term, non-cohabiting, relationships (n=10). While participants in the two groups differed in their reported motivations for PCOH, all demonstrated complex and individualised decision-making, weighing up risks such as SARS-CoV-2 transmission, judgement of peers, and benefits, including feelings of security and improved mental health. For those in relationships, the primary motivation was continuity: participants expected to continue seeing their romantic partner. Participants rationalised this contact as low risk in relation to other risks of COVID-19 exposure, and reduced other activities (such as shopping, seeing friends) to maintain this contact. For single participants, loneliness and boredom were reported as the primary motivators for PCOH, with dating apps often used to facilitate contact. For both groups, evidence of considered decision-making was clear, with participants referencing government guidance, personal situations, and risk when describing their deliberations.ConclusionIndividuals did not make decisions about PCOH lightly. However, physical contact with partners was considered important and thus rationalised.

Health care providers are at the front line of fighting, as well as, at the risk of getting infected. Many attempts have been made to combat the disease are mostly focused on hospital settings rather than outpatient settings so far. Therefore, addressing the clinics and medical offices with numerous health care workers seems necessary. Methods: Using keywords COVID-19 OR SARS-COV-2 OR Corona virus, AND Infection control OR Prevention AND (Outpatient settings) OR clinics OR (medical offices) AND (health care workers) OR (health care personnel) in databases and pertinent sites: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Up - to-date, Clinical Key, Google Scholar, guidelines, and health organization like CDC, W.H.O., high impact journals, and publications of Iran ministry of health related to outpatient settings, the medical literature for all published full text articles pertinent to medical practice in clinics and medical offices and COVID-19 disease were searched. All pertinent data were collected and then organized them in a step by step guide for health care workers. Results: Based on findings, the majority of patients (80%) with COVID-19 have mild disease and no need to primarily be admitted to hospitals. Since these patients are the source of infection, referrals to all clinics and hospitals have the risk of transmission of the infection to medical staff as well as, other non-COVID patients. They could be quarantined at home, evaluated by physicians via telemedicine, receive appropriate medical advice, and followed up regularly. Tele visit: Tele visit via telephone or video call eliminates unnecessary public or private transportation and the risk of transmission, as well as, face to face visits and exposing health care workers and other patients to the virus. Regarding limited health care resources, face to face unnecessary visits impose dual pressure upon an already overloaded health care system. Emergency departments and hospitals should be dedicated to the remaining 20% of COVID patients with moderate to severe disease Signs and Symptoms: Signs and symptoms of myriads of COVID-19 patients have been assessed. 27 signs and symptoms have been found common to patients. 4 out of 27 signs and symptoms most consistent with the disease are: fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia/arthralgia. Moreover, one of the relatively characteristic symptoms of COVID-19 disease is, sudden and recently- onset loss of smell and taste in the context of other signs and symptoms. It should be differentiated from chronic and already present loss of smell, associated with chronic diseases like nasal polyposis, chronic sinusitis and neurologic problems. Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability, like hypotension and reduced urine output, as well as, decreased level of consciousness, and chest pain are alarming and should be sought. Patients with these conditions need to be admitted to hospitals. Approaching patients with dyspnea remotely, Physicians should consider differential diagnoses like exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, and anxiety. Oxygen saturation evaluation: Patients could be instructed to monitor their oxygen saturation by home pulse oximeters twice a day and report it to physicians. If oxygen saturation is 95% or more with room air, and not having other risk factors, they could remain quarantined at home. Patients with oxygen saturation of 94% or less should be visited face to face in medical centers. Elevator etiquette: If you have flu-like symptoms, do not use the elevator. Keep a distance of 1.5 meter from other riders. If the space is not enough, wait for the next turn ride or use the stairs. Don't touch the buttons with naked hands;Touch them with tissue paper or your elbow instead. Have disinfectant available and disinfect your hands before and after touching the buttons. Do not touch your eyes, mouth and nose after touching the buttons. Stay facing the walls of the elevator. Wash or disinfect your hands immediately after getting off the elevator in case of touching buttons. At the entrance of the clinic: Place posters, and stands with alarming and educational matters about COVID- 19 disease. Screen all patients, as well as, companions for the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Limit the entrance of companions to the clinic and not allow those who were exposed to COVID patients in recent two weeks. Get all patients to wear masks and disinfect their hands with alcohol based disinfectant solutions before entering the clinic. Waiting room: Limit the number of patients at the waiting room. The distance between patients should be at least two meters. Put partition between them if it is feasible. Open the windows and doors 6-12 times per hour. Have disinfectant solutions in the waiting room and soap in the washing closet available to all patients. Cough etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper or your internal surface of your elbow in case of coughing or sneezing. Discard the tissues in dustbin after coughing or sneezing and wash your hands. Physician's room: Use a paperless system for transmitting medical records between physicians and secretory or para clinics. The distance between physician and patient should be at least 2 meters. Physicians should change the gloves after each visit. The disposable table cloth should be changed and the table and all the surfaces touched by the patient should be disinfected after each visit. Follow up of patients at home: Patients at home should be followed up regularly at daily basis and then setting up the frequency and duration of follow ups based on patient health condition. Personal protective equipment: Medical staff should wear full personal protective equipment including N-95 Masks, goggles, face shields, gowns and gloves. Monitoring medical and allied health care staff: Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 should be monitored regularly and the test RT-PCR should be performed every 3 days for health care workers in close contact with suspected COVID patients. Return to work: Health care personnel could return to work from 10 to 20 days after onset of the disease, provided that symptoms have resolved and had been afebrile without the use of antipyretics for at least 24 hours. Donning and Doffing: Errors in donning and doffing have been observed even among experienced personnel. Therefore, the order of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment should be followed for prevention of infection. Nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures: Given dispersing the virus particles by nebulizers around 10 meters, nebulizers and aerosol producing procedures, should not be used routinely in clinics unless the patient is isolated, the doors closed, and the personnel out of the room. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a newly emerged and highly contagious disease. Its diagnosis is based on multiple signs and symptoms, as well as, laboratory and imaging findings. This disease has no approved treatment and all medications are used based on clinical trials so far. Therefore, the best practice policy is prevention. One of the available facilities that could help in prevention of the disease is telemedicine. Around 80% of patients, who have mild disease, could be followed up, quarantined at home and managed by telemedicine. Those at home should be monitored daily and if their condition worsened need to be admitted to special centers dedicated to COVID-19 patients. They should not be referred to all clinics or admitted to all hospital wards. Unnecessary referrals lead to spread of the infection. Hospitals and clinics are already overloaded and medical personnel exhausted. Medical personnel, as national resources should be preserved for the remaining 20% of patients with moderate to severe disease. Since health care workers are exposed to the high load of the virus and they may receive the viral load from multiple sources, their disease is often more severe, the risk of mortal ty and the risk of transmitting the infection to others is higher than the general population. Therefore, providing them with full personal protective equipment and monitoring their health condition is essential. ? 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

So far, mainly ascorbate oxidases from plants and only a few from fungi have been described. Although ascorbate oxidases belong to the well-studied enzyme family of multi-copper oxidases, their function is still unclear. In this study, Af_AO1, an enzyme from the fungus Aspergillus flavus, was characterized. Sequence analyses and copper content determination demonstrated Af_AO1 to belong to the multi-copper oxidase family. Biochemical characterization and 3D-modeling revealed a similarity to ascorbate oxidases, but also to laccases. Af_AO1 had a 10-fold higher affinity to ascorbic acid (KM = 0.16  0.03 mM) than to ABTS (KM = 1.89  0.12 mM). Furthermore, the best fitting 3D-model was based on the ascorbate oxidase from Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo. The laccase-like activity of Af_AO1 on ABTS (Vmax = 11.56  0.15 M/min/mg) was, however, not negligible.

Cabinet documents, parliamentary speeches, and previous analyses reveal that governments change referendums in unique ways depending on the political circumstances, including precedents set by earlier referendums. Once set in motion, these processes of gradual institutional change can fundamentally transform the functional qualities of the referendum over time.

In COVID-19 patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL-6 preliminarily resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL-6 24 to 48 hours before and 12 to 48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL-6 was not different at baseline (P = .41), while 24 to 48 hours post-tocilizumab IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (2398.5 [430.5-9372] vs 290.5 [58.5-1305.5] pg/mL, P = .022). Serum IL-6 post-tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors (area under the curve, 0.815; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.99, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Repeated measurement of the serum level of IL-6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish nonsurvivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Higher levels of IL-6 early after tocilizumab distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors in COVID-19 pneumonia: A possible indication for deeper targeting of IL-6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: To date, the influence that physical activity (PA)/physical exercise (PE) can exert on the human gut microbiota (GM) is still poorly understood. Several issues arise in structuring research in this area, starting from the association between PA/PE and diet. Indeed, the diet of an individual is a key factor for the composition of the GM and those who regularly practice PA/PE, generally, have dietary patterns favorable to the creation of an ideal environment for the proliferation of a GM capable of contributing to the hosts health. It is therefore difficult to establish with certainty whether the effects generated on the GM are due to a PA protocol, the type of diet followed, or to both. In addition, most of the available studies use animal models to investigate a possible correlation between PA/PE and changes in the GM, which may be not necessarily applied to humans. Evidence suggests that aerobic PA/PE seems capable of producing significant changes in GM; training parameters, likewise, can differentially influence the GM in young or elderly people and these changes appear to be transient and reversible. ABSTRACT: Several studies have been conducted to find at least an association between physical activity (PA)/ physical exercise (PE) and the possibility to modulate the gut microbiome (GM). However, the specific effects produced on the human GM by different types of PA/PE, different training modalities, and their age-related effects are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate and summarize the current scientific evidence investigating the bi-directional relationship between PA/PE and the human GM, with a specific focus on the different types/variables of PA/PE and age-related effects, in healthy and unhealthy people. A systematic search was conducted across four databases (Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library). Information was extracted using the populations, exposure, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICOS) format. The Oxford Quality Scoring System Scale, the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies were used as a qualitative measure of the review. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42022302725). The following data items were extracted: author, year of publication, study design, number and age of participants, type of PA/PE carried out, protocol/workload and diet assessment, duration of intervention, measurement tools used, and main outcomes. Two team authors reviewed 694 abstracts for inclusion and at the end of the screening process, only 76 full texts were analyzed. Lastly, only 25 research articles met the eligibility criteria. The synthesis of these findings suggests that GM diversity is associated with aerobic exercise contrary to resistance training; abundance of Prevotella genus seems to be correlated with training duration; no significant change in GM richness and diversity are detected when exercising according to the minimum dose recommended by the World Health Organizations; intense and prolonged PE can induce a higher abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria; PA does not lead to significant GM /-diversity in elderly people (60+ years). The heterogeneity of the training parameters used in the studies, diet control, and different sequencing methods are the main confounders. Thus, this systematic review can provide an in-depth overview of the relationship between PA/PE and the human intestinal microbiota and, at the same time, provide indications from the athletic and health perspective.","output":"The Relationship between Physical Activity, Physical Exercise, and Human Gut Microbiota in Healthy and Unhealthy Subjects: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel COVID-19 disease has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. These impacts are likely to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. There are no methods for characterizing the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and differentiating this burden from that of the prepandemic era. Accurate illness detection methods are critical for facilitating pandemic-related treatment and preventing the worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify major themes and symptom clusters in the SMS text messages that patients send to therapists. We assessed patients who were seeking treatment for pandemic-related distress on Talkspace, which is a popular telemental health platform. METHODS: We used a machine learning algorithm to identify patients pandemic-related concerns, based on their SMS text messages in a large, digital mental health service platform (ie, Talkspace). This platform uses natural language processing methods to analyze unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessment methods for analyzing depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Our results show a significant increase in the incidence of COVID-19Crelated intake anxiety symptoms (P<.001), but no significant differences in the incidence of intake depression symptoms (P=.79). During our transcript analyses, we identified terms that were related to 24 symptoms outside of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for Talkspace suggest that people who seek treatment during the pandemic experience more severe intake anxiety than they did before the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to monitor the symptoms that we identified in this study and the symptoms of anxiety and depression, to fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","output":"Analyzing Digital Evidence From a Telemental Health Platform to Assess Complex Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of Text Messages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Defect prediction on unlabelled datasets is a challenging and widespread problem in software engineering. Machine learning is of great value in this context because it provides techniques - called unsupervised - that are applicable to unlabelled datasets. Objective: This study aims at comparing various approaches employed over the years on unlabelled datasets to predict the defective modules, i.e. the ones which need more attention in the testing phase. Our comparison is based on the measurement of performance metrics and on the real defective information derived from software archives. Our work leverages a new dataset that has been obtained by extracting and preprocessing its metrics from a C++ software. Method: Our empirical study has taken advantage of CLAMI with its improvement CLAMI+ that we have applied on high energy physics software datasets. Furthermore, we have used clustering techniques such as the K-means algorithm to find potentially critical modules. Results: Our experimental analysis have been carried out on 1 open source project with 34 software releases. We have applied 17 ML techniques to the labelled datasets obtained by following the CLAMI and CLAMI+ approaches. The two approaches have been evaluated by using different performance metrics, our results show that CLAMI+ performs better than CLAMI. The predictive average accuracy metric is around 95% for 4 ML techniques (4 out of 17) that show a Kappa statistic greater than 0.80. We applied K-means on the same dataset and obtained 2 clusters labelled according to the output of CLAMI and CLAMI+.

We present a six-month strategy to empower patients caregivers on HCW HH compliance. METHODS: HH compliance in HCWs was evaluated between June 1 and August 31, 2017 as recommended by WHO. Between September 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 we undertook the empowering in the hematology-oncology ward (50 beds) from Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, a cancer referral, teaching hospital in Mexico. To empower patients and their caregivers, a member of the team visited the patient and their relatives during the first 24h of hospital admission. Standarized information on HH and the importance of HCW compliance was given, along with a printed cartoon on HH opportunities (5 moments from WHO). Patients and their caregivers were trained to observe and record HH opportunties, an were invited to remind HCWs if HH omissions were observed. Data on HH compliance was collected monthly during the empowerment and 1 month after. Data was compared with the HH compliance from the 6 previous. We compared overall compliance and for each 5 HH moments before and after the empowering (chi (2) test). RESULTS: We empowered 82 caregivers (M: 25.6%) and F: 74.4%), mean age 44 years. 24.4% had completed primary education, and 13.1% had higher education. Mothers and spouses were the primary caregivers (28.1% and 36.6%). HH compliance increased in all 5 moments: Before touching a patient (M1) (B: 9.5%, A: 57.6%, P = 0.005); before a clean or aseptic procedure (M2) (B: 7.9%, A: 48%, P = 0.002); after body fluid exposure (M3) (B: 10%, A: 59%, P = 0.0005), after touching a patient (M4) (B: 7.4%, A: 57.9%, P = 0.0005), and after touching patient surroundings (M5) (B: 2.4%, A: 77.4%, P = 0.0008). Nurses achieved a higher increase on compliance compared with physicians. Caregivers recognition on HH increased for each opporunity, being more notorious for M2 (B:31.7%, A: 61.5%); M3 (B: 7.3%, A: 31.5%), and M4, (B: 36.5%, A: 68.7%). Perception on the importance of preventing health-care-related infections increased from 80.5% to 90.3%. CONCLUSION: Empowering patients primary caregivers was an effective intervention to increase HCWs HH compliance at a hematology-oncology ward. The effect of this intervention remains to be evaluated on the long-term basis, but demonstrate the importance of involving patients and their relatives on health-care delivery.

However, the requirement for strong organic solvent in polymerization reactions often necessitates extra protection steps for encapsulation of target biomolecules, lowering encapsulation efficiency, and increasing process complexity. This study reports a novel coating strategy that allows direct solvation and encapsulation of antimicrobial peptides (HHC36) into anhydrous polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer-based dual layer coating. A thin 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) film is layered onto the peptide-impregnated PCL as a diffusion barrier, to modulate and enhance release kinetics. The impregnated peptides are eventually released in a controlled fashion. The use of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), as polymerization and solvation medium, induces the impregnated peptides to adopt highly stable turned conformation, conserving peptide integrity, and functionality during both encapsulation and subsequent release processes. The dual layer coating showed sustained antibacterial functionality, lasting for 14 days. In vivo assessment using an experimental mouse wounding model demonstrated good biocompatibility and significant antimicrobial efficacy of the coating under physiological conditions. The coating was translated onto silicone urinary catheters and showed promising antibacterial efficacy, even outperforming commercial silver-based Dover cather.

Abstract Introduction: Interventional oncology should remain a priority among interventional radiology procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. It should be adapted to anesthetic resources and hospital beds capacity. Oncology patients not affected by COVID-19 should be treated in a safe environment to reduce the risk of exposure. Take-home points: Diagnostic and interventional radiology in oncology should remain a priority consideration during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. Health status, comorbidities and risk of being severely affected by COVID-19 should be taken into consideration for post postponement of elective procedures or patient referral to a hospital not specialized in the fight against COVID-19. The different steps of the oncology clinical pathway including pluridisciplinary tumor board, pre and post-interventional office visits, pre and post-procedural imaging and interventional radiology procedures should be reorganized in order to provide appropriate services (hygiene practices and physical barriers) to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patients et healthcare personnel. Phone calls to patients planned to be admitted the following days should be organized to ensure these patients do not present any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Telemedicine or phone calls should replace office visits unless an ultrasound examination is scheduled for the pre-intervention evaluation. If CT examination is necessary for the oncological evaluation, pulmonary lesions compatible with COVID-19 may be accidentally diagnosed. Careful attention should be paid to the indications and types of drugs used for general anesthesia in patients with COVID-19 because of medication shortage and to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Locoregional anesthesia should be favored. Minimally-invasive interventional oncology procedures should be favored as an alternative to surgery to spare medical resources and medications in accordance with the recommendations of national oncological societies. Institutional healthcare policies and protocols must be organized with identification of dedicated COVID-19 transportation and care sections. Conclusion: Oncological procedures should be prioritized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protective measures must be in place throughout the hospital and the radiology department to reduce the risks of exposure of the patients and the staff. Interventional radiology procedures offered as alternative treatments to surgery may optimize medical resources, anesthetic drugs and critical care unit beds.","output":"Comment je fais: Prise en charge des patients en Radiologie Interventionnelle Oncologique en priode de pandmie au SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SMER28 (Small molecule enhancer of Rapamycin 28) is an autophagy-inducing compound functioning by a hitherto unknown mechanism. Here, we confirm its autophagy-inducing effect by assessing classical autophagy-related parameters. Interestingly, we also discovered several additional effects of SMER28, including growth retardation and reduced G1 to S phase progression. Most strikingly, SMER28 treatment led to a complete arrest of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and, consequently, growth factor-induced cell scattering and dorsal ruffle formation. This coincided with a dramatic reduction in phosphorylation patterns of PI3K downstream effectors. Consistently, SMER28 directly inhibited PI3K and to a lesser extent p110. The biological relevance of our observations was underscored by SMER28 interfering with InlB-mediated host cell entry of Listeria monocytogenes, which requires signaling through the prominent receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. This effect was signaling-specific, since entry of unrelated, gram-negative Salmonella Typhimurium was not inhibited. Lastly, in B cell lymphoma cells, which predominantly depend on tonic signaling through PI3K, apoptosis upon SMER28 treatment is profound in comparison to non-hematopoietic cells. This indicates SMER28 as a possible drug candidate for the treatment of diseases that derive from aberrant PI3K activity.","output":"SMER28 Attenuates PI3K/mTOR Signaling by Direct Inhibition of PI3K p110 Delta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the Jean-Minjoz regional University Hospital Center in Besan?on (25), the therapeutic education of patients with heart failure is carried out by a multidisciplinary team.

Male students reported higher obesity rates (37.1%vs19.4%, P < 0.001) and greater problematic smartphone use scores (25.65  10.37 vs 22.88  8.94, P < 0.001) than female students. Problematic smartphone use for entertainment (smartphone users addicted to entertainment games, music, videos, novels and other applications) was positively associated to obesity status for primary school [odds ratio (OR), 1.030; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.005C1.057] and high school students (OR, 1.031; 95% CI, 1.004C1.059). For female students, problematic smartphone use for entertainment was positively associated with obesity status (OR, 1.046; 95% CI, 1.018C1.075). CONCLUSIONS: Problematic smartphone use may be associated with obesity in children and adolescents. The association differed based on the educational stage and sex, and the difference possessed dimensional specificity.

These diseases threaten the lives of many people and cause serious social and economic losses. Recent developments in information technology (IT) and connectivity have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in many industries. These industries, where IoT and AI together are making significant impacts, are the healthcare and the diagnosis department. In addition, by actively communicating with smart devices and various biometric sensors, it is expanding its application fields to telemedicine, healthcare, and disease prevention. Even though existing IoT and AI technologies can enhance disease detection, monitoring, and quarantine, their impact is very limited because they are not integrated or applied rapidly to the emergence of a sudden epidemic. Especially in the situation where infectious diseases are rapidly spreading, the conventional methods fail to prevent large-scale infections and block global spreads through prediction, resulting in great loss of lives. Therefore, in this paper, various sources of infection information with local limitations are collected through virus disease information collector, and AI analysis and severity matching are performed through AI broker. Finally, through the Integrated Disease Control Center, risk alerts are issued, proliferation block letters are sent, and post-response services are provided quickly. Suppose we further develop the proposed integrated virus disease control model. In that case, it will be possible to proactively detect and warn of risk factors in response to infectious diseases that are rapidly spreading worldwide and strengthen measures to prevent spreading of infection in no time.","output":"Convergence model of AI and IoT for virus disease control system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Helicobacter pylori (HP) colonizes the human stomach and induces acute gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) results in significant hypoxia, and ARDS is the central pathology of COVID-19. Inhaled prostacyclin has been proposed as a therapy for ARDS, but data regarding its role in this syndrome are unavailable. Therefore, we investigated whether inhaled prostacyclin would affect the oxygenation and survival of patients suffering from ARDS. Methods. We performed a prospective randomized controlled single-blind multicenter trial across Germany. The trial was conducted from March 2019 with final follow-up on 12 th of August 2021. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS were included and randomized to receive either inhaled prostacyclin (3 times/day for 5 days) or sodium chloride. The primary outcome was the oxygenation index in the intervention and control groups on Day 5 of therapy. Secondary outcomes were mortality, secondary organ failure, disease severity and adverse events. Findings. Of 707 patients approached 150 patients were randomized to receive inhaled prostacyclin (n=73) or sodium chloride (n=77). Data from 144 patients were analyzed. The baseline oxygenation index did not differ between groups. The primary analysis of the study was negative, and prostacyclin improved oxygenation by 20 mmHg more than NaCl (p=0.17). Oxygenation was significantly improved in patients with ARDS who were COVID-19-positive (34 mmHg, p=0.04). Mortality did not differ between groups. Secondary organ failure and adverse events were similar in the intervention and control groups. Interpretation.

METHODS Fifty-three patients (13 girls; mean age 7.2 years, 20% younger than 10 years of age) who underwent bone scintigraphy for suspected OO between 2005 and 2010 were included in the study, of whom 46 underwent a radiography at diagnosis. Computed tomography-guided biopsy was performed in all patients after bone scintigraphy, and radiofrequency ablation was performed following biopsy in patients with OO; ablation efficacy was confirmed by MRI at 1, 3, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS The radiographic results were negative in 27/46 patients and was unclear in 19. Bone scintigraphy showed lesions in 53/53 patients, of whom 51 patients had a typical pattern of osteoma and nine patients required an additional scan with a pinhole collimator. Histological examination showed OO in 51/53 patients (3/51 intramedullary), Ewing's sarcoma in 1/53 patients, and chronic osteomyelitis in 1/53 patients. CONCLUSION Any child with recurrent nocturnal pain and/or limb swelling should undergo radiography of the involved skeletal segment, which is the first-choice diagnostic method in the clinical suspicion of OO. In the event of ambiguous or negative radiographic results, bone scintigraphy is needed to exclude other pathologic conditions and to confirm the diagnosis. In children with recurrent but not well-localized bone pain in which OO is strongly suspected for signs and symptoms, a bone scan can help detect the lesion. The diagnostic accuracy of the bone scan, particularly for the appendicular skeleton, can be improved by pinhole collimator acquisition.","output":"Role of three-phase bone scintigraphy in paediatric osteoid osteoma eligible for radiofrequency ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected individuals with lived experience of eating disorders (EDs), with many reporting higher psychological distress, higher prevalence of ED symptoms, and compensatory behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety measures taken to contain its spread also disrupted routines and reduced access to familiar coping mechanisms, social support networks, and health care services. Social media and the ED communities on social media platforms have been an important source of support for individuals with EDs in the past. So far, it is unknown how discussions in online ED communities changed as offline support networks were disrupted and people spent more time at home in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify changes in language content and style in an online ED community during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We extracted posts and their comments from the ED community on the social media website Reddit and concatenated them to comment threads. To analyze these threads, we applied top-down and bottom-up language analysis methods based on topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and 13 indicators from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, respectively. Threads were split into prepandemic (before March 11, 2020) and midpandemic (after March 11, 2020) groups. Standardized mean differences were calculated to estimate change between pre- and midpandemic threads. RESULTS: A total of 17,715 threads (n=8772, 49.5% prepandemic threads; n=8943, 50.5% midpandemic threads) were extracted from the ED community and analyzed. The final topic model contained 21 topics. CIs excluding zero were found for standardized mean differences of 15 topics and 9 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories covering themes such as ED symptoms, mental health, treatment for EDs, cognitive processing, social life, and emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed a reduction in discussions about ED symptoms, an increase in mental health and treatment-related topics was observed at the same time. This points to a change in the focus of the ED community from promoting potentially harmful weight loss methods to bringing attention to mental health and treatments for EDs. These results together with heightened cognitive processing, increased social references, and reduced inhibition of negative emotions detected in discussions indicate a shift in the ED community toward a pro-recovery orientation.","output":"Changes in Language Style and Topics in an Online Eating Disorder Community at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is well known to cause significant lower respiratory symptoms, recent literature has documented numerous cases of multi-systemic involvement that can present with atypical symptoms.

Twitter, forums, and other (Facebook, Blogs, etc.) platforms were leveraged for the time period February 2020 to February 2021. Results: A total of 464 (UK=208, US=175, Canada=65 and Australia=16) patient/caregiver conversations on COP were identified. Top discussion points were symptoms (62%) and causes of COP (58%). Ocular factors (including dry eye disease, thyroid/Graves disease, and ocular surgeries) contributed to 46% of causes identified, while non-ocular factors (including migraine, COVID, and side-effects/withdrawal of medications) contributed to 54%. The most commonly mentioned symptoms (555) were headache/head pressures (96), dry/gritty eyes (67), light sensitivity (34), insomnia (29), and redness/pink eyes (28). Symptoms impacted all aspects of patients QoL: physical day-to-day activities such as reading, driving, and sleeping;emotional wellbeing such as depression/hopelessness, frustration/anger, fear, and suicidal thoughts;functional wellbeing such as difficulty at work/study place, reduced productivity or having to quit their job;social impacts such as being irritated around people, and having a less active social life.

Nowadays, double adenomas remain a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic task. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 64-year-old woman was referred to an endocrine surgeon to evaluate a persistently elevating level of calcium. In the biochemical analysis the serum level of total calcium was increased - 2.79 mmol/l, ionized calcium - 1.64 mmol/l, parathyroid hormone - 191.4 pg/mL. Ultrasound and MSCT scan of the neck showed an increase of the parathyroid glands under the lower poles of both lobes of the thyroid gland. No functionally active parathyroid glands were found on scintigraphy. The patient underwent bilateral neck exploration with identi?cation of all four parathyroid glands and a double parathyroid adenomectomy. According to a histological study, the removed parathyroid glands are represented by adenomas from the dark main cells. Remission of primary hyperparathyroidism was achieved. DISCUSSION This clinical report confirms the literature on a decrease in the sensitivity of imaging methods in the diagnosis of double adenomas. A decrease in the effectiveness of intraoperative monitoring of parathyroid hormone with double adenomas was confirmed. In this patient, a double parathyroid adenomectomy was sufficient to achieve remission of hyperparathyroidism. CONCLUSION With double adenomas, a comprehensive assessment of all imaging methods is required. A positive test during intraoperative monitoring of IPTG does not exclude a double adenoma in a patient.

The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritized development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomized controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19.

It was soon discovered that the disease was caused by a novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, and the disease was thus abbreviated to COVID-19 (COVID). The global medical community has directed its efforts not only to find effective therapies against the deadly pathogen but also to combat the concomitant complications. Two of the most common respiratory manifestations of COVID are a significant reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lungs (DLCO) and the associated pulmonary interstitial damage. One year after moderate COVID, the incidence rate of impaired DLCO and persistent lung damage still exceeds 30%, and one-third of the patients have severe DLCO impairment and fibrotic lung damage. The persistent respiratory complications may cause substantial population morbidity, long-term disability, and even death due to the lung fibrosis progression. The incidence of COVID-induced pulmonary fibrosis caused by COVID can be estimated based on a 15-year observational study of lung pathology after SARS. Most SARS patients with fibrotic lung damage recovered within the first year and then remained healthy; however, in 20% of the cases, significant fibrosis progression was found in 5C10 years. Based on these data, the incidence rate of post-COVID lung fibrosis can be estimated at 2C6% after moderate illness. What is worse, there are reasons to believe that fibrosis may become one of the major long-term complications of COVID, even in asymptomatic individuals. Currently, despite the best efforts of the global medical community, there are no treatments for COVID-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we analyze the latest data from ongoing clinical trials aimed at treating post-COVID lung fibrosis and analyze the rationale for the current drug candidates. We discuss the use of antifibrotic therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the IN01 vaccine, glucocorticosteroids as well as the stromal vascular fraction for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with COVID-associated pulmonary damage.","output":"Lung Fibrosis after COVID-19: Treatment Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We formulate the abelian six-dimensional $\\\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory perturbatively, in a generalization of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment. METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. FINDINGS: Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=041; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p<00001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 061, 95% CI 040C092; p=0020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p<00001).

However, there has been no study examining the role of interpersonal relationships in dysmenorrhea and how they may interact with negative emotions. Aims To investigate the connection between negative affect and dysmenorrhea, and the role of interpersonal relationships plays in this relationship. Methods The Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS), short-form of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Interpersonal Comprehensive Diagnostic Scale and UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale were applied to 855 adolescent nursing students to collect information on severity and frequency of dysmenorrheal symptoms, negative emotions (including depression, anxiety and stress), interpersonal problems and subjective experience of loneliness among them, and the relationship among these variables was examined. Results (1) Both the severity and frequency of dysmenorrhea were positively correlated with negative emotions, loneliness experience and interpersonal problems, while negatively correlated with age at menarche. (2) The negative emotions, romantic relationship and menarche age, but not loneliness and interpersonal problems, significantly contributed to both the severity and frequency of dysmenorrhea. (3) Mediation analysis revealed that the effects of loneliness and interpersonal problems on dysmenorrhea were totally mediated by negative emotions.

We are bombarded with information from many sources, across many digital means of communication, affecting the ways in which we are born, grow, work, live, and age.

Since health systems are already screening for social determinants of health, existing mechanisms can additionally screen for unhealthy information environments. Then, for those patients who screen positive, we can apply best practices learned from initiatives addressing vaccine hesitancy: providing a non-judgmental environment in which to discuss health beliefs, using motivational interviewing techniques to gage patient perspectives and readiness for change, and taking a harm-reduction approach in recognizing that behavior change evolves over time. Displacing misinformation is a process, not an event. As such, we need to address the underlying psychological and sociological reasons that people maintain unscientific beliefs as we would hope to do with any other SDoH.

On 7 February 2021, a deadly disaster occurred near the Rishi Ganga Hydropower Plant in the Rishi Ganga River, killing more than 100 people. During the event, a large volume of debris and broken glacial fragments flooded the Rishi Ganga River and washed away the Rishi Ganga Hydropower plant ongoing project. This study presents the impact of the Chamoli disaster on the water quality of Rishi Ganga River in upstream near Tapovan and Ganga River in downstream near Haridwar through remote sensing data. Five points have been used at different locations across the two study areas and three different indices were used such as Normalized difference water index (NDWI), Normalized difference turbidity Index (NDTI), and Normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), to analyze changes in water quality. Spectral signatures and backscattering coefficients derived from Sentinel-2 Optical and Sentinel-1 Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data were also compared to study the changes in water quality. It was evident from the water quality indices and spectral signatures that the flood plains changed significantly. Using spectral signatures and different indices, the water level in the Chilla dam canal near Haridwar was found to decreased after the Chamoli disaster event as the flood gates were closed to stop the deposit of sediments in the canal. Results suggest changes in water quality parameters (turbidity, chlorophyll concentration, NDWI) at the five locations near the deadly site and far away at Haridwar along the Ganga River.

This leaves the nucleosomal DNA with access restrictions, which impose a significant barrier to repair of damaged DNA. The efficiency of DNA repair has been related to nucleosome structure and chromatin status, which is modulated in part by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones. Numerous studies have suggested a role for acetylation of lysine at position 56 of the H3 histone (H3K56ac) in various DNA transactions, including the response to DNA damage and its association with human cancer. Biophysical studies have revealed that H3K56ac increases DNA accessibility by facilitating spontaneous and transient unwrapping motions of the DNA ends. However, how this acetylation mark modulates nucleosome structure and dynamics to promote accessibility to the damaged DNA for repair factors and other proteins is still poorly understood. Here, we utilize approximately 5-6 microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to delineate the impact of H3K56 acetylation on the nucleosome structure and dynamics, and to elucidate how these nucleosome properties are further impacted when a bulky benzo[a]pyrene-derived DNA lesion is placed near the acetylation site. Our findings reveal that H3K56ac alone induces considerable disturbance to the histone-DNA/histone-histone interactions, and amplifies the distortions imposed by the presence of the lesion. Our work highlights the important role of H3K56 acetylation in response to DNA damage and depicts how access to DNA lesions by the repair machinery can be facilitated within the nucleosome via a key acetylation event.","output":"Molecular dynamics simulations reveal how H3K56 acetylation impacts nucleosome structure to promote DNA exposure for lesion sensing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in absorbing and composite aerosols over India during the first phase of lockdown are examined, using multi-satellite observations While MODIS shows C16 17  1 35% reduction in AOD over the Indian landmass, OMI shows a decrease of C22 4  1 36% (C26 2  1 17%) in AOD (AAOD) Considerable fraction of this AOD difference is contributed by the changes in aerosols at higher altitudes While reduc-tion in AOD of C38 05  1 06% (C39 4  1 12), C23 02  2 63% (C17 08  2 12) and C18 98  2 86% (C28 38  2 39%) is observed over IGP, Northwest and Southern Peninsula respectively from MODIS (OMI), enhance-ment in AOD of 5 16  2 44% (6 82  2 86%) is seen over Centralwest India Reduction in absorbing aero-sols over IGP is C39 18  1 25%, whereas that over Southern Peninsula is C33 1  2 03% These changes are significantly contributed by the changes in dust aerosols, in addition to the decrease in anthropogenic aerosols Though there is a reduction in aerosol load-ing, compared to previous years, gradual increase in AOD and AAOD is seen even during the lockdown period due to strengthening of dust transport More-over, the reduction in total (absorbing) aerosol load-ing over India during the lockdown phase is only 20% (26%), with significant contribution from higher alti-tudes, even in the absence of major anthropogenic sources These results show the dominance of natural aerosols over India during pre-monsoon ? 2021 All Rights Reserved","output":"Dominance of natural aerosols over India in pre-monsoon: inferences from the lockdown effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An account of an experience with contracting an illness that may well have been Covid-19 gives rise to reflections on doubt and on the art of dying well.

T1 (ZADAXIN?) is used worldwide for treating viral infections, immunodeficiencies, and malignancies. Owing to its ability to activate the tolerogenic pathway of tryptophan catabolism - via the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase - T1 potentiates immune tolerance mechanisms, breaking the vicious circle that perpetuates chronic inflammation in response to a variety of infectious noxae. AREAS COVERED T1 has never been studied in Cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the hyperinflammatory state is associated with early and nonresolving activation of innate immunity, which impairs microbial clearance and promotes a self-sustaining condition of progressive lung damage. Optimal CF treatments should, indeed, not only rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein localization and functionality but also alleviate the associated hyperinflammatory pathology. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms, a multidrug approach is required. EXPERT OPINION By providing a multipronged attack against CF, i.e. restraining inflammation and correcting the basic defect, T1 favorably opposed CF symptomatology in preclinical relevant disease settings, thus suggesting its possible exploitation for 'real-life' clinical efficacy in CF. This could represent a major conceptual advance in the CF field, namely the proposal of a drug with the unique activity to correct CFTR defects through regulation of inflammation.","output":"Cellular proteostasis: a new twist in the action of thymosin 1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has enveloped the world and there has been a high incidence of occupational dermatoses related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) during this period.

In this context, the present study investigates 8 flats in London to uncover if during a lockdown, (a) IAQ in the monitored flats deteriorated, (b) the patterns of window operation by occupants changed, and (c) more effective ventilation patterns could enhance IAQ without significant increases in heating energy demand. To this end, one-year?s worth of monitored data on indoor and outdoor environment along with occupant use of windows has been used to analyse the impact of lockdown on IAQ and infer probabilistic models of window operation behaviour. Moreover, using on-site CO2 data, monitored occupancy and operation of windows, the team has calibrated a thermal performance model of one of the flats to investigate the implications of alternative ventilation strategies. The results suggest that despite the extended occupancy during lockdown, occupants relied less on natural ventilation, which led to an increase of median CO2 concentration by up to 300?ppm. However, simple natural ventilation patterns or use of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery proves to be very effective to maintain acceptable IAQ.Practical application: This study provides evidence on the deterioration of indoor air quality resulting from homeworking during imposed lockdowns.

We aimed to address the current uncertainties regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: We included consecutive adult COVID-19 patients without known thyroid disorders, who were admitted to Queen Mary Hospital from July 21 to September 21, 2020 and had serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and anti-thyroid antibodies measured both on admission and at 3 months. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Among 20 patients with abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs) on admission (mostly low fT3), 15 recovered. Among 102 patients with initial normal TFTs, two had new-onset abnormalities that could represent different phases of thyroiditis. Among 104 patients whose anti-thyroid antibody titers were reassessed, we observed increases in anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (P<0.001) and anti-thyroglobulin (P<0.001), but not anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor titers (P=0.486). Of 82 patients with negative anti-TPO findings at baseline, 16 had a significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by >12 U, and four became anti-TPO-positive. Worse baseline clinical severity (P=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (P=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (P=0.005) were associated with a significant increase in anti-TPO titer. CONCLUSION: Most patients with thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis occurred during convalescence, but infrequently. Importantly, our novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19 warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","output":"Insights from a Prospective Follow-up of Thyroid Function and Autoimmunity among COVID-19 Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Our objective was to explore the incidence and early predictive factors of acute kidney injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Clinical outcomes and renal function were monitored until April 12, 2020, with a median follow-up duration of 21 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 14C33]. Results: When first admitted to hospital (baseline), 19.36% (79/408) presented renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]. During follow-up, 3.9% (16/408) developed acute kidney injury (AKI).

We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds.","output":"A multi-mechanism approach reduces length of stay in the ICU for severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical IoT devices are rapidly becoming part of management ecosystems for pandemics such as COVID-19.

METHODS The accuracy of freehand single-pass needle insertions into abdominal phantoms was compared with insertions facilitated with the use of a robotic assistance platform (n = 20 each). Post-procedural CTs were analysed for needle placement error. Percutaneous RFA was simulated by sequentially placing five 17-gauge needle introducers into 5-cm diameter masses (n = 5) embedded within an abdominal phantom. Simulated ablations were planned based on pre-procedural CT, before multi-probe placement was executed freehand. Multi-probe placement was then performed on the same 5-cm mass using the ablation planning software and robotic assistance. Post-procedural CTs were analysed to determine the percentage of untreated residual target. RESULTS Mean needle tip-to-target errors were reduced with use of the IR assistance platform (both P < 0.0001). Reduced percentage residual tumour was observed with treatment planning (P = 0.02).

Since other factors, such as weather conditions, local combustion sources and/or land surface characteristics may contribute to the variation of pollutant concentrations, we proposed two model formulations that allowed the differentiation between the variations in pollutant concentrations due to seasonality from the variations associated to the lockdown policies. The first model compares the changes in 2020, with the ones during the same period in the previous five years, by introducing an offset term, which controls for the long-term average concentrations of each pollutant during 2014C2019. The second approach models only the 2020 data, but adjusts for confounding factors. The results indicated that the latter can better capture the lockdown effect. The measures taken to tackle the virus in Europe reduced the average surface concentrations of NO(2) and PM(2.5) by 29.5% (95% Bayesian credible interval: 28.1%, 30.9%) and 25.9% (23.6%, 28.1%), respectively. To our knowledge, this research is the first to account for the spatio-temporal correlation present in the monitoring data during the pandemic and to assess how it affects estimation of the lockdown effect while accounting for confounding. The proposed methodology improves our understanding of the effect of COVID-19 lockdown policies on the air pollution burden across the continent.","output":"Spatio-temporal modelling of changes in air pollution exposure associated to the COVID-19 lockdown measures across Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently discovered novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus), has brought the whole world to standstill with critical challenges, affecting both health and economic sectors worldwide. Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.","output":"Cerebrovascular and Neurological Dysfunction under the Threat of COVID-19: Is There a Comorbid Role for Smoking and Vaping?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When people become patients, they become vulnerable to their healthcare system and healthcare clinicians.

Methods We performed a retrospective database analysis using a multi-institutional database (TriNetX), looking at all patients diagnosed with gastrostomy tube with subsequent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and vice-versa. We also evaluated patients who had gastrostomy tubes and shunts placed at the same time. We categorized cohorts into patients with device placement after 1-10 days, 11-30 days, and after one month of the other. Our primary endpoints were shunt infection and shunt revision. Results Patients who had same-day gastrostomy tube and shunt placement had a shunt infection rate of 10.06% within five years, and 14.53% had a shunt revision. With prior shunting and subsequent gastrostomy tube placement within 1-10 days, 12.18% had shunt infections, and 17.88% had shunt revisions; for those who had subsequent gastrostomy tube placement within 11-30 days, shunt infections were seen in 10.57%, and shunt revisions in 19.41%; gastrostomy tube placement after one month or longer of shunt placement resulted in 15.39% of patients having shunt infections and 17.73% with shunt revision.

Objective To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality, and assess whether long-term AR and/or asthma medications affected the outcomes of COVID-19. Methods Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult participants completed SARS-Cov-2 testing between March 16 and December 31, 2020 in the UK Biobank were analyzed. The rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and mortality in relation to preexisting AR and/or asthma were assessed based on adjusted generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. Results AR patients of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-Cov-2 tests (RR:0.75, 95% CI: 0.69-0.81, p<0.001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.65-0.85, p<0.001) than females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, p<0.001). However, similar effects of asthma against COVID-19 hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 (RR:0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1, p=0.044) instead of elderlies.

Two reviewers independently completed the screening of literature, extraction of data, and quality assessment of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 software. Eventually, 29 RCTs involving 3060 patients and 28 retrospective studies (RSs) involving 12,460 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that TCM could decrease the proportion of patients progressing to severe cases by 55% and the mortality rate of severe or critical patients by 49%. Moreover, TCM could relieve clinical symptoms, curtail the length of hospital stay, improve laboratory indicators, and so on.

All positive-sense RNA viruses studied to date modify host membranes to help facilitate the sequestration of dsRNA from host defenses and concentrate replication factors to enhance RNA production. Flock House virus (FHV) is an attractive model for the study of these processes since it is well characterized and infects Drosophila cells, which are known to have a highly effective RNA silencing system. During infection, FHV modifies the outer membrane of host mitochondria to form numerous membrane invaginations, called spherules, that are 50 nm in diameter and known to be the site of viral RNA replication. While previous studies have outlined basic structural features of these invaginations, very little is known about the mechanism underlying their formation. Here we describe the optimization of an experimental system for the analysis of FHV host membrane modifications using crude mitochondrial preparations from infected Drosophila cells. These preparations can be programmed to synthesize both single- and double-stranded FHV RNA. The system was used to demonstrate that dsRNA is protected from nuclease digestion by virus-induced membrane invaginations and that spherules play an important role in stimulating RNA replication. Finally, we show that spherules generated during FHV infection appear to be dynamic as evidenced by their ability to form or disperse based on the presence or absence of RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is well established that positive-sense RNA viruses induce significant membrane rearrangements in infected cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these rearrangements, particularly membrane invagination and spherule formation, remain essentially unknown. How the formation of spherules enhances viral RNA synthesis is also not understood, although it is assumed to be partly a result of evading host defense pathways. To help interrogate some of these issues, we optimized a cell-free replication system consisting of mitochondria isolated from Flock House virus-infected Drosophila cells for use in biochemical and structural studies. Our data suggest that spherules generated during Flock House virus replication are dynamic, protect double-stranded RNA, and enhance RNA replication in general. Cryo-electron microscopy suggests that the samples are amenable to detailed structural analyses of spherules engaged in RNA synthesis.

Gusha, and Peter Lampe. This is followed by the reflections of a biblical scholar and a systematic theologian. From the perspective of a biblical scholar, the following issues are raised: the richness of biblical traditions, the influence of social location on the interpretation of the pandemic in the light of the Bible, the importance of the emphasis on lament, the reluctance to interpret the pandemic as a punishment from God, the importance of the interpreters view of God and the emphasis on the way in which the new normal should be approached. From the perspective of a systematic theologian the following issues are discussed: The nature of doing theology, the role of the symbol of the Divine, performativity of sense-making, the Trinitarian confession, an emerging new self and the importance of an ethic of responsibility. Contribution: The article is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasises the critical importance of engaging the Christian scripture. The role accorded to hermeneutics and to an explicit interdisciplinary conversation makes a particular contribution to the emerging crisis discourse. ? 2021. The Authors.

The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFN/ production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFN/ production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFN/ production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFN than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFN production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages. This study supports the hypothesis that a mannan-inhibitable lectin and CD200 are involved in virally induced type I IFN induction.","output":"The role of myeloid receptors on murine plasmacytoid dendritic cells in induction of type I interferon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Mankind has been ravaged by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since 2019. To date, we are still battling with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). Although children seem to experience milder symptoms with acute COVID19 illness, some are burdened by multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that classically observes a temporal relationship with COVID19. Methods: Clinical data retrieved from medical records and hospital electronic database with permission. Results: We report herein a 7-year-old incident dialysis patient with an atypical presentation of MIS-C. He had previously experienced recurrent peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis, which resulted in the removal of his tenckhoff catheter and was subsequently on chronic hemodialysis. He developed COVID-19 pneumonia after adults in the family caught the infection. The child experienced an uneventful recovery with nasal oxygen supplementation and a course of steroids. However, he developed gross abdominal distension approximately three weeks post COVID-19 which was not associated with fever or abdominal tenderness. A bedside ultrasound of the lungs suggested a normohydrated state with no signs of increased extravascular lung water. Simple ascites was demonstrated on ultrasound of the abdomen with a serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of less than 1.1g/dL and an ascitic protein of 48g/L. The sample had a normal fluid cytology and was negative for bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. Interestingly, our patient had remarkably high inflammatory markers ie C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 111 mg/L, Procalcitonin 7.47 ng/mL, D-Dimer >7.65 mcg/mL and Ferritin 1650 mcg/L despite the absence of fever. The liver enzymes and complete blood counts were unremarkable apart from transient reactive thrombocytosis. His echocardiogram showed minimal pericardial effusion and the absence of coronary arteries dilatation. In the light of his complex clinical presentation, temporal relation with recent COVID-19 and unexplained signs of hyperinflammation, he was treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin 2g/kg. Following that, we observed steady improvement of the inflammatory markers and resolution of the reactive ascites. At the time of writing, six weeks lapsed and he remained well on chronic hemodialysis. Conclusions: In conclusion, the exorbitantly high inflammatory markers and gross ascites otherwise unexplained by another disease proess could reflect an immune dysregulation post COVID-19 or an atypical presentation of MIS-C.

However, there was no detailed study on reference genes in different tissues of white clover under various abiotic stress conditions. Herein, 14 candidate reference genes (ACT7, ACT101, TUA1109, TUB, CYP, 60SrRNA, UBQ, E3, GAPDH1, GAPDH2, PP2A, BAM3, SAMDC, and ABC) were selected and analyzed by four programs (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). Samples were taken from two tissues (leaves and roots) under five different abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heat, cold, and heavy metal stress). Our results showed that 60SrRNA and ACT101 were the two top-ranked genes for all samples. Under various experimental conditions, the most stable gene was different; however, SAMDC, UBQ, 60SrRNA, and ACT101 were always top ranked. The most suitable reference genes should be selected according to different plant tissues and growth conditions.

Data from other medical specialties suggest high utilization of smartphones in routine clinical care. However, the ways in which these devices are used by neurologists for patient careCrelated activities are not well defined. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to characterize current patterns of smartphone use and perceptions of the utility of smartphones for patient careCrelated activities among academic neurology trainees and attending physicians. We also seek to characterize areas of need for future app development. METHODS: We developed a 31-item electronic questionnaire to address these questions and invited neurology trainees and attendings of all residency programs based in the United States to participate. We summarized descriptive statistics for respondents and specifically compared responses between trainees and attending physicians. RESULTS: We received 213 responses, including 112 trainee and 87 attending neurologist responses. Neurology trainees reported more frequent use of their smartphone for patient careCrelated activities than attending neurologists (several times per day: 84/112, 75.0% of trainees; 52/87, 59.8% of attendings; P=.03). The most frequently reported activities were internet use, calendar use, communication with other physicians, personal education, and health careCspecific app use. Both groups also reported regular smartphone use for the physical examination, with trainees again reporting more frequent usage compared with attendings (more than once per week: 35/96, 36.5% of trainees; 8/58, 13.8% of attendings; P=.03). Respondents used their devices most commonly for the vision, cranial nerve, and language portions of the neurologic examination. The majority of respondents in both groups reported their smartphones as very useful or essential for the completion of patient careCrelated activities (81/108, 75.0% of trainees; 50/83, 60.2% of attendings; P=.12). Neurology trainees reported a greater likelihood of using their smartphones in the future than attending neurologists (very likely: 73/102, 71.6% of trainees; 40/82, 48.8% of attendings; P=.005). The groups differed in their frequencies of device usage for specific patient careCrelated activities, with trainees reporting higher usage for most activities. Despite high levels of use, only 12 of 184 (6.5%) respondents reported ever having had any training on how to use their device for clinical care. Regarding future app development, respondents rated vision, language, mental status, and cranial nerve testing as potentially being the most useful to aid in the performance of the neurologic examination. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphones are used frequently and are subjectively perceived to be highly useful by academic neurologists. Trainees tended to use their devices more frequently than attendings. Our results suggest specific avenues for future technological development to improve smartphone use for patient careCrelated activities.

The present review summarizes the impact of COVID-19 on patients with underlying chronic liver diseases (CLD). Deferrals of all non-urgent activities in healthcare facilities, including a decrease in liver-clinic visits for patients with CLD, inadequate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, and postponement of liver transplant activities are the most important consequences. Delays in viral hepatitis elimination programs were also reported, leading to future development of advanced CLD and HCC. Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C without cirrhosis are not at risk for a more severe COVID-19 infection course. However, CHB status must be known in patients who are going to receive immunosuppression for preventing disease flare. In addition, checking for drug-drug interactions and potential hepatotoxicity reactions from agents administered to treat both SARS-CoV-2 and CLD are required. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease appeared to be at a high risk for severe COVID-19, even after adjustment for comorbidities. Patients with cirrhosis may develop decompensation, acute-on-chronic liver failure, or severe COVID-19.

CEACAM1 is expressed on the epithelium and in endothelial cells of a variety of tissues and hemopoietic cells, and functions as a homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecule. It is used as a receptor for some bacteria as well. The N terminal domain participates in mediating homophilic adhesion. This domain is also responsible for binding to the MHV spike (S) protein; the CC face protruding in this domain interacts with an N terminal region of the S protein composed of 330 amino acids (called S1N330).

As the hydrophobicity of apoA-I is considered important for its lipid transport, novel AMPs were designed and synthesized in this study by gradually increasing the hydrophobicity of the parent peptide and their anti-atherosclerotic effects were tested. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) with incrementally increased hydrophobicity were designed and synthesized by replacing the amino acids 221-240 of apoA-I (VLESFKVSFLSALEEYTKKL). Their effects on cholesterol efflux were evaluated. Their cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity were also measured. The in vitro mechanism of the action of the new peptides were explored. Adult apolipoprotein E-/- mice were used to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic activity of the best candidate, and the mechanistic basis of its anti-atherosclerotic effects were explored. KEY RESULTS: Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) were synthesized and their cholesterol efflux activity and cytotoxicity were closely related to their hydrophobicity. P12 (FLEKLKELLEHLKELLTKLL), as the best candidate, most strongly promoted cholesterol efflux among the non-toxic peptides (P1-P12). With its phospholipid affinity, P12 can effortlessly facilitate cholesterol transport through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. In vivo, P12 exhibited prominent anti-atherosclerotic activity via coupling with HDL. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: P12 featured proper hydrophobicity, which ensured its efficient binding with cytomembrane phospholipids, cholesterol, and HDL and provided a basis for its ability to reversely transport cholesterol and treat atherosclerosis.","output":"A novel apoA-I mimetic peptide suppresses atherosclerosis by promoting physiological HDL function in apoE-/- mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 containment measures hampered population cardiorespiratory fitness (which can be quantified as peak oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text] O(2peak))) and the possibility to assess it using laboratory-based techniques.

In this paper, a study of neutrosophic set significance on deep transfer learning models will be presented. The study will be conducted over a limited COVID-19 x-ray. The study relies on neutrosophic set and theory to convert the medical images from the grayscale spatial domain to the neutrosophic domain. The neutrosophic domain consists of three types of images, and they are the True (T) images, the Indeterminacy (I) images, and the Falsity (F) images. The dataset used in this research has been collected from different sources. The dataset is classified into four classes {COVID-19, normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus}. This study aims to review the effect of neutrosophic sets on deep transfer learning models. The selected deep learning models in this study are Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected as they have a small number of layers on their architectures. To test the performance of the conversion to the neutrosophic domain, more than 36 trials have been conducted and recorded. A combination of training and testing strategies by splitting the dataset into (90C10%, 80C20%, 70C30) is included in the experiments. Four domains of images are tested, and they are, the original domain, the True (T) domain, the Indeterminacy (I) domain, and the Falsity (F) domain.

To gain insight into the evolution and adaptation of TGEV, a comprehensive analysis of phylogeny and codon usage bias was performed. The phylogenetic analyses of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference displayed two distinct genotypes: genotypes I and II, and genotype I was classified into subtypes Ia and Ib. The compositional properties revealed that the coding sequence contained a higher number of A/U nucleotides than G/C nucleotides, and that the synonymous codon third position was A/U-enriched. The principal component analysis based on the values of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) showed the genotype-specific codon usage patterns. The effective number of codons (ENC) indicated moderate codon usage bias in the TGEV genome. Dinucleotide analysis showed that CpA and UpG were over-represented and CpG was under-represented in the coding sequence of the TGEV genome. The analyses of Parity Rule 2 plot, ENC-plot, and neutrality plot displayed that natural selection was the dominant evolutionary driving force in shaping codon usage preference in genotypes Ia and II. In addition, natural selection played a major role, while mutation pressure had a minor role in driving the codon usage bias in genotype Ib. The codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index (SiD) analyses suggested that genotype I might be more adaptive to pigs than genotype II.

METHOD: An online General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) survey was distributed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020) to doctors in primary and secondary care in the UK. Seven closed-ended questions were included in the questionnaire. Respondents were to indicate how frequently they experienced specific issues in the previous fortnight: Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; being unable to stop or control worrying; worrying too much generally; trouble relaxing; being so restless that it's hard to sit still; becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid of something awful happening. Participants were required to tick one of four choices for each of the seven parameters - not at all (0), several days (1), more than half the days (2) and nearly every day (3). A person with minimal or no anxiety will score less than 5. The survey was anonymous and circulated in professional online doctors' forums. Participation was voluntary and no incentives were given. RESULT: 273 completed surveys were received; 120 doctors were in primary care and 153 were in secondary care. Average GAD7 score was 6.4 in primary care and 7.9 in secondary care. 57% of primary care doctors and 66% of secondary care doctors reported score of 5 or more, representing at least mild anxiety symptoms. 22% doctors in primary care and 31% doctors in secondary care reported GAD7 score of 10 or more, indicating moderate to severe anxiety. One in ten doctors in both primary and secondary care reported severe anxiety due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The finding of more anxiety in secondary care doctors might be because general practitioners could resort early in the pandemic to remote consultations along with inadequacy of resources, greater exposure to suffering/deaths of patients and colleagues in hospital and perceived risk of catching COVID-19 infection. Results are limited due to relatively low numbers and it would be useful to replicate this study on a larger scale. Doctors are less likely to acknowledge their mental health difficulties due to stigma associated with mental health.

But as physical distancing ensues and all eyes remain fixed on the novel coronavirus, another, albeit careworn, pandemic rages on. Physical inactivity, the world's fourth leading cause of death, may indeed be exacerbated by physical distancing measures, such as sheltering at home and closing or limiting access to recreation and exercise facilities. The purpose of this paper is to urge public health and medical professionals not to forget the importance of physical activity to whole-person health, recognize the importance of physical activity as a potential COVID-19 mitigation strategy and to serve as advocates for promoting active lifestyles. It is imperative that the national call for physical distancing not be interpreted as a call for physical inactivity.","output":"Physical distancing  physical inactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online social media (OSM) has emerged as a prominent platform for debate on a wide range of issues. Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyze their tweets using text analysis. Using a community detection algorithm, we categorize these leaders into four clusters: research, news, health, and politics, with each cluster containing Twitter handles (accounts) of individual users or organizations. E.g., the health cluster includes the World Health Organization (@WHO), the Director-General of WHO (@DrTedros), and so on. The emotion analysis reveals that (i) all clusters show an equal amount of fear in their tweets, (ii) research and news clusters display more sadness than others, and (iii) health and politics clusters are attempting to win public trust. According to the text analysis, the (i) research cluster is more concerned with recognizing symptoms and the development of vaccination;(ii) news and politics clusters are mostly concerned with travel. We then show that we can use our findings to classify tweets into clusters with a score of 96% AUC ROC.","output":"Studying Leaders & Their Concerns Using Online Social Media During The Times Of Crisis -- A COVID Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-vaccination CNS demyelinating syndromes have been reported with a variety of vaccines including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines.

Using 70 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates, including the most recent sequences for the Korean and Chinese isolates, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the complete genome and the individual protein coding regions. The Korean MERS-CoV strain clustered in the previously established Hafr-Al-Batin-1_2013 clade together with two Saudi Arabian and one Chinese strain sampled in 2015. Although these four strains remained monophyletic in the entire protein-coding region, this clade showed different phylogenetic relationships across the genome, indicating a shared unique recombination pattern that is different from previously reported putative recombination strains.

We aimed to determine if delays to radical prostatectomy correlate with adverse outcomes using a contemporary population-based cohort of men diagnosed by transperineal biopsies. METHODS: This study analysed men with prostate cancer of the International Society for Urological Pathology grade group 2, diagnosed by transperineal prostate biopsies who underwent prostatectomy, using the prospectively data from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2018 Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria. Data were analysed according to stratified demographic and disease characteristics. Time intervals from biopsy (28, 60, 90, 120, and 270 days) were compared using odds ratios and regression analyses for proportion of upgrading, early biochemical recurrence, pT3 disease at prostatectomy, and positive surgical margins. RESULTS: In total, 2008 men were analysed. There were 306 (16.7%) men with upgrading, 151 (8.4%) with biochemical recurrence, 1068 (54.1%) with pT3 disease, and 464 (23.1%) with positive surgical margins (percentages excluded patients with missing data). All adverse outcomes studied were significantly associated with higher prostate-specific antigen and grade at diagnosis. Delays of 120C270 days did not adversely alter the incidence of Gleason upgrading, pT3, or recurrence. Delays (most frequent 60C89 days, 28%) were associated with positive surgical margins but not monotonically. Regression modelling demonstrated no increased likelihood of most adverse outcomes for up to 270 days. CONCLUSION: Men with prostate cancer of grade group 2 diagnosed through transperineal biopsy may wait up to 270 days for a prostatectomy without a greater likelihood of upgrading, pT3 disease, positive surgical margins, or biochemical recurrence.","output":"Impact of delay from transperineal biopsy to radical prostatectomy upon objective measures of cancer control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: How can we anticipate the progression of the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa. Methods: We downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https://covid19.who.int/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software. Results: We plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","output":"The Estimated Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers during the Ongoing Pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 12 Selected Countries outside China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Videogames use has constantly increased among children and adolescents, with uncertain consequences on their health.

While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony.","output":"Simple discrete-time self-exciting models can describe complex dynamic processes: A case study of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early evidence suggests that COVID-19 lockdown restrictions affect alcohol consumption. However, existing studies lack data on how drinking practices changed as restrictions disrupted people's work, family life and socializing routines. We examined changes in consumption and drinking occasion characteristics during three periods of changing restrictions in Scotland/England. DESIGN: Interrupted time-series analysis of repeat cross-sectional market research data (assessing step-level changes). SETTING: Scotland/England, January 2009-December 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Scotland: 41 507 adult drinkers; England: 253 148 adult drinkers. MEASUREMENTS: Three intervention points: March 2020 lockdown, July 2020 easing of restrictions and October 2020 re-introduction of some restrictions. PRIMARY OUTCOME: mean units consumed per week (total/off-trade/on-trade; 1 unit = 8 g ethanol). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: drinking > 14 units per week, heavy drinking, drinking days per week, solitary drinking, drinking with family/partners, drinking with friends/colleagues, own-home drinking, drinking in someone else's home and drinking start times. FINDINGS: In Scotland, March 2020's lockdown was associated with a 2.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61, 4.02] increase in off-trade (i.e. shop-bought) units per week, a -2.84 (95% CI = -3.63, -2.06) decrease in on-trade (i.e. licensed venues) units per week, but no statistically significant change in total units per week. July 2020's easing of restrictions was associated with a 1.33 (95% CI = 0.05, 2.62) increase in on-trade units per week, but no statistically significant total/off-trade consumption changes. October 2020's re-introduction of some restrictions was not associated with statistically significant consumption changes. Results for England were broadly similar. Lockdown restrictions were also associated with later drinking start times, fewer occasions in someone else's home and with friends/colleagues, more own-home drinking and (in Scotland only) more solitary drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in on-trade alcohol consumption following COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in Scotland/England in 2020 were mainly offset by increased own-home drinking. This largely persisted in periods of greater/lesser restrictions. The shift towards off-trade drinking involved significant changes in the characteristics of drinking occasions.","output":"The impact of changes in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on alcohol consumption and drinking occasion characteristics in Scotland and England in 2020: an interrupted time-series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Bioinformatics is a multi-disciplinary field that usually uses approaches in Computer Science such as algorithms and machine learning to solve problems in the domains of Biology, Biochemistry, and other domains involving molecular biology data.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The cobas SARS-CoV-2 dual-target reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay, licensed for respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, was validated for detection of viral RNA in blood. For the validation panel, SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples were prepared by spiking SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens in negative human plasma. The 95% limit of detection (LOD95) was determined by probit analysis. For clinical validation, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and patients with COVID-19 with a severe disease course treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) were included. RESULTS: The validation of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for blood demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and intra- and inter-assay precision and efficiency. The LOD95 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 5.0 genome copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-12 copies/mL) for target 1 and 4.3 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 2.9-10 copies/mL) for target 2.

The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD patients' management were assessed in our Tertiary Gastroenterology Center in Bucharest, Romania. METHODS: Medical records of IBD patients admitted between 15th of March and 15th of August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to a control cohort of consecutive IBD patients admitted to our unit during the corresponding period of 2019. RESULTS: There was a highly significant shift towards one-day hospitalization during the referral period in 2020 for IBD cases (91% in 2020 vs 82.2% in 2019, p=0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the distribution of patient's gender, IBD phenotype or newly diagnosed IBD cases. A significantly lower proportion of admitted patients received 5-aminosalicylic acid (29% vs 41.2%, p=0.0001), whereas a substantially higher number of patients were prescribed biological therapy in 2020 in comparison to the corresponding 2019-time frame (79.5% vs 57.9%, p<0.0001).

RESULTS: For most of the participants the access to digital health services was hampered by insufficient digital, and / or local language skills. The lack of support and training, poor health, as well as the lack of strong e-identification or suitable devices also prevented the access. Digital services were not perceived to be applicable for all situations or capable of replacing face-to-face services due to the poor communication in the digital environment. Fears and the lack of trust regarding digital platforms were expressed as well as concerns related to the security of the services. Contact with a health care professional was also considered less personal and more prone to misunderstandings in the digital environment than in face-to-face services. Finally, digital alternatives were not always available as desired by participants, or participants were unaware of existing digital services and their value. CONCLUSION: Several development needs in the implementation of digital health services were identified that could improve equal access to and benefits gained from digital services in the future. While digital health services are increasing, traditional face-to-face services will still need to be offered alongside the digital ones to ensure equal access to services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced the U.S. population to the essential worker. This is a novel category of worker designated by the state as essential to the functioning of the country's vital infrastructure. Their occupations range from professional roles in healthcare and IT to low-wage jobs like store clerks, meatpackers, and farmworkers. In California, from where I write, 14 percent of the state's recognized essential workforce lives in poverty, and although many of these workers serve as a literal lifeline during the pandemic, many have had to go without protective equipment and basic worker protections like access to sick days and health benefits. This article offers an account of the relationship between \\"essential\\" and the category of labor by examining how reproductivity, as the foundation to all work, life, and sociality, is, as Kalindi Vora argues, rendered into racialized surplus, a condition of devaluation and disposability premised on the extraction and exhaustion of life.","output":"Essentially Surplus: The Struggle for the California Domestic Worker Bill of Rights (AB 241) and the Afterlife of Reproductive Slavery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latina women and other ethnic and racial groups continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including public health.

Two independent researchers performed the search and study screening. A descriptive analysis was carried out considering the study design of the included studies. Sources PubMed, SCOPUS, and Preprint platforms (bioRxiv and medRxiv). Study selection We included 55 reports from PubMed and SCOPUS. Nine articles were letters to the editors, 21 were in vitro studies, 16 were literature reviews, and 9 were classified as other study designs. We included 37 preprints. Two articles were letters to the editors, 24 were in vitro studies, 3 were literature reviews, and 8 were classified as other study designs. In general, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited and most promising. However, there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of N95 respirator decontamination.

Given its overexpression at sites of inflammation in a wide range of diseases marked by increasingly oxidative cellular environment, a comprehensive structural understanding of how cellular redox conditions may impact the structure and function of MIF is necessary. We used solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate structural and dynamic signatures of MIF under varied solution redox conditions. Our results indicate that the MIF structure is modified and becomes increasingly dynamic in an oxidative environment, which may be a means to alter the MIF functional response in a redox-dependent manner. We identified latent allosteric sites within MIF that are redox-sensitive and mutational analysis reveals that loss of redox-responsive residues attenuates activation of the coreceptor CD74. Leveraging sites of redox-sensitivity therefore reveals an avenue to modulate MIF function in its disease state via structure-based drug design.","output":"Redox-dependent Structure and Dynamics of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Reveal Sites of Latent Allostery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crystal structure of the organic pigment 2-monomethyl-quinacridone (Pigment Red 192, C21H14N2O2) was solved from X-ray powder diffraction data.

The resulting imbalance between inflammatory and resolving transcriptional programs can cause an overabundance of pro-inflammatory, classically activated macrophage type 1 (M1) and/or helper T cell type 1 (Th1) products, such as IFN?3, TNF&#945;, IL1-?, and IL12, that prevent immune switching to resolution and healing. The low molecular weight fraction of human serum albumin (LMWF5A) is a novel biologic drug that is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of osteoarthritis and the hyper-inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms of action involved with the ability of LMWF5A to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine release. METHODS: ELISA arrays were used to identify cytokines and chemokines influenced by LMWF5A treatment of LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The resulting profiles were analyzed by gene enrichment to gain mechanistic insight into the biologic processes and transcription factors (TFs) underlying the identified differentially expressed cytokines. DNA-binding ELISAs, luciferase reporter assays, and TNF&#945; or IL-1? relative potency were then employed to confirm the involvement of enriched pathways and TFs. RESULTS: LMWF5A was found to significantly inhibit a distinct set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF&#945;, IL-1?, IL-12, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) associated with pro-inflammatory M1/Th1 immune profiles. Gene enrichment analysis also suggests these cytokines are, in part, regulated by NF-&#954;B and STAT transcription factors. Data from DNA-binding and reporter assays support this with LMWF5A inhibition of STAT1&#945; DNA-binding activity as well as a reduction in overall NF-&#954;B-driven luciferase expression. Experiments using antagonists specific for the immunomodulatory and NF-&#954;B/STAT-repressing transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)?3 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), indicate these pathways are involved in the LMWF5A mechanisms of action by reducing LMWF5A drug potency as measured by TNF&#945; and IL-1? release. CONCLUSION: In this report, we provide evidence that LMWF5A reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine release by activating the immunoregulatory transcription factors PPAR?3 and AhR. In addition, our data indicate that LMWF5A suppresses NF-&#954;B and STAT1&#945; pro-inflammatory pathways. This suggests that LMWF5A acts through these mechanisms to decrease pro-inflammatory transcription factor activity and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production.","output":"LMWF5A suppresses cytokine release by modulating select inflammatory transcription factor activity in stimulated PBMC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through deterministic data linkage of health registries, mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths was measured in 1,880,351 older adults.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of older medical cannabis users including the indications, type and amount of cannabis used, perceived changes in symptoms after cannabis use, change in dose of concurrent medications, and adverse effects. METHODS: Data were collected between October 2014 and October 2020 from patients who were consulting the Canada-wide network of clinics of a medical cannabis provider and who were willing to answer questionnaires based on their medical status. The current study included older adults ( 65 years) who completed questionnaires at intake and first follow-up visits. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics, which were compared between men and women with t tests or chi-squared tests. Tests of proportions assessed categorical responses for perceived effects after cannabis use. Logistic regression was used to assess trends in cannabis usage. RESULTS: Data included that from 9766 older adult users at intake (mean  SD age = 73.2  6.8 years, females = 60.0%), among whom 4673 (females = 61.4%) returned for follow-up after 90.6  58 days. The most common primary indication for which medical cannabis was sought was pain (67.7%), which was more common in women, whereas oncological and neurological conditions were more common in men. At follow-up, cannabis oil was used by 81.0% of older adults, among whom compositions containing only or mostly cannabidiol (CBD) had been used by 83.6%. Adverse effects reported by older adults at the follow-up visit included dry mouth (12.8%), drowsiness (8.6%), and dizziness (4.0%). The majority of older adults reported improvements in pain (72.7%, z = 1482.6, p < 0.0001, compared to worsening or no change), sleep (64.5%, z = 549.4, p < 0.0001), and mood (52.8%, z = 16.4, p < 0.0001), with 35.6% reporting use of a reduced dose of opioids and 19.9% a reduced dose of benzodiazepines. INTERPRETATION: Among older adults, medical cannabis is used more often by women, with CBD-containing cannabis oils being the most commonly used.

Furthermore, it was unclear if students stress levels were related to their preference for one learning modality over another. The purpose of this study was thus to explore associations between lecture modality (synchronous Zoom lectures versus live, in-person lectures) and stress in second-year medical students after they transitioned from a face-to-face learning experience to a fully online lecture platform. Methodology: Cross-sectional data were collected from 112 second-year medical students enrolled in a large U.S. medical school using an anonymous questionnaire delivered electronically via social media and emails. The survey contained items pertaining to students attitudes towards different types of lecture modalities and how they relate to personal stress. Descriptive data and Spearmans rank correlation tests were conducted using IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.

RESULTS: The use of G\\\\CSFs, ESAs, or RBC transfusions on/after week 5 was significantly lower among patients receiving trilaciclib versus placebo (28.5% vs. 56.3%, p < 0.0001; 3.3% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.0254; and 14.6% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.0252, respectively). Compared with placebo, trilaciclib significantly reduced DSN and SN, irrespective of G\\\\CSF administration. RBC transfusions and ESAs were most often administered in patients with grade 3/4 anemia; however, patients typically received RBC transfusions over ESA administration. CONCLUSIONS: By improving CIM and reducing the need for associated supportive care, trilaciclib has the potential to reduce the burden of myelosuppression on patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy for the treatment of ES\\\\SCLC.

To examine associations between these periods of quarantine and mental health, including suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm, we examined data from a national survey of 3000 Canadian adults distributed between May 14-29, 2020. Notably, participants provided the reason(s) for quarantine. When pooling all reasons for quarantine together, this experience was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm in the two weeks preceding the survey. These associations remained even after controlling for age, household income, having a pre-existing mental health condition, being unemployed due to the pandemic, and living alone. However, the associations with mental health differed across reasons for quarantine; those who were self-isolating specifically due to recent travel were not found to have higher odds of suicidal ideation or deliberate self-harm. Our research suggests the importance of accounting for the reason(s) for quarantine in the implementation of this critical public health measure to reduce the mental health impacts of this experience.","output":"Associations between periods of COVID-19 quarantine and mental health in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The traditional nonsurgical accommodative treatment for diabetes-associated Charcot foot arthropathy has been unsuccessful in improving the quality of life in affected individuals. This has led to the growing interest in surgical correction of the acquired deformity with either \\"super construct\\" internal fixation implants or fine-wire static circular external fixation. The use of static circular external fixation without implants has been demonstrated to achieve high rates of deformity correction with low complication rates. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of pin site infection in this high-risk patient population. METHODS Over an 11-year period, 283 consecutive diabetic patients underwent single-stage correction of Charcot foot deformity with static fine-wire circular external fixation and no internal fixation devices. Pin care was minimal. RESULTS Fifty-nine (20.8%) patients developed clinical signs of pin tract infection in at least 1 pin site. Forty-nine occurred in patients undergoing surgical correction of deformity in the foot. Eight occurred in patients undergoing surgical correction at the ankle level and 2 in patients undergoing complex reconstruction for combined foot and ankle deformity. Higher rates of pin site infections were observed in patients with osteomyelitis present at the time of surgery (25.6%) as compared with patients without evidence of infection (17.8%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .1184). There was no correlation between body mass index and pin site infection (P = .288). There was a statistically significant trend (P < .05) for higher rates of pin site infection in patients with elevated hemoglobin A1C levels. Erythema and drainage resolved in all patients with local pin care and empiric oral antibiotic therapy. None of the wires were removed prematurely, and all infections resolved following removal of the circular external fixator at the scheduled time for removal. CONCLUSIONS Pin site infection was common following surgical correction of the acquired deformity associated with Charcot foot. These acquired pin site infections were a nuisance but did not appear to add permanent morbidity or require additional surgery to resolve.

Pharmacological targeting of the nucleolin RNA binding domain RBD1,2 can inhibit RSV infections in vitro and in vivo; however, the site(s) on RBD1,2 which interact with RSV are not known. We undertook a series of experiments designed to: document RSV-nucleolin co-localization on the surface of polarized MDCK cells using immunogold electron microscopy, to identify domains on nucleolin that physically interact with RSV using biochemical methods and determine their biological effects on RSV infection in vitro, and to carry out structural analysis toward informing future RSV drug development. Results of immunogold transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed RSV-nucleolin co-localization on the cell surface, as would be expected for a viral receptor. RSV, through its fusion protein (RSV-F), physically interacts with RBD1,2 and these interactions can be competitively inhibited by treatment with Palivizumab or recombinant RBD1,2. Treatment with synthetic peptides derived from two 12-mer domains of RBD1,2 inhibited RSV infection in vitro, with structural analysis suggesting these domains are potentially feasible for targeting in drug development.

MAIN BODY: Emerging novel COVID-19 is a global health emergency on a pandemic scale that represents a terror to human health through its ability to escape anti-viral measures. Such viral infections impose a great socioeconomic burden, besides global health challenges. This imposes a pressing need for the development of anti-viral therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools that demonstrate multifunctional, target-specific, and non-toxic properties. Nanotheranostics is regarded as a promising approach for the management of different viral infections. Nanotheranostics facilitates targeted drug-delivery of anti-viral therapeutics as well as contributing to the development of diagnostic systems. Multifunctional metallic nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as innovative theranostic agents that enable sustainable treatment and effective diagnosis. Here we have reviewed current advances in the use of theranostic metallic NPs to fight against COVID-19, and discussed the application as well as limitations associated with nanotechnology-based theranostic approaches. CONCLUSION: This review verified the potential use of some metal-based NPs as anti-viral nanotheranostic agents. Metal-based NPs could act as carriers that enable the sustainable and targeted delivery of active anti-viral molecules, or as diagnostic agents that allow rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viral infections.","output":"A proposed insight into the anti-viral potential of metallic nanoparticles against novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 leads to an increasing demand for online educational resources to continue teaching and learning.

In this context, this paper posits a comparative analysis of the above-described methods of stress detection and accentuates on stress detection methodology using EEG signals, as EEG is a perfect non-invasive tool, widely used in clinical and research domains. The fractal dimension (FD) method, which is an indicator of curve irregularities, has been used in the detection of stress for feature extraction, applying three FD algorithms viz. Higuchi, Katz and Permutation Entropy. For classification, this study aims to apply and compare a number of classic machine learning algorithms based on accuracy, precision and sensitivity.

As a result, some organizations allow their employees to respond to external emergencies by engaging in response actions for a limited time, like in the case of emergency response teams. The latter teams consist of employees that act as emergency response officers who can respond to floods, train crashes, or other emergencies. Emergency response teams constitute an example of so-called latent organizing (LO) in the preparation for and response to any (unpredictable) future emergency. While latent organizing is ubiquitous in a societal and professional sense, it has hardly been studied in the organization design literature. In this paper, we develop a research agenda for studying LO. LO serves to prepare for and respond to emergencies, but otherwise remains largely dormant and inactive. When it is inactive, host organizations use the LOs human and other resources for their own gainful purposes. Resources for LO are thus organized in a quasi-permanent fashion, one that is rather latent until activated by an emergency. We further develop the construct of latency to explore how effective LO can be designed and facilitated.

Respiratory depression was defined as episodes of apnea, hypopnea, hypoxemia, pain-sedation mismatch, unplanned positive airway pressure device application, or naloxone administration in the post-anesthesia care unit. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association with clinical characteristics. From 1,974 hysterectomies, 253 had postoperative respiratory depression, yielding an incidence of 128 (95% confidence interval, 114-144) per 1,000 surgeries.

This article describes the study design and methods being used to conduct a systems-level analysis of public health preparedness in the province of Alberta, Canada. The project is being funded under the Health Research Fund, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. METHODS/DESIGN: We use an embedded, multiple-case study design, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to measure empirically the degree of inter-organizational coordination existing among public health agencies in Alberta, Canada. We situate our measures of inter-organizational network ties within a systems-level framework to assess the relative influence of inter-organizational ties, individual organizational attributes, and institutional environmental features on public health preparedness. The relative contribution of each component is examined for two potential public health threats: pandemic influenza and West Nile virus. DISCUSSION: The organizational dimensions of public health preparedness depend on a complex mix of individual organizational characteristics, inter-agency relationships, and institutional environmental factors. Our study is designed to discriminate among these different system components and assess the independent influence of each on the other, as well as the overall level of public health preparedness in Alberta.

We are interested in what benefits facemasks could offer as a non-pharmaceutical intervention, especially in the settings where high-technology interventions, such as contact tracing using mobile apps or rapid case detection via molecular tests, are not sustainable. Here, we report the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our intention is to provide a simple modelling framework to examine the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics when facemasks are worn by the public, with or without imposed lock-down periods. Our results are illustrated for a number of plausible values for parameter ranges describing epidemiological processes and mechanistic properties of facemasks, in the absence of current measurements for these values. We show that, when facemasks are used by the public all the time (not just from when symptoms first appear), the effective reproduction number, R(e), can be decreased below 1, leading to the mitigation of epidemic spread. Under certain conditions, when lock-down periods are implemented in combination with 100% facemask use, there is vastly less disease spread, secondary and tertiary waves are flattened and the epidemic is brought under control. The effect occurs even when it is assumed that facemasks are only 50% effective at capturing exhaled virus inoculum with an equal or lower efficiency on inhalation. Facemask use by the public has been suggested to be ineffective because wearers may touch their faces more often, thus increasing the probability of contracting COVID-19. For completeness, our models show that facemask adoption provides population-level benefits, even in circumstances where wearers are placed at increased risk. At the time of writing, facemask use by the public has not been recommended in many countries, but a recommendation for wearing face-coverings has just been announced for Scotland. Even if facemask use began after the start of the first lock-down period, our results show that benefits could still accrue by reducing the risk of the occurrence of further COVID-19 waves. We examine the effects of different rates of facemask adoption without lock-down periods and show that, even at lower levels of adoption, benefits accrue to the facemask wearers. These analyses may explain why some countries, where adoption of facemask use by the public is around 100%, have experienced significantly lower rates of COVID-19 spread and associated deaths. We conclude that facemask use by the public, when used in combination with physical distancing or periods of lock-down, may provide an acceptable way of managing the COVID-19 pandemic and re-opening economic activity. These results are relevant to the developed as well as the developing world, where large numbers of people are resource poor, but fabrication of home-made, effective facemasks is possible. A key message from our analyses to aid the widespread adoption of facemasks would be: my mask protects you, your mask protects me.","output":"A modelling framework to assess the likely effectiveness of facemasks in combination with lock-down in managing the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current era, information dissemination is more convenient, the harm of rumors is more serious than ever.

Organic farming is a potential way to reduce environmental impacts by excluding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from the process. Despite ecological benefits, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without additional support and incentives from consumers. This study models the interplay between consumer preferences and socio-environmental issues related to agriculture and food production. We operationalize the novel concept of extended agro-food supply chain and simulate adaptive behavior of farmers, food processors, retailers, and customers. Not only the operational factors (e.g., price, quantity, and lead time), but also the behavioral factors (e.g., attitude, perceived control, social norms, habits, and personal goals) of the food suppliers and consumers are considered in order to foster organic farming. We propose an integrated approach combining agent-based, discrete-event, and system dynamics modeling for a case of wine supply chain. Findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model over the traditional sustainable supply chain models in incorporating the feedback between consumers and producers and analyzing management scenarios that can urge farmers to expand organic agriculture. Results further indicate that demand-side participation in transition pathways towards sustainable agriculture can become a time-consuming effort if not accompanied by the middle actors between consumers and farmers.

Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","output":"Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"E-Lifestyles are individual forms of behavior in the digital environment that reflect the values, activities, interests, and opinions of consumers. Likewise, fitness Apps are considered technological tools for promoting physical activity online. Although there are studies related to sports lifestyles, it has not been analyzed yet how e-lifestyles are related to the use of fitness Apps. Based on this, this study represents a step to clarify how e-lifestyles influence different relationships with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, and intentions to use Fitness Apps. Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between the e-lifestyles of consumers of Boutique fitness centers and their relationship with the perceived ease of use, the perceived usefulness, the attitude, and the intention to use Fitness Apps. The sample was 591 customers (378 women and 213 men) of 25 Boutique fitness centers. An online questionnaire was used for data collection. Data was analyzed with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model. Findings provide an insight into the importance of e-lifestyles in the intention of using fitness Apps and therefore in promoting physical activity through online fitness services. The results showed positive relationships between e-lifestyles, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude toward fitness Apps. Finally, the attitude toward fitness Apps offered a very high predictive value on use intention. This study provides a better understanding of consumers intention to use fitness Apps. The conclusions and recommendations for sports managers of fitness centers highlight the importance of e-lifestyles as a predecessor for the use of fitness Apps.","output":"The Promotion of Physical Activity from Digital Services: Influence of E-Lifestyles on Intention to Use Fitness Apps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New delivery systems aim to increase vaccine potency and reduce side effects.","output":"Better lipids to power next generation of mRNA vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of majority rule and respect for minority rights is demonstrated in several constitutions of the world Oppression by the majority of the minority is barred by articles of these respective constitutions Today, democracy is mostly a method of government of the people that is ruled by the people The issue of minority rights is at the center of the concept of civic rights Minority protection, thus, operates on the hypothesis that religious, cultural, and linguistic affiliations are essential features of the very notion of a civic, just society This paper offers an alternative account of why minority rights have international significance and more information on the value of an international, socially just process for the allocation of resources by states By this approach, international minority rights speak to the wrongs that international law itself produces by organizing international political reality into a legal order This article focuses on the uncertain effect of religious autonomy in India and the outcome of democracy in the country While the Indian constitution guarantees autonomy to its religious minorities and promises minorities their freedoms, Indian democracy, which was once considered remarkable in scale and duration, has been weakened by the rise of xenophobic nationalism and threats to religious minorities Even the safety and religious freedom of minorities have been compromised during COVID-19 In the last few decades, these trends have been clear;however, they have dramatically increased in the last few years, and the administration has turned a blind eye","output":"Protecting the Rights of Minorities under International Law and Implications of COVID-19: An Overview of the Indian Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 challenges world governments.

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuates in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.","output":"Angiotensin II receptors: Impact for COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The historically unprecedented slump in overall economic output due to the coronavirus crisis creates an urgency for economic policy responses Demandside measures must be timely, targeted, and temporary Addressing policy objectives beyond the economic recovery should not be the focus right now A package of measures ranging from tax cuts to direct payments is appropriate","output":"[Investment and Consumption: Economic Policy Options in Mid-2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some new [3-(4-phenyl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl](pyridine-4-yl)methanones and 3-substituted phenyl-5-substituted phenyl-4,5-dihydro-pyrazole-1-carbothioamides have been synthesized employing microwave techniques and evaluated for antimicrobial activity.

In addition, the recent COVID-19 outbreak has been creating challenges for various countries and their respective health care organizations in managing and controlling the pandemic. One of the most important observations during the recent outbreak is the lack of effective eHealth frameworks for managing and controlling pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to review the current National eHealth Strategy of Saudi Arabia and to propose an integrated eHealth framework that can be effective for managing health care operations and services during pandemics. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was administered to 316 health care professionals to review the current national eHealth framework of Saudi Arabia and identify the objectives, factors, and components that are key for managing and controlling pandemics. Purposive sampling was used to collect responses from diverse experts, including physicians, technical experts, nurses, administrative experts, and pharmacists. The survey was administered at five hospitals in Saudi Arabia by forwarding the survey link using a web-based portal. A sample population of 350 was achieved, which was filtered to exclude incomplete and ineligible samples, giving a sample of 316 participants. RESULTS: Of the 316 participants, 187 (59.2%) found the current eHealth framework to be ineffective, and more than 50% of the total participants stated that the framework lacked some essential components and objectives. Additional components and objectives focusing on using eHealth for managing information, creating awareness, increasing accessibility and reachability, promoting self-management and self-collaboration, promoting electronic services, and extensive stakeholder engagement were considered to be the most important factors by more than 80% of the total participants.

We sought to characterize clinical research activity during the recent influenza A pandemic and to understand the experiences, beliefs, and practices of key stakeholders involved in pandemic research implementation. DESIGN Cross-sectional, provincial postal questionnaire. SETTING Level III ICUs. PARTICIPANTS ICU administrators and research coordinators. MEASUREMENTS We used rigorous survey methodology to identify potential respondents and to develop, test, and administer two-related questionnaires. MAIN RESULTS We analyzed responses from 39 research coordinators and 139 administrators (response rates: 70.9% and 73.2%, respectively). Compared with non-influenza A studies, influenza A studies were less likely to be randomized trials and most often investigator-initiated and peer-review funded. Whereas both respondent groups felt that pandemic research would be helpful in providing care during future pandemics, research coordinators placed significantly greater importance on their ICU's participation in pandemic research. Both respondent groups expressed a need for rapid approval processes, designated funding for research personnel, adequate funding for start-up and patient screening, preapproved template protocols and consent forms, and clearer guidance regarding co-enrollment. Research coordinators acknowledged a need for alternative consent models to increase their capacity to participate in future pandemic research. More administrators expressed willingness to participate in the next pandemic if the required research resources were made available to them.

We examined chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, pulmonary function, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Among 81 enrolled patients, 62 (77%) patients and 61 (75%) patients, respectively, completed 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Abnormal CT findings were still present in 73% of patients at 1 month and 54% at 3 months, whereas chest CT scan scores improved progressively at 1-month (5.0  5.1) and 3-month follow up (3.0  4.5) compared with that during hospitalization (11  6.8). Mild restrictive pulmonary impairment was detected in 11% and 10% of patients at 1-month and 3-month follow up, respectively. The 6MWD was 523  77 m in male patients and 484  58 m in female patients, which was significantly lower than in healthy controls (606  68 m, 568  78 m, p < 0.001). SF-36 scores were significantly impaired in the domains of role physical (RP), role emotional (RE), and social functioning (SF) compared with the normal age-matched population. RP was improved at 3-month compared with 1-month follow up in the 41-64 years group (p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that older age (over 40 years) and steroid administration during hospitalization were independently associated with worse chest CT scores at 3-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months, chest CT abnormalities were present in one half of COVID-19 survivors and worse chest CT scores were independently associated with older age and steroid administration during hospitalization. Residual pulmonary function impairments were modest, whereas exercise capacity and SF-36 scores were significantly lower than the general population.

Indeed, the pandemic has highlighted some hurdles that need to be addressed in the system in order to streamline the regulatory processes and be in a situation where life-saving pharmaceutical solutions such as vaccines can be delivered quickly and equitably to people across the globe. More precisely, trade-offs had to be made between the need for regulatory flexibility in the requirements for manufacturing and controls to enable rapid availability of large volumes of vaccines vs the increased stringency and the lack of harmonization in the regulatory environment for vaccines globally. It is also characterized by a high heterogeneity in terms of review and approval processes, limiting equitable and timely access.

We find that trust in scientists is the key driving force behind individual support for and compliance with NPIs and for favorable attitudes toward vaccination. The effect of trust in government is more ambiguous and tends to diminish support for and compliance with NPIs in countries where the recommendations from scientists and the government were not aligned. Trust in others also has seemingly paradoxical effects: in countries where social trust is high, the support for NPIs is low due to higher expectations that others will voluntary social distance. Our individual-level longitudinal data also allows us to evaluate the effects of within-person changes in trust over the pandemic: we show that trust levels and, in particular, trust in scientists have changed dramatically for individuals and within countries, with important subsequent effects on compliant behavior and support for NPIs.

Out of all survey participants who wrote at least one comment (n = 3547), 28% described one or more experiences of mistreatment. Six of the seven types of mistreatment listed in Bohren and colleagues' typology of mistreatment during childbirth were found, the most frequent of which were ineffective communication and lack of informed consent. Five further themes were identified in the interviews: informal coercion, risk factors for mistreatment, consequences of mistreatment, examples of good care, and what's needed to improve maternity care. Conclusion The findings from this study show that experiences of mistreatment are a reality in Swiss maternity care and give insight into women's individual experiences as well as how these affect them during and after childbirth. This study emphasises the need to respect women's autonomy in order to prevent mistreatment and empower women to actively participate in decisions. Both individual and systemic efforts are required to prevent mistreatment and guarantee respectful, dignified, and high-quality maternity care for all.","output":"\\"We felt like part of a production system\\": a qualitative study on women's experience of mistreatment during childbirth in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a threatening risk for global public health. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately screen patients with COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, a total of 1658 patients with COVID-19 and 1027 patients of CAP underwent thin-section CT. All images were preprocessed to obtain the segmentations of both infections and lung fields, which were used to extract location-specific features. An infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) was proposed, in which subjects were automated categorized into groups with different ranges of infected lesion sizes, followed by random forests in each group for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded sensitivity of 0.907, specificity of 0.833, and accuracy of 0.879 under five-fold cross-validation. Large performance margins against comparison methods were achieved especially for the cases with infection size in the medium range, from 0.01% to 10%. The further inclusion of Radiomics features show slightly improvement.

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: ? in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; ? in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Special precautions should be taken and procedures followed when performing invasive medical procedures in endoscopic laboratories in patients with specific or clinically probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

More and more research demonstrates that mutations in the genes encoding aaRSs lead to the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as incurable CharcotCMarieCTooth disease (CMT) and distal spinal muscular atrophy. Some mutations result in the loss of tRNA aminoacylation activity, while other mutants retain their classical enzyme activity. In the latter case, disease manifestations are associated with additional neuron-specific functions of aaRSs.

However, illite has low bioactivity due to its low solubility and electron-donating ability in aqueous solutions. Therefore, we aimed to develop polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized illite microparticles (P-lite MPs) via polymer adsorption on illite surfaces. An increasing amount of PVP was used to coat a fixed amount of illite to prepare P-lite MPs of different hydrodynamic diameters in the range of 4C9 m. These sizes were maintained for 2 weeks during storage in a biological buffer without any noticeable changes. The stabilization of illite microparticles using a hydrophilic PVP polymer improved their aqueous dispersity and free radical-scavenging activity. Since the large surface area of microparticles provides several sites for interactions, the smallest P-lite MP exhibited the highest antioxidant and antibacterial activities. More importantly, the MPs showed effective free radical-scavenging activity in vitro without any cytotoxicity. Therefore, P-lite MPs with improved bioavailability may represent a suitable bioactive material for various industrial and biomedical applications.","output":"A Novel Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Stabilized Illite Microparticle with Enhanced Antioxidant and Antibacterial Effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19 widespread flooding all over the world, the entire medical practice as well as medical education has been effected by this pandemic spread.

A total of 240 Pekin ducks were used, and they were reared until slaughter age (42a?d) in three different stocking density groups (three, five and seven ducklingsa?m - 2 ). To compare the slaughter performance of the ducklings' live weight, carcass weight, carcass yield, thigh and breast meat weight and yield, and edible giblet weight (heart, liver and gizzard) were investigated. The meat quality was compared between the treatment groups based on dry matter ratio, cooking loss, water-holding capacity, pH values, and colour parameters ( L , a , b , c , h and  E values). Carcass weight, carcass yield, thigh and breast meat weight were found to decrease in parallel to the increasing stocking density, resulting in a reduction in thigh and breast meat weights and ratios ( P < 0.05 ). Increasing the stocking density decreased the heart weight and positively improved the liver and gizzard ratio ( P < 0.05 ). However, it did not affect the meat quality parameters investigated in this research ( P < 0.05 ). The breast meat of the ducks reared under higher stocking density had higher L , h and  E values, lower a value ( P < 0.05 ), and similar b and c values ( P < 0.05 ).

In this study, we describe the inflammatory profile in CCM and show for the first time the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in rodents and humans with CCM. Through RNA-seq analysis of cerebellum endothelial cells from wild-type mice and mice with an endothelial cell-specific ablation of the Ccm3 gene (Ccm3(iECKO)), we show that endothelial cells from Ccm3(iECKO) mice have an increased expression of inflammation-related genes. These genes encode proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as adhesion molecules, which promote recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells. Similarly, immunoassays showed elevated levels of these cytokines and chemokines in the cerebellum of the Ccm3(iECKO) mice. Consistently, both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis showed infiltration of different subsets of leukocytes into the CCM lesions. Neutrophils, which are known to fight against infection through different strategies, including the formation of NETs, represented the leukocyte subset within the most pronounced increase in CCM. Here, we detected elevated levels of NETs in the blood and the deposition of NETs in the cerebral cavernomas of Ccm3(iECKO) mice. Degradation of NETs by DNase I treatment improved the vascular barrier. The deposition of NETs in the cavernomas of patients with CCM confirms the clinical relevance of NETs in CCM.

For healthcare professionals strike action poses a unique dilemma. Perhaps most fundamentally, as strike action is designed to be disruptive it has the potential to impact the delivery of care and place patient well-being in jeopardy. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of healthcare strike action on patient mortality outcomes globally using meta-analysis in order to provide a comprehensive evidence base that can advise healthcare professionals, governments and regulatory bodies on the impact that strike action has on patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive literature search of major electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, BIOETHICSLINE, EconLit, WEB OF SCIENCE, OPEN GREY and SIGMA REPOSITORY) will be undertaken to identify observational studies of strike action among healthcare professionals where in-hospital/clinic and population/community mortality is examined, prestrike, during and poststrike. Meta-analysis will be performed to estimate in-hospital/clinic and population/community mortality during periods of strike action. The quality of evidence will be assessed using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies.

Using the same variation in unanticipated projected cases, we find that COVID-19-related losses in market value at the firm level rise with capital intensity and leverage, and are deeper in industries more conducive to disease transmission. These relationships provide important insight into current record job losses. Measuring US states' drops in market value as the employment weighted average declines of the industries they produce, we find that states with milder drops in market value exhibit larger initial jobless claims per worker.

However, there is no quantitative information about the effect of colds on the lung function of infants with RW. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of common cold on forced expiratory parameters measured from raised lung volume in infants with RW. METHODS: Spirometric lung function (expiratory flows from raised lung volume) was randomly assessed in 28 infants with RW while they had a common cold and when asymptomatic. RESULTS: It was found that during colds there was a significant decrease in all forced expiratory parameters and this was much more evident for flows (FEF(50%), FEF(75%) and FEF(25C75%)) which were definitively abnormal (less than ?1.65 z-score) in the majority of infants. There was not association between family asthma, tobacco exposure, and other factors, with the extent of lung function decrease during colds. Tobacco during pregnancy but not a history of family asthma was significantly associated to lower expiratory flows; however, the association was significant only when infants were asymptomatic.

We calculated associations of ADMA and SDMA with mortality and organ failure, and we developed a predictive algorithm based upon these biomarkers to predict mortality risk. Nine patients (29%) experienced in-hospital death. SDMA and ADMA serum concentrations were significantly higher at admission in COVID-19 patients who died than in survivors. Cut-offs of 0.90 mol/L for SDMA (AUC, 0.904, p = 0.0005) and 0.66 mol/L for ADMA (AUC, 0.874, p = 0.0013) were found in ROC analyses to best discriminate both subgroups of patients.

Estimates for specific malformations were imprecise. The pooled RR from the meta-analysis with six prior studies was 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03).

Subsequently, the active components were intersected with the disease targets. Also, interactions among the targets were computed using the STRING database. Biological function and pathway enrichment were analyzed using the Cluster Profiler package in the R software. Protein-protein interaction and component target pathway network were constructed using the Cytoscape software. Ultimately, the key targets and their corresponding components in the network were verified using the AutoDock Vina software. The results showed Salvia miltiorrhiza had 111 targets for acute pancreatitis. The biological process (BP) analysis showed that the active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza induced a drug response, positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II promoter, signal transduction, positive regulation of cell proliferation, and negative regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, the KEGG enrichment analysis screened 118 (P < 0.05) signaling pathways, such as the pathways related to cancer, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway, to name a few. Finally, molecular docking showed that the active components of Salvia miltiorrhiza had a good binding affinity with their corresponding target proteins.

IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures.

The other pioneer Chief in Kirinyaga county was Gutu wa Kibetu (1860C1927) who reigned in the Eastern part of Kirinyaga county. Gioko reigned in the western part of Kirinyaga county (Ndia) that extended to some geographical parts of the present-day Nyeri county and the present-day Embu county. Njega also became the first paramount Chief of Embu district, which refers to the present-day Embu and Kirinyaga counties. As colonial hegemony and the protestant missionary enterprises, and its resultant evangelical theology, began to shape up in the present-day Kirinyaga county and the surrounding areas between 1904 and 1906, it found Gioko and Kibetu as the Athamaki (the most revered leaders). The evangelical European missionaries (Church Missionary Society [CMS]) who were comfortable with the colonial expansion, as it provided western governance structures that favoured their enterprises, employed Calvinistic theology in their dealings with the colonial government, and they dealt with the local leaders ( Athamaki ), who were eventually promoted to the post of Chiefs in 1908 by the new rulers. Nevertheless, the missionarys emphasis on unrealised eschatology (future concerns) differed sharply with those of Athamaki who were the custodians of African indigenous religion and its resultant emphasis on realised eschatology (present concerns). As an agent of African religion, how did Gioko relate with the early 20th-century evangelical European missionaries and their Calvinistic tendencies that favoured the ChurchCState relationship as the way of God?

However, the sharing of diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually prohibited due to patients' privacy concerns. This causes the issue of insufficient data sets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that produces an unbiased global model based on the received local model updates trained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. Nevertheless, the default setting of federated learning introduces a huge communication cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when severe data heterogeneity of clients exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this article, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based federated learning systems to analyze medical diagnostic images. Furthermore, we present a dynamic fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients according to their local model performance and schedule the model fusion based on participating clients' training time. In addition, we summarize a category of medical diagnostic image data sets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication efficiency, and fault tolerance.","output":"Dynamic-Fusion-Based Federated Learning for COVID-19 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to compare the dynamic differences of immunological parameters between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: The cytokine profiles and lymphocyte subsets of 664 patients with COVID-19 (31 severe cases and 633 non-severe cases) were longitudinally analyzed. Results: Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases had higher age (64 vs 40 years, p < 0.001), more common comorbidities (74.2% vs 20.5%, p < 0.001) and lymphopenia (0.7 vs 1.4109 /L, p < 0.001). Severe cases had markedly higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 than non-severe cases from baseline to 35 days after admission (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the dynamic levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-, IFN-, and IFN- between the two groups (p > 0.05). The absolute counts of lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD45+ T cells were markedly lower in severe COVID-19 patients compared with that in non-severe cases from baseline to 35 days after admission (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the dynamic levels of white cells count, CD19+ B cells count, and NK cells count between the two groups (p > 0.05). The decrease of T lymphocyte subsets reached its peak at day 1 to 3 after admission, and gradually increased during the follow-up period in the non-severe group;however, always sustained at low levels in the severe group. Conclusion: The dynamic changes of cytokine profiles and T lymphocyte subsets are related with COVID-19 progression.Funding Statement: This study was supported by grant NO.17411969700 from Shanghai Association for Science and Technology and grant NO.19YF1441200 from Shanghai Sailing Plan Program.Declaration of Interests: None.Ethics Approval Statement: The verbal informed consents were obtained from all participants.

This occurs due to, and further enhances, viral immune evasion and survival. Since the discovery of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which manifests in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a great number of studies have described the association between this virus and pathologically increased or decreased immune cell counts. In this review, we consider the absolute and relative changes to innate and adaptive immune cell numbers, in COVID-19. In severe disease particularly, neutrophils are increased, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Dysregulation of other granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils represent an unusual COVID-19 phenomenon. Contrastingly, the impact on the different types of monocytes leans more strongly to an altered phenotype, e.g. HLA-DR expression, rather than numerical changes. However, it is the adaptive immune response which bears the most profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell lymphopenia correlates with increased risk of ICU admission and death; therefore, this parameter is particularly important for clinical decision making. Mild and severe disease differ in the rate of immune cell counts returning to normal levels post disease. Tracking the recovery trajectories of various immune cell counts may also have implications for long-term COVID-19 monitoring. This review represents a snapshot of our current knowledge, showing that much has been achieved in a short period of time. Alterations in counts of distinct immune cells represent an accessible metric to inform patient care decision or predict disease outcomes.","output":"Neutrophilia, lymphopenia and myeloid dysfunction: A living review of the quantitative changes to innate and adaptive immune cells which define COVID-19 pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Giving a healthy birth plays a vital role in a persons personality development, but giving unhealthy birth and abortion can increase the risk of a range of mental disorders and psychological harms including reduced well-being and quality of life. Psychological interventions can reduce the problems of individuals, so the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of counseling with hope therapy on psychological well-being (primary outcome) and quality of life (secondary outcome) of women with an experience of abortion. METHOD: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Alzahra and Taleghani educational and medical centers in Tabriz, Iran, on 52 women aged 16 years and above whose pregnancies led to abortion in 2020C21. Participants were assigned to intervention and control groups using random blocking method. The intervention group received counseling with hope therapy approach in 8 sessions of 45 min twice a week. The psychological well-being and WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaires were completed before the intervention and immediately and 4 weeks after the intervention. Independent t-test and repeated measures ANOVA were used to compare the outcomes in two groups. RESULTS: After the intervention based on the repeated measures ANOVA test and by adjusting the baseline score, the mean total score of psychological well-being in the counseling group was significantly higher than that in the control group (adjusted mean difference (AMD): 76.76; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 63.81 to 89.70; P < 0.001). Also, the mean total score of quality of life in the counseling group was significantly higher than in the control group (AMD: 7.93; 95% CI: 6.38 to 9.46; P < 0.001). The mean score of all sub-domains of psychological well-being and quality of life in the counseling group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Using hope therapy can improve the psychological well-being and quality of life of women after abortion.

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene expression enrichment analysis was performed via gene set enrichment analysis. Lasso regression was utilized to construct prognostic model. Differences in the tumor microenvironment and the immune correlation were analyzed to clarify immune cell infiltration in different clusters and their correlation with the clinical prognosis. Co-expression analysis showed that lncRNA expression was associated closely with m6A. Many lncRNAs were predictive risk factors of prognosis in HCC. m6A-lncRNAs were partially highly expressed in tumor tissue and could be used in a prognostic model to predict HCC prognosis, independent of other clinical characteristics.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the presentation, manifestations and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. RESULTS: We gathered information on 94 IEI patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median age was 25-34 years. 53 patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) auto-inflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure.

Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such \`fear speech' messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new avenues for infectious disease research.

Author summary During the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract information about hostCpathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological knowledge as a potential tool to support investigations during an emergency. This tool is contrasted with conventional approaches that would take months to comb through the massive amount of existing literature. In addition to providing background information for research, scientific publications can be processed to transform textual information into complex networks, which can be integrated with existing knowledge resources to suggest novel hypotheses that potentially contribute to innovative infectious disease research approaches. This study shows that the knowledge extraction and mapping process required to inform clinical and research responses to an emerging epidemic can be efficiently and effectively executed with a dedicated and trained group of experts, a validated process and the necessary tools. Our results further provide an overview of ZIKV biology, allow prediction of drug efficacy and indentify specific host factors and signalling pathways affected by ZIKV.","output":"Informing epidemic (research) responses in a timely fashion by knowledge management - a Zika virus use case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) of porcine, causes lethal watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in piglets and leads to severe economic losses in the swine industry.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TGEV infection significantly facilitated IFN- production as well as activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Screening of TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) was the most potent IFN- inducer and induced IFN- production mainly by activating NF-B but not IRF3. Further analysis showed that nsp14 interacted with DDX1, a member of the DExD/H helicase family. Knockdown of DDX1 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased nsp14-induced IFN- production and NF-B activation. Furthermore, TGEV-induced IFN- production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were decreased in cells transfected with DDX1-specific siRNA, indicating the vital role of DDX1 to TGEV-induced IFN- responses.

However, heterogeneities in image characteristics due to variations in imaging systems and protocols hamper the advancement of reproducible feature extraction pipelines. There is a growing need for realistic patient-based phantoms that accurately mimic human anatomy and disease manifestations to provide consistent ground-truth targets when comparing different feature extraction or image cohort normalization techniques. Materials and MethodsPixelPrint was developed for 3D-printing lifelike lung phantoms for computed tomography (CT) by directly translating clinical images into printer instructions that control the density on a voxel-by-voxel basis. CT datasets of three COVID-19 pneumonia patients served as input for 3D-printing lung phantoms. Five radiologists rated patient and phantom images for imaging characteristics and diagnostic confidence in a blinded reader study. Linear mixed models were utilized to evaluate effect sizes of evaluating phantom as opposed to patient images. Finally, PixelPrints reproducibility was evaluated by producing four phantoms from the same clinical images. ResultsEstimated mean differences between patient and phantom images were small (0.03-0.29, using a 1-5 scale). Effect size assessment with respect to rating variabilities revealed that the effect of having a phantom in the image is within one-third of the inter- and intra-reader variabilities. PixelPrints production reproducibility tests showed high correspondence among four phantoms produced using the same patient images, with higher similarity scores between high-dose scans of the different phantoms than those measured between clinical-dose scans of a single phantom.

Squawks are short inspiratory adventitious sounds that may occur in patients with pneumonia, such as COVID-19 patients. In this work we devised a method for squawk detection in mechanically ventilated patients by developing algorithms for respiratory cycle estimation, squawk candidate identification, feature extraction, and clustering. The best classifier reached an F1 of 0.48 at the sound file level and an F1 of 0.66 at the recording session level. These preliminary results are promising, as they were obtained in noisy environments. This method will give health professionals a new feature to assess the potential deterioration of critically ill patients.","output":"Detection of squawks in respiratory sounds of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning has gained immense attention from researchers in medicine, especially in medical imaging. The main bottleneck is the unavailability of sufficiently large medical datasets required for the good performance of deep learning models. This paper proposes a new framework consisting of one variational autoencoder (VAE), two generative adversarial networks, and one auxiliary classifier to artificially generate realistic-looking skin lesion images and improve classification performance. We first train the encoder-decoder network to obtain the latent noise vector with the image manifolds information and let the generative adversarial network sample the input from this informative noise vector in order to generate the skin lesion images. The use of informative noise allows the GAN to avoid mode collapse and creates faster convergence. To improve the diversity in the generated images, we use another GAN with an auxiliary classifier, which samples the noise vector from a heavy-tailed student t-distribution instead of a random noise Gaussian distribution. The proposed framework was named TED-GAN, with T from the t-distribution and ED from the encoder-decoder network which is part of the solution. The proposed framework could be used in a broad range of areas in medical imaging. We used it here to generate skin lesion images and have obtained an improved classification performance on the skin lesion classification task, rising from 66% average accuracy to 92.5%. The results show that TED-GAN has a better impact on the classification task because of its diverse range of generated images due to the use of a heavy-tailed t-distribution.","output":"Improving Skin Cancer Classification Using Heavy-Tailed Student T-Distribution in Generative Adversarial Networks (TED-GAN)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exploiting the SIQR model for COVID-19, I show that the wavy infection curve in Japan is the result of fluctuation of policy on isolation measure imposed by the government and obeyed by citizens. Assuming the infection coefficient be a two-valued function of the number of daily confirmed new cases, I show that when the removal rate of infected individuals is between these two values, the wavy infection curve is self-organized. On the basis of the infection curve, I classify the outbreak of COVID-19 into five types and show that these differences can be related to the relative magnitude of the transmission coefficient and the quarantine rate of infected individuals.","output":"Self-organized wavy infection curve of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bone fracture healing is a time-consuming and high-priority orthopedic problem worldwide. OBJECTIVES: Discovering the potential mechanism of bone healing at a time course and transcriptional level may better help manage bone fracture. METHODS: In this study, we analyze a time-course bone fracture-healing transcriptional data set in a rat model (GSE592, GSE594, and GSE1371) of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). RNA was obtained from female Sprague-Dawley rats with femoral fracture at the initial time (day 3) as well as early (week 1), middle (week 2), and late (week 4) time periods, with nonfracture rats used as control. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and pathway examinations were performed for further measurements of GSEA and hub genes. RESULTS: Results indicated that the four stages of bone fracture healing at the initial, early, middle, and late time periods represent the phases of hematoma formation, callus formation, callus molding, and mature lamellar bone formation, respectively. Extracellular organization was positively employed throughout the four stages. At the hematoma formation phase, the muscle contraction process was downregulated. Antibacterial peptide pathway was downregulated at all phases. The upregulation of Fn1 (initial, early, middle, and late time periods), Col3a1 (initial, early, and middle time periods), Col11a1 (initial and early time periods), Mmp9 (middle and late time periods), Mmp13 (early, middle, and late time periods) and the downregulation of RatNP-3b (initial, early, middle, and late time periods) were possible symbols for bone fracture healing and may use as therapeutic targets. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest some new potential pathways and genes in the process of bone fracture healing and further provide insights that can be used in targeted molecular therapy for bone fracture healing.","output":"Unveiling the time course mechanism of bone fracture healing by transcriptional profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the Canadian Labour Force Survey, we document the short-term impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on self-employed individuals in Canada, whom we interpret as small business owners We document an important decrease in business ownership between February 2020 and May 2020 (?14 8 percent for incorporated and ?10 1 percent for unincorporated entities) We find a substantial decrease in ownership and aggregate hours for women, immigrants, and less educated people over the same period The occupational categories with the largest decrease are in art, culture, and recreation (?14 8 percent);in education, law, and social, community, and government services (?13 6 percent);and in sales and service occupations (?12 8 percent) Alternate abstract: laide de lEnqute sur la population active au Canada, les auteurs documentent les rpercussions  court terme de la maladie provoque par le coronavirus 2019 (COVID 19) sur les travailleurs indpendants au Canada qui, interprtent-ils, regroupent les propritaires de petites entreprises Ils relvent une importante diminution du nombre de propritaires dentreprises entre fvrier 2020 et mai 2020 (?14,8 pour cent dans le cas des entits constitues en socits et 10,1 pour cent dans celui des entits non constitues en socits) Ils observent un flchissement marqu dans la proprit et le total des heures travailles chez les femmes, les immigrants et les personnes moins scolarises au cours de la mme priode Les secteurs dactivit prsentant la diminution la plus importante sont ceux des arts, de la culture et des loisirs (?14,8 pour cent) ;de lducation, du droit et des services sociaux, communautaires et gouvernementaux (?13,6 pour cent) ;et des fonctions de vente et de services (?12,8 pour cent)","output":"Short-Term Effect of COVID-19 on Self-Employed Workers in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil pollution is a serious international concern due to its harmful effect on human health and the environment. This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil by Bacillus licheniformis. For this purpose, oil removal from the artificial seawater was studied by response surface methodology (RSM). After the screening experiments, pH (4-10), NaCl concentration (0-10 g/L), and oil concentration (500-4500 ppm) were selected as influential factors. Moreover, to evaluate the bacterial capability in bioremediation of an actual polluted site, crude oil spill with a salinity of 35 g/L was experimentally simulated. The proposed model in this study clearly shows that both selected individual factors and their interactions are significantly effective on the crude oil biodegradation capacity. The results showed that Bacillus licheniformis was able to degrade crude oil at different concentrations of oil, especially at low concentrations, which are challenging in actual polluted sites. 15%-66% removal was achieved for 500-4500 ppm of crude oil after 14 days. Furthermore, according to the obtained results, this bacterium can tolerate the salinity up to 3.5%. At this salinity level, crude oil removal was 23.43 and 25.64% in neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. Process factors were optimized, and 54.8% of crude oil was removed at optimum conditions i.e., 3500 ppm crude oil concentration, 2.5 g/L of NaCl and pH equal to 8.5. Finally, it can be concluded that the selected bacterium of this study can be more effective in harsh environments such as hypersaline and alkaline conditions.","output":"Investigation of Bacillus licheniformis in the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil: A two-stage sequential approach containing factor-screening and optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>Selfie tourism is a fast-growing phenomenon.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF and its short-term mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on pre-existing AF among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Twelve studies, enrolling 15.562 COVID-19 patients (mean age 71.6 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was 11.0% of cases (95% CI: 7.8C15.2%, p < 0.0001) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 95.2%). Pre-existing AF was associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.47C3.36, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 79.1%).

The structure of membranes was varied by using different polymer concentrations in N,N-dimethylacetamide, electric field strength, and concentration of AgNO3 and ZnCl2 in an electrospinning solution. Materials synthesised were analysed by nitrogen sorption and mercury intrusion porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, particle filtration efficiency, and pressure drop methods. The concentration of Ag and Zn nanoclusters in PVDF membranes was established and the influence on nanofibers activity has been discussed. The hydrophobicity of membranes was tested using the wetting (contact) angle measurement method. The human influenza A virus (IAV) A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) strain was used to evaluate the virucidal activity of filtration materials. The virucidal activity increased with Ag nanoclusters concentration in fibres.

The current research aimed to explore whether the search-engine query patterns could serve as a potential tool for monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases between January 11, 2020, and April 22, 2020, from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The search index values of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, fatigue) were retrieved from the Baidu Index. Spearmans correlation analysis was used to analyze the association between the Baidu index values for each COVID-19-related symptom and the number of confirmed cases. Regional distributions among 34 provinces/ regions in China were also analyzed. RESULTS: Daily growth of confirmed cases and Baidu index values for each COVID-19-related symptom presented robust positive correlations during the outbreak (fever: r(s)=0.705, p=9.623 10(? 6); cough: r(s)=0.592, p=4.485 10(? 4); fatigue: r(s)=0.629, p=1.494 10(? 4); sputum production: r(s)=0.648, p=8.206 10(? 5); shortness of breath: r(s)=0.656, p=6.182 10(C5)). The average search-to-confirmed interval (STCI) was 19.8 days in China. The daily Baidu Index values optimal time lags were the 4 days for cough, 2 days for fatigue, 3 days for sputum production, 1 day for shortness of breath, and 0 days for fever. CONCLUSION: The searches of COVID-19-related symptoms on the Baidu search engine were significantly correlated to the number of confirmed cases. Since the Baidu search engine could reflect the publics attention to the pandemic and the regional epidemics of viruses, relevant departments need to pay more attention to areas with high searches of COVID-19-related symptoms and take precautionary measures to prevent these potentially infected persons from further spreading.
