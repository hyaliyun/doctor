Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be in an actively dividing state or in a quiescent state. The balance between stem cell quiescence and cycling activity determines the rate of neurogenesis. With age, more NSCs enter the quiescent state, while the total number of NSCs decreases. Here we reconsider an existing mathematical model of how neural stem cells switch between active and quiescent states from the point of view of control theory by considering the activation rate, self-renewal probability, and division rate as control parameters rather than as pre-defined functions. Our goal is to test whether those modifications to the basic model could explain the observed decline of neural stem cells with age better than Gomerzian time-dependent parameters, and compare the output from different model variants to experimental data from mice using AIC. We find that time-dependent activation rate provides the best fit to the activated cell fraction (ACF) of NSCs over time, but that other model variants with constant parameter values can better fit the total number of NSCs over time. We also consider an alternate model for NSCs with nonlinear feedback from progenitor cells that affect NSC parameters, and compare all models to experimental stem cell and progenitor data. However, all of the feedback models considered provide a worse fit to the experimental data. This suggests that when switching between active and quiescent stem cells is considered, a time-dependent linear model outperforms the integral feedback mechanism considered by other models of stem cell lineages. Fitting progenitor data for both the time varying models and feedback models indicates that four or five intermediate transit amplifying progenitor states are necessary. Our modeling suggests that in order to determine whether an increase in age-related neural stem cell quiescence is determined by by a decreasing stem cell activation rate or an increased stem cell depletion rate, additional experiments should be designed to explore whether or not depletion of the stem cell pool is occurring, and that a higher resolution time series for activated cell fraction (ACF) would be best to resolve this issue.","output":"Distinguishing between multiple mathematical models of neural stem cell quiescence and activation during age-related neural stem cell decline in neurogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Serological tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are becoming of great interest to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, a fully automated indirect immunoassay that detects antibodies directed to a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid antigen. STUDY DESIGN: Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay was compared to an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on sera from patients with COVID-19 collected at different days after symptoms onset or infected by other human coronaviruses. Comparison with neutralization test was also performed. RESULTS: After 7, 14 and >14 days after onset ARCHITECT was positive on 8.3 %; 61.9 % and 100 % of the tested samples compared to 58.3 %; 85.7 % and 100 % by IFA. The sensitivity was 72 % vs. IFA and 66.7 % vs. a real-time PCR, the specificity was 100 %. On 18 samples with neutralizing activity, 17 were positive by Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay showed a satisfactory performance, with a very high specificity. IgG reactivity against SARSCoV-2 N antigen was detectable in all patients by two weeks after symptoms onset. In addition, concordance between this serological response and viral neutralization suggests that a strong humoral response may be predictive of a neutralization activity, regardless of the target antigens. This finding supports the use of this automated serological assay in diagnostic algorithm and public health intervention, especially for high loads of testing.","output":"Performance evaluation of Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay in comparison with indirect immunofluorescence and virus microneutralization test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Community-acquired bacterial meningitis is a continually changing disease. This review summarises both dynamic epidemiology and emerging data on pathogenesis. Updated clinical guidelines are discussed, new agents undergoing clinical trials intended to reduce secondary brain damage are presented. RECENT FINDINGS: Conjugate vaccines are effective against serotype/serogroup-specific meningitis but vaccine escape variants are rising in prevalence. Meningitis occurs when bacteria evade mucosal and circulating immune responses and invade the brain: directly, or across the bloodCbrain barrier. Tissue damage is caused when host genetic susceptibility is exploited by bacterial virulence. The classical clinical triad of fever, neck stiffness and headache has poor diagnostic sensitivity, all guidelines reflect the necessity for a low index of suspicion and early Lumbar puncture. Unnecessary cranial imaging causes diagnostic delays. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and PCR are diagnostic, direct next-generation sequencing of CSF may revolutionise diagnostics. Administration of early antibiotics is essential to improve survival. Dexamethasone partially mitigates central nervous system inflammation in high-income settings. New agents in clinical trials include C5 inhibitors and daptomycin, data are expected in 2025. SUMMARY: Clinicians must remain vigilant for bacterial meningitis. Constantly changing epidemiology and emerging pathogenesis data are increasing the understanding of meningitis.

The aim of this study was to observe clinical characteristics and explore risk factors in COVID-19 patients with liver injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal alanine transaminase (ALT) on admission were divided into a group of normal ALT patients whose ALT was always less than 40 U/l during hospitalization and a group of elevated ALT patients whose ALT was at least once more than 40 U/l after admission. Clinical data, especially virus-induced inflammatory parameters, were analyzed for risk factors and predictive value. The Mann-Whitney U test and t test for comparing means and logistic regression were performed for analysis of risk factors. Area under the ROC curve was used for predictive values. RESULTS Sixteen of 40 (40.0%) patients developed elevated ALT, many of them with more severe COVID-19. The highest ALT level was 101 U/l. The risk factors for liver injury were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CD8+T cell count, and severity of disease, and CRP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.045-1.222, p=0.002) was the independent risk factor.

However, epidemiologically these outbreaks are not well defined. We aimed to define such outbreaks in ACFs by systematically reviewing literature published during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched 11 bibliographic databases for literature published on COVID-19 in ACFs between December 2019 and September 2020. Original studies reporting extractable epidemiological data as part of outbreak investigations or non-outbreak surveillance of ACFs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020211424. Findings: We identified 5,148 publications and selected 49 studies from four continents reporting data on 214,380 residents in 8,502 ACFs with 25,567 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Aged care residents form a distinct vulnerable population with single-facility attack rates of 45% [95% CI 32-58%] and case fatality rates of 23% [95% CI 18-28%]. Of the cases, 31% [95% CI 28-34%] were asymptomatic. The rate of hospitalization amongst residents was 37% [95% CI 35-39%]. Data from 21 outbreaks identified a resident as the index case in 58% of outbreaks and a staff member in 42%. Findings from the included studies were heterogeneous and of low to moderate quality in risk of bias assessment. Interpretation: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases. Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into ACFs is key, and both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of paramount importance.

In particular, the early death cases occurred primarily in older people with a frailty status, possibly due to a weaker immune system fostering faster progression of the viral infection. Frailty is an age-related multidimensional clinical condition defined as a non-specific state of vulnerability, identifying older people at increased risk of falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, disability, dementia, and death. Among frailty phenotypes, social frailty has been least studied. It considers the role of socioeconomic context as a vulnerability status later in life. COVID-19 does not affect all populations equally, and social inequalities contribute to drive the spread of infections. It was known that the perception of social isolation, e.g., loneliness, affects mental and physical health, but the implicated molecular mechanisms, also related to the immune system, and its associated cognitive and health-related sequelae, are poorly understood. The increasing psychological distress derived by prolonged exposure to stress due to the lockdown scenario, and the reduced sources of support, contributed to making heavy demands on personal resources, i.e., self-efficacy and interpersonal variables. So, perceived loneliness may be a factor associated with psychological distress and an outcome in itself.

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic there was a closure of Pennsylvania (PA) liquor stores on March 17, 2020. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study of AWS patients presenting to a tertiary care hospital. We used descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical variables and compared AWS consults placed to the medical toxicology service for six months preceding liquor store closure to those placed between March 17, 2020 and August 31, 2020. We compared this to consults placed to the medical toxicology service placed from October 1, 2019 through March 16, 2020. Charts were identified based on consults placed to the medical toxicology service, and alcohol withdrawal was determined via chart review by a medical toxicologist. This study did not require IRB approval. We evaluated Emergency Department (ED) length of stay (LOS), weekly and monthly consultation rate, rate of admission and ED recidivism, both pre- and post-liquor store closure. RESULTS: A total of 324 AWS consults were placed during the ten month period. 142 (43.8%) and 182 (56.2%) consults were pre- and post-liquor store closure. The number of consults was not statistically significant comparing these two time frames. There was no significant difference by patient age, gender, or race or by weekly or monthly consultation rate when comparing pre- and post-liquor store periods. The median ED LOS was 7 h (95% Confidence Interval (CI) Larson et al. (2012), Pollard et al. (2020) [5, 11]) and did not significantly differ between pre- and post-liquor store periods (p = 0.78). 92.9% of AWS patients required admission without significant difference between the pre- and post-liquor store closure periods (94.4% vs. 91.8%, p = 0.36). There was a significant increase in the number of AWS patients requiring a return ED visit (Odds Ratio 2.49; 95% CI [1.38, 4.49]) post closure.

This study aims to identify the viral etiologies of ALRI in hospitalized children in Jordan University Hospital and compare the clinical characteristics of influenza virus infection with other respiratory viruses. METHODS: A retrospective viral surveillance study that included 152 children below 15 years of age admitted with ALRI from December 2018 through April 2019 was conducted. We recorded results of real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for common respiratory viruses. Clinical and demographic information of the study population was collected from patients' electronic medical records. RESULTS: 152 patients were identified with a median age of 1 year (mean was 2.1 years). Ninety-five patients (62.5%) were males. One or more viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 145 (95.3%) children. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most detected virus in 68 patients (44.8%). Influenza virus was detected in 25 patients (16.4%). Children with influenza infection had more fever and lower leukocyte count compared to children infected with other viruses. The severity of the ALRI correlated significantly with several factors, including age less than six months and the presence of neuromuscular disease (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Viral detection was common among children admitted with ALRI. Viruses, including influenza, are recognized as significant contributors to the morbidity associated with ALRI.

Previous studies have shown the image-derived metric of ventilation defect per cent (VDP) to correlate with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV(1) in asthma. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the utility of hyperpolarised xenon-129 ((129)Xe) ventilation MRI in clinical care and examine its relationship with spirometry and other clinical metrics in people seen in a severe asthma service. METHODS: 26 people referred from a severe asthma clinic for MRI scanning were assessed by contemporaneous (129)Xe MRI and spirometry. A subgroup of 18 patients also underwent reversibility testing with spirometry and MRI. Quantitative MRI measures of ventilation were calculated, VDP and the ventilation heterogeneity index (VH(I)), and compared to spirometry, Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ7) and blood eosinophil count. Images were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: VDP and VH(I) correlated with FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC but not with ACQ7 or blood eosinophil count. Discordance of MRI imaging and symptoms and/or pulmonary function tests also occurred, prompting diagnostic re-evaluation in some cases. CONCLUSION: Hyperpolarised gas MRI provides a complementary method of assessment in people with difficult to manage asthma in a clinical setting. When used as a tool supporting clinical care in a severe asthma service, occurrences of discordance between symptoms, spirometry and MRI scanning indicate how MRI scanning may add to a management pathway.","output":"Xenon ventilation MRI in difficult asthma: initial experience in a clinical setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This article examines the preliminary impact of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic on India's economic and budgetary landscape C the most affected developing country from the first wave of the pandemic It also includes a discussion of the monetary and fiscal responses adopted and the challenges faced in formulating the response to the pandemic Design/methodology/approach: Using high-frequency economic and fiscal indicators, this article evaluates the economic impact of the pandemic on the Indian economy Further, it uses data from government sources and news to highlight the measures adopted at the national and subnational level in response to the pandemic Findings: The difficult economic conditions prior to the pandemic limited the fiscal space available to the government As a result, the national and subnational governments have been cautious of accumulating excessive debt and have primarily responded with liquidity-enhancing measures, in addition to some fiscal measures for the most vulnerable Overdependence on consumption taxes has led to unprecedented revenue shortfalls prompting the exploration of new avenues for revenue generation and implementation of austerity measures C some of which may be counterproductive in the long run Originality/value: The paper highlights the policy response of the largest democracy that has been hit hard by the pandemic It also highlights various institutional and resource constraints that influenced the policies adopted India's experience in responding to the virus could provide lessons for other developing countries ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Fiscal and monetary response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) are at high risk of infection with SARS-Cov-2 and death due to COVID-19.

Design: Prospective observational. Setting, Patients, intervention and measurements: REIN national registry was used to compare the severity of 1474 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in MHD patients after 0, 1 or 2 doses of mRNA vaccine. Anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ specific-T cells were measured after 2D and 3D of BNT162b2 in a monocentric cohort of 75 MHD patients. Results: Vaccination reduced disease severity but 11% of MHD patients infected after 2D still died. Tolerance to 3D of BNT162b2 was excellent. MHD patients with humoral response similar to healthy volunteers after 2D did not generate more immune effectors after 3D and had more side effects. In contrast, 2/3 of MHD patients with suboptimal response after 2D reached optimal titer of anti-RBD IgG and/or developed spike-specific CD8+ T cells after 3D.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective cohort study of 1 926 526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort included 174 568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1 133 848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174 568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32 472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.","output":"Clinical Characterization and Prediction of Clinical Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among US Adults Using Data From the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: [1] FEMA, HHS [United States Department of Health and Human Services], and our federal partners work with state, local, tribal and territorial governments to execute a whole-of-America response to COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic and protect the health and safety of the American people [2] FEMA continues to expedite movement of commercially pre-sourced and commercially procured critical supplies from the global market to medical distributors in various locations across the U S through Project Airbridge [3] Last night, FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor issued a letter to the nation's emergency managers outlining lessons learned from the first 30 days of FEMA leading the 'Whole-of-America' response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Coronaviruses;Emerging infectious diseases;Infectious disease;Communicable diseases","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Whole-Of-America Response (April 16, 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increased risk of harm from COVID-19 infection in pregnancy highlights the importance of including pregnant people in COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment.

Significant penetration of counter ions into the molecule was confirmed. The electric potential distribution within and outside the molecule was quantitatively described using the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) approach. Using this model, calculations were performed, yielding the surface and zeta potential for various physicochemical parameters, comprising pH, the electric permittivity, the ion penetration depth and the protein volume fraction (crowding effect). The theoretical results were used for the interpretation of experimental data acquired under different ionic strengths and temperatures by electrophoretic mobility measurements. It is confirmed that the experimental data are adequately reflected for acidic pH values by the non-linear PB model where the nominal molecule charge was calculated from the H++ model. The deviations occurring for larger pH values were accounted for by considering additional non-electrostatic interactions stemming from the van der Waals and ion-induced dipole forces. In this way, it is both experimentally and theoretically confirmed that the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule in electrolyte solutions is considerably smaller than the nominal, structure-based, predicted charge. As a result, under physiological conditions prevailing, e.g. in skeletal muscles, the effective charge of the myoglobin molecule should practically vanish. One can expect that the approach developed in this work can be applied for predicting charging mechanisms of other protein molecules characterized by an analogous charge vs. pH characteristic, e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike proteins, and for soft particles with pH responsive characteristics.","output":"Myoglobin molecule charging in electrolyte solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This article analyzes the changes in downloads and activity of users of select popular mental health mobile applications (mHealth apps) during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD: Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS: Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. APPLICATION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","output":"Investigating Popular Mental Health Mobile Application Downloads and Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been problematic worldwide. A new SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (LUMIPULSEa??) was licensed and widely used in Japan since May 2020. We conducted this study intending to whether the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test using a saliva sample is effective and valid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of both the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a saliva sample from individuals suspected as having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 305 samples were collected and tested in Aichi Medical University Hospital and affiliated facilities from December 2020 until January 2021 at our institute. Using reverse-transcription PCR as a reference, the AUROC of the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test was 0.903 (95% confidential interval 0.845-0.962, p < 0.001). The appropriate cut-off antigen level was 4.0 pg/mL and had a sensitivity of 77.8%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 98%, and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of the antigen test decreased among patients among patients with COVID-19 with threshold cycle (Ct-value)&#8805;27, which shows the AUROC was 0.795 (95%CI 0.687-0.907, p < 0.001).

FoF can lead to self-imposed restriction of activities and then further decline in physical capacities that predispose older adults to frailty. Evaluating the association of these two geriatric syndromes may be the first step for understanding their complex relationship and might ultimately lead to establishing therapeutic goals and guiding treatments for older adults with frailty. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence regarding the association between FoF and frailty. Methods: All the articles that provided information on the association between FoF and frailty were selected from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and EMBASE in search of relevant papers. Articles reporting information on the association between FoF (exposure) and frailty (outcome), with older adults (age 60 years) living in the community (ie, living either at home or in places of residence that do not provide nursing care or rehabilitation) were included. Only original articles with observational design (cross-sectional or longitudinal/cohort) were included. The methodological quality of included articles was evaluated independently by the two assessors through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Results: The initial searches found 4,342 articles, of which 10 articles were included in this review: 7 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies, and 1 study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The total sample was composed of 6,294 community-dwelling older adults (61.8% women). Among the longitudinal studies, adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.18 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.36) to 9.87 (95% CI = 5.22; 18.68), while the adjusted odds ratios of the cross-sectional studies ranged from 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02; 1.07) to 7.16 (95% CI = 2.34; 21.89). Conclusion: FoF increases the risk of frailty in community-dwelling older adults. The knowledge of this association is of utmost importance in clinical practice, since it can help health professionals in the development of rehabilitation, prevention, and health promotion protocols. In addition, these findings can contribute to the development of public health policies and actions aimed at reducing the FoF and consequently the frailty.

However, the Bitcoin return does not have both of these characteristics. Due to this, I developed a Markov regime switching approach to analyze the effect of Bitcoin on an international portfolio performance.

A cross-sectional qualitative study targeting laboratory personals and suppliers in Saudi Arabia is conducted to evaluate laboratory material inventory management. Our sample includes twelve hospitals and ten suppliers. The study revealed that the supply chain functions resilience was moderate to mildly affected during the pandemic. The higher effect in the supply chain functions was in the lead time (58%), followed by purchasing (33%), then the inventory (25 %). The actual lab supply was significantly affected in 2 hospitals only, moderately affected in 7 hospitals (58%), and mildly affected in 2 hospitals. The unavailability of reagents was the highest result of the disruption (50%) besides the price change and lack of alternatives. Almost (86 %) of suppliers reported that their service was partially affected in most supply chain functions although they claimed having reasonable resilience measures/processes to sustain their operations. The highest risk mitigation process were the backup supply, recovery plan, and emergency/disaster agreements coverage. Most than half of the organizations reported that they have mature resilience measures. This leads us to conclude that both laboratory and supplier inventory and supply chain management had reasonable resilience processes in Saudi Arabia.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals who may benefit from mental health resources. METHODS: Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. RESULTS: Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (n=325,691, 70.4%), and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (n=28,009, 58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for 3 days by 80.9% (n=34,611) of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% (n=11,444) returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% (n=10,546) of those who did not try a tool returned (P<.001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users who completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n=4870, 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n=2680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n=1455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (mean 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (mean 3.08 days; t(1)=3.01, P=.003). Individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (mean 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (mean 3.13 days; t(1)=2.29, P=.02).

The per-patient mean number of the fear element was 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.3), which differed significantly for males and females (1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.6 and 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, respectively, p=0.03). The most frequent fear was that of addiction and the bad effects of anti-seizure medications (both 45.0%). Upon bootstrap regression after constraining gender, the fear elements were associated with illiteracy, difficulty in understanding epilepsy and sleeping in a prone position. The sample power was 99.0%. Conclusion: There was a significant representation of fear among those with idiopathic epilepsy, especially among the females, particularly the fear of brain tumour, premature death and more frequent/severe seizures over time. At least 65.0% of idiopathic subjects are likely to be affected by at least one fear. The essential mitigating approach should be the education of practitioners towards better identification and therapeutic handling of comorbid constructs, and also for the education of patients and their caregivers towards better awareness and prevention. There is also a need for formal Epilepsy Educators towards better awareness, therapeutic support and prevention of epilepsy.","output":"Evaluation of Fear in Idiopathic Epilepsy Using Population-Based Survey and Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in Epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keywords: Digital, PROMs, Transformation Purpose: Data-driven care, supported by digital technology, is endorsed by the NHS Long Term Plan (2019). Data collection and analysis being vital for evaluation of clinical services, quality improvement and optimal patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an operational barrier to the collection of paper-based patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust Integrated Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy department (GSTT iMSK). This accelerated the need for automated, digital systems of data collection. Aim: To implement an automated method of electronic PROM (ePROM) data collection, analysis and reporting. Objectives: ? To identify the most suitable condition-specific and/or generic PROMs to employ in GSTT iMSK. ? To understand stakeholder preferences regarding PROMs. ? To identify a vendor to supply an automated solution for ePROM data collection, analysis and reporting. Methods: The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) iterative methodology was used with the following sequential steps undertaken: ? PLAN: A narrative, scoping review was undertaken to identify the most suitable condition specific and/or generic musculoskeletal PROMs. ? DO: Stakeholders (patients, GSTT iMSK and external physiotherapists) were identified and surveyed as to their preferences regarding the use of PROMs. Survey Monkey was used to collect physiotherapist data remotely. Patient data was supplemented with telephone surveys to account for potential selection bias. ? STUDY: The review findings were compared against the stakeholder preferences with an aim to optimise completion rate. ? ACT: Vendors were vetted against a pre-agreed criteria. Results: PROM suitability: The MSK-HQ was identified as the most suitable generic measure for an MSK service due to;ease of use, anatomical and condition generalisability, and simple scoring system. Stakeholder preferences: All stakeholders felt PROMs were important to deliver data-driven, optimized patient care. Clinicians felt time and method of completion were barriers to PROM use. Patients were prepared to spend 20 minutes completing PROMs if applicable to their pain and care and preferred ePROMs to paper forms. Vendor selection: Many vendors offered digital solutions to automate collection, analysis and reporting of PROMs. However, many were costly and outside the governance/procurement frameworks for GSTT. DrDoctor, a Trust partner, offered the best solution economically (the system could be built within a current contract at no additional cost) and met all requirements identified during analysis. Conclusion(s): Stakeholders are more likely to engage in PROMs if provided with a user-friendly platform that offers value to the care they will deliver or receive. The MSK-HQ shows excellent validity when used in isolation compared to pathology-specific PROMs and demonstrates that multiple measures are not necessary. Financial restrictions and a focus on value-based care within the NHS make it important to explore existing contracts for digital solutions at no additional cost. Future PDSA cycles will use this automated system via DrDoctor to evaluate clinical services and optimise completion rate. Impact: GSTT iMSK is able to use automated systems to evaluate service quality at a population level and undertake regular auditing to ensure acceptable standards are being achieved. A culture of ongoing service evaluation can identify areas of future quality improvement and staff development, whilst redirecting saved administrative resource to different areas.

Here, a NAD(H)-dependent (2R,3R)-BDH from Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090 (NgBDH), the causative agent of gonorrhoea, was functionally characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that it belongs to zinc-containing medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The recombinant NgBDH migrated as a single band with a size of around 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE and could be confirmed by Western blotting and mass spectrometry. For the oxidation of either (2R,3R)-2,3-BD or meso-2,3-BD, the enzyme exhibited a broad pH optimum between pH 9.5 to 11.5. For the reduction of (3R/3S)-acetoin, the pH optimum was around 6.5. The enzyme could catalyze the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-BD (Km = 0.16 mM, kcat/Km = 673 s-1  mM-1) and meso-BD (Km = 0.72 mM, kcat/Km = 165 s-1  mM-1). Moreover, it could also reduce (3R/3S)-acetoin with a Km of 0.14 mM and a kcat/Km of 885 s-1  mM-1.

Wiring Affect with ReAttach (W.A.R.A.) is a brief psychological intervention aiming to decrease negative affect, that can be offered online. METHODS: We assessed the effect of remote W.A.R.A. on negative affect in 37 patients. Consequently, we compared the effect of remote W.A.R.A. versus face-to-face W.A.R.A on negative affect in a cross-sectional design. RESULTS: W.A.R.A. remote therapy provoked a significant reduction of negative affect with a large effect size (d = 3.08, p < 0.001). However, the reduction on negative affect was smaller than with W.A.R.A. face-to-face. We found a substantial difference between W.A.R.A. remote therapy and W.A.R.A. face-to-face in decrease of negative affect (d = 1.36, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of the pilot-study is the sample size of 37 patients. Besides, we designed a numeric rating scale for evaluating negative affect. We investigated the impact on negative affect by assessing unpleasant feelings. This conceptualization of negative affect might still be a point of discussion. CONCLUSION: The studys findings indicated that W.A.R.A. remote therapy significantly reduced negative affect, but to a lesser extent than W.A.R.A. face-to-face.

The complex nature of the disease, heterogeneity, highly invasive potential of GBM tumours and until recently, reduced investment in research funding compared with other cancer types, are contributing factors to few advancements in disease management. Survival rates remain low with less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years. Another important contributing factor is the use of preclinical models that fail to fully recapitulate GBM pathophysiology, preventing efficient translation from the lab into successful therapies in the clinic. This review critically evaluates current preclinical GBM models, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of using such models, and outlines several emerging techniques in GBM modelling using animal-free approaches. These novel approaches to a highly complex disease such as GBM show evidence of a more truthful recapitulation of GBM pathobiology with high reproducibility. The resulting advancements in this field will offer new biological insights into GBM and its aetiology with potential to contribute towards the development of much needed improved treatments for GBM in future.","output":"Preclinical models of glioblastoma: limitations of current models and the promise of new developments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease outbreak in Wuhan City in Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, soon spread to over a hundred countries.

Previous studies have found that patients have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death than adults in the community. The aim of this project was to improve the care of patients with COVID-19 in psychiatric inpatient settings. METHOD: A baseline audit was conducted of care COVID-19 patients received in wards that experienced outbreaks in January 2021 in a London Mental Health Trust. Clinical notes were reviewed for management plans, including clear documentation of risk of serious illness, frequency of vitals monitoring, and thresholds for escalation to medical teams. A new protocol was subsequently developed and implemented at one inpatient unit: COVID-19: Early Identification of Risk and Management. This included an adjusted 4C mortality score to determine risk of deterioration, and schedules for observation monitoring based on this outcome. Each schedule specified separate frequencies of monitoring of critical observations (oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and routine observations, thus minimising unnecessary staff exposure. It prompted venous thromboembolism (VTE) assessment and documentation of escalation criteria. RESULT: 44 patients were identified across three working age (WAA, n = 29) and two older age (OA, n = 15) adult wards. 7.5% of WAA and 33.3% of OA patients were hospitalised. 20% of OA patients died following a positive test. 58% of patients had a documented management plan for COVID-19, but only 56% mentioned observation frequency, 19% escalation criteria, and 9% risk of serious disease. No patient received a repeat VTE assessment following diagnosis. The audit identified inconsistent approaches to COVID-19 management between wards, and found no relationship between risk of deterioration and frequency of observation monitoring. Following implementation of this protocol, 100% (n = 4) of patients had a robust plan for COVID-19 management, and 100% received a VTE assessment. CONCLUSION: The audit supported previous findings that psychiatric inpatients are at risk of serious COVID-19 infection. This highlights an urgent clinical and ethical need to optimise COVID-19 care in psychiatric inpatient settings. The results of this audit suggest that risk factors for severe infection and elements of routine care are not widely understood or implemented by clinical staff. Introducing evidence-based protocols to support clinicians in managing the physical healthcare of these patients may be one way of promoting best practice. The improvement in care observed in the pilot study has resulted in this protocol being rolled out across the Trust in an ongoing quality improvement project.","output":"Improving the physical healthcare of COVID-19 patients in inpatient psychiatric settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The metagenome embedded in urban sewage is an attractive new data source to understand urban ecology and assess human health status at scales beyond a single host. Analyzing the viral fraction of wastewater in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown the potential of wastewater as aggregated samples for early detection, prevalence monitoring, and variant identification of human diseases in large populations. However, using census-based population size instead of real-time population estimates can mislead the interpretation of data acquired from sewage, hindering assessment of representativeness, inference of prevalence, or comparisons of taxa across sites. Here, we show that taxon abundance and sub-species diversisty in gut-associated microbiomes are new feature space to utilize for human population estimation. Using a population-scale human gut microbiome sample of over 1,100 people, we found that taxon-abundance distributions of gut-associated multi-person microbiomes exhibited generalizable relationships with respect to human population size. Here and throughout this paper, the human population size is essentially the sample size from the wastewater sample. We present a new algorithm, MicrobiomeCensus, for estimating human population size from sewage samples. MicrobiomeCensus harnesses the inter-individual variability in human gut microbiomes and performs maximum likelihood estimation based on simultaneous deviation of multiple taxas relative abundances from their population means. MicrobiomeCensus outperformed generic algorithms in data-driven simulation benchmarks and detected population size differences in field data. New theorems are provided to justify our approach. This research provides a mathematical framework for inferring population sizes in real time from sewage samples, paving the way for more accurate ecological and public health studies utilizing the sewage metagenome. Author summary Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an emerging field that employs sewage as aggregated samples of human populations. This approach is particularly promising for tracking diseases that can spread asymptomatically in large populations, such as the COVID-19. As a new type of biological data, sewage has its own unique challenges to utilize. While wastewater samples are usually assumed to represent large populations, it is not guaranteed, because of stochasticity in toilet flushes; unlike epidemiological experiments collecting data from individuals, sample size, i.e., the human population size represented by a wastewater sample, is a fundamental yet difficult-to-characterize parameter for sewage samples. Researchers would need to aggregate data from large areas and week-long collection to stabilize data, during which, important spikes in small areas or short time scales may be lost. It also remains challenging to turn viral titers into case prevalences, evaluating representativeness, or comparing measurements across sites/studies. This study provides a framework to estimate human population size from sewage utilizing human gut-associated microorganisms. Through analysis, we demonstrate that variance of taxon abundances and single-nucleotide polymorphism as two variables that change with population size. We provide a new tool MicrobiomeCensus that performs population size estimation from microbial taxon abundances. MicrobiomeCensus outperforms generic algorithms in terms of computational efficiency while at comparable or better accuracy. Using MicrobiomeCensus, we detected population size differences in sewage samples taken in Cambridge, MA, under two sampling approaches, i.e., grab or composite sampling. This study provides a framework to utilize individual-level microbiomes to learn from sewage, paving the way to prevalence estimation and improved spatio-temporal resolutions in WBE..","output":"Microbial Species Abundance Distributions Guide Human Population Size Estimation from Sewage Microbiomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral metagenomic libraries are a promising but previously untapped source of new reagent enzymes.

But easing the measures too early carries a high risk of transmission re-escalations. To assess if physical distancing can be relaxed, a number of epidemic indicators are used, most notably the reproduction number R . Many developing countries, however, have limited capacities to estimate R accurately. This study aims to demonstrate how health production function can be used to assess the state of COVID-19 transmission and to determine a risk-based physical distancing relaxation policy. Methods: The author establishes a short-run health production function, representing the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, from the standard SIR model. Three zones defining the state of transmission are shown. The probability of meeting a policy target, given a production elasticity range, is computed. The method is applied to France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US, and to Indonesia as an example of application in developing countries. Results: As of June 30, 2020, France, Germany, Italy and the UK have arrived in the green zone where relaxation can be considered. The US is still in the red zone where physical distancing still needs to be applied. France, Germany and Italy can set a policy target of maximum daily-cases of 500, while the UK has to make do with a target of 1,100 daily-cases. France, Germany, Italy and the UK still exhibit a relatively high risk of their daily-cases failing to meet the policy target or even rising. Indonesia is still in the red zone, so it comes as no surprise that the countrys daily-cases rose sharply after relaxation of physical distancing. Conclusions: Short-run health production function can be used to assess the state of COVID-19 transmission and to determine a risk-based physical distancing relaxation policy. Given its simplicity and minimum data requirement, the approach is very useful for developing countries which are unable to have reliable estimates of the reproduction number R. Follow-up research from this study may include estimating an economically optimal date for relaxing distancing measures and application of this method to other epidemics.","output":"When can physical distancing be relaxed?

The main idea is to study the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at the first stage and then provide efficient insights to estimate the necessary resources accordingly. The convex RO with Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) objective function is utilized to project the course of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. To validate the performance of the suggested model, a real-case study is investigated and compared to several well-known forecasting models including Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing with Trend Adjustment models. Furthermore, the effect of parameter uncertainties is examined using a set of sensitivity analyses. The results demonstrate that by increasing the degree (coefficient) of regression up to 8, MAD value decreases to 1378.12, and consequently, the corresponding equation becomes more accurate. On the other hand, from the 8th degree onwards, MAD value follows an upward trend. Furthermore, by increasing the level of regression uncertainty, MAD value follows a downward trend to reach 1309.28 and the estimation accuracy of the model increases accordingly.

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of \\"panic shopping\\" or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.","output":"Mathematical Modelling to Assess the Impact of Lockdown on COVID-19 Transmission in India: Model Development and Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Red blood cells (RBCs) release hemoglobin (Hb)-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) throughout their lifespan in the circulation, and especially during senescence, by spleen-facilitated vesiculation of their membrane. During ex vivo aging under blood bank conditions, the RBCs lose Hb, both in soluble form and inside EVs that accumulate as a part of storage lesion in the supernatant of the unit. Spontaneous hemolysis and vesiculation are increasingly promoted by the storage duration, but little is known about any physiological linkage between them. In the present study, we measured the levels of total extracellular and EV-enclosed Hb (EV-Hb) in units of whole blood (n = 36) or packed RBCs stored in either CPDA-1 (n = 99) or in CPD-SAGM additive solution (n = 46), in early, middle, and late storage. The spectrophotometry data were subjected to statistical analysis to detect possible correlation(s) between storage hemolysis and EV-Hb, as well as the threshold (if any) that determines the area of this dynamic association. It seems that the percentage of EV-Hb is negatively associated with hemolysis levels from middle storage onward by showing low to moderate correlation profiles in all strategies under investigation. Moreover, 0.17% storage hemolysis was determined as the potential cut-off, above which this inverse correlation is evident in non-leukoreduced CPDA units. Notably, RBC units with hemolysis levels > 0.17% are characterized by higher percentage of nanovesicles (<100 nm) over typical microvesicles (100-400 nm) compared with the lower hemolysis counterparts.

Emerging data have identified a deficiency of circulating arginine in patients with COVID-19. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that serves as key regulator of immune and vascular cell function. Arginine is metabolized by nitric oxide (NO) synthase to NO which plays a pivotal role in host defense and vascular health, whereas the catabolism of arginine by arginase to ornithine contributes to immune suppression and vascular disease. Notably, arginase activity is upregulated in COVID-19 patients in a disease-dependent fashion, favoring the production of ornithine and its metabolites from arginine over the synthesis of NO. This rewiring of arginine metabolism in COVID-19 promotes immune and endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and arterial thickening, fibrosis, and stiffening, which can lead to vascular occlusion, muti-organ failure, and death. Strategies that restore the plasma concentration of arginine, inhibit arginase activity, and/or enhance the bioavailability and potency of NO represent promising therapeutic approaches that may preserve immune function and prevent the development of severe vascular disease in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Targeting Arginine in COVID-19-Induced Immunopathology and Vasculopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we describe a case of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by alveolar air leakage syndrome without prior positive pressure ventilation.

METHODS: The electronic notes were reviewed for six patients being followed up by the Rheumatology service at Auckland District Health Board. Three patients were initially diagnosed and treated in neighbouring Counties Manukau District Health Board and later transferred to Auckland District Health Board. All had different initial treating clinicians at a time before any predefined treatment algorithm. Emphasis was placed on initial diagnosis and treatment, subsequent disease activity and changes in management. Local management was compared retrospectively with existing evidence relating to the treatment of anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. Ethical approval was not obtained, according to the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee exemption for audits and related activities. RESULTS: Six patients with a variety of clinical presentations were identified appropriately as having anti-MDA-5 DM with ILD. They were commenced on different immunosuppressive regimens, with treatment adjusted according to response and on-going disease activity. Four have achieved clinical and biochemical remission, a fifth has improving active disease, and the sixth is in the early stages of their illness.

The response to ESKD, particularly regarding kidney replacement therapy (KRT), depends on local disease burden, culture, and socioeconomics. Here, we explore geographic variation and global trends in ESKD incidence and prevalence and examine variations in KRT modality, practice patterns, and mortality. We conclude with a discussion on disparities in access to KRT and strategies to reduce ESKD global burden and to improve access to treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). SUMMARY From 2003 to 2016, incidence rates of treated ESKD were relatively stable in many higher income countries but rose substantially predominantly in East and Southeast Asia. The prevalence of treated ESKD has increased worldwide, likely due to improving ESKD survival, population demographic shifts, higher prevalence of ESKD risk factors, and increasing KRT access in countries with growing economies. Unadjusted 5-year survival of ESKD patients on KRT was 41% in the USA, 48% in Europe, and 60% in Japan. Dialysis is the predominant KRT in most countries, with hemodialysis being the most common modality. Variations in dialysis practice patterns account for some of the differences in survival outcomes globally. Worldwide, there is a greater prevalence of KRT at higher income levels, and the number of people who die prematurely because of lack of KRT access is estimated at up to 3 times higher than the number who receive treatment. Key Messages: Many people worldwide in need of KRT as a life-sustaining treatment do not receive it, mostly in LMICs where health care resources are severely limited. This large treatment gap demands a focus on population-based prevention strategies and development of affordable and cost-effective KRT. Achieving global equity in KRT access will require concerted efforts in advocating effective public policy, health care delivery, workforce capacity, education, research, and support from the government, private sector, nongovernmental, and professional organizations.","output":"Global Epidemiology of End-Stage Kidney Disease and Disparities in Kidney Replacement Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After global health catastrophe due to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a deep impact on the way we perceive our world and our everyday lives has been imprinted Till now, no specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for curing patients Ivermectin, the broad-spectrum macrocyclic lactone has proven to exert antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus and now capability to reduce viral RNA up to 5,000-fold after 48 h of infection with SARS-CoV-2 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Biomedica is the property of Knowledge Bylanes and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Ivermectin: An Anti-Parasitic Drug that has Potential for Repurposing for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a considerable and long-lasting social and economic impact on the world Along with other potential challenges across different domains, it has brought numerous cybersecurity challenges that must be tackled timely to protect victims and critical infrastructure Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria As an outcome of this research study;we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are;ransomware, trojans, and bots We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic Lastly, we identified the open challenges, general recommendations, and prospective solutions for future work from the researcher and practitioner communities by using the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics","output":"A Multivocal Literature Review on Growing Social Engineering Based Cyber-Attacks/Threats During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Prospective Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its primary cell-surface receptor. ACE2 is a key enzyme in the counter-regulatory pathway of the broader renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that has been implicated in a broad array of human pathology. The RAS is composed of two competing pathways that work in opposition to each other: the conventional arm involving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) generating angiotensin-2 and the more recently identified ACE2 pathway that generates angiotensin (1C7). Following the original SARS pandemic, additional studies suggested that coronaviral binding to ACE2 resulted in downregulation of the membrane-bound enzyme. Given the similarities between the two viruses, many have posited a similar process with SARS-CoV-2. Proponents of this ACE2 deficiency model argue that downregulation of ACE2 limits its enzymatic function, thereby skewing the delicate balance between the two competing arms of the RAS. In this review we critically examine this model. The available data remain incomplete but are consistent with the possibility that the broad multisystem dysfunction of COVID-19 is due in large part to functional ACE2 deficiency leading to angiotensin imbalance with consequent immune dysregulation and endothelial cell dysfunction.","output":"Functional ACE2 deficiency leading to angiotensin imbalance in the pathophysiology of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemia, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has been largely applied. Few data are available about predictors of NIV failure in critical COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. The aim of this study is to analyze clinical and laboratory features able to predict non-invasive ventilation success in avoiding endotracheal intubation. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in our COVID-19 ICU during a 6-month period. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were extracted from electronic and paper medical records and anonymously collected. RESULTS: Eighty-two severe COVID-19 patients were supported by NIV at ICU admission. The median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 125 [98.5C177.7]. NIV failed in 44 cases (53%). Patients who experienced NIV failure had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (median value 4) compared to those who were dismissed without endotracheal intubation (median 2, p < 0.0001). At Cox regression analysis, the Charlson Comorbidity Index represented a predictive factor related to NIV failure. PaO(2)/FiO(2), CPK, INR, and AT III at ICU admission showed a significant relationship with the outcome, when single variables were adjusted for the Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: The Charlson Comorbidity Index may be helpful to stratify patients risk of NIV failure in a severe COVID-19 population; even if this study, retrospective design does not allow definitive conclusions.

Unfortunately, no specific treatment or vaccine is available to date. OBJECTIVE Here, we aimed to predict the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and protein targets from the human body for some flavone molecules (kaempferol, morin, pectolinarin, myricitrin, and herbacetin) in comparison to synthetic compounds (hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, ribavirin, ritonavir, AMD-070, favipiravir). METHODS Using MOE software and advanced bioinformatics and cheminformatics portals, we conducted an extensive analysis based on various structural and functional features of compounds, such as their amphiphilic field, flexibility, and steric features. The structural similarity analysis of natural and synthetic compounds was performed using Tanimoto coefficients. The interactions of some compounds with SARS-CoV-2 3CLprotease or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were described using 2D protein-ligand interaction diagrams based on known crystal structures. The potential targets of considered compounds were identified using the SwissTargetPrediction web tool. RESULTS Our results showed that remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir present a strong structural similarity which may be correlated to their similar biological activity. As common molecular targets of compounds in the human body, ritonavir, kaempferol, morin, and herbacetin can activate multidrug resistance-associated proteins, while remdesivir, ribavirin, and pectolinarin appear as ligands for adenosine receptors. CONCLUSION Our evaluation recommends remdesivir, pectolinarin, and ritonavir as promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","output":"Structural bioinformatics used to predict the protein targets of remdesivir and flavones in SARS-CoV-2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowdfunding is emerging as a significant means by which to finance and advance the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Generating financial support for the SDGs is now of even more importance because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 However, little research on sustainability crowdfunding has been conducted, particularly with respect to how behavioral influences, such as personality and subjective well-being, affect the willingness of individuals to financially support the different SDGs To fill this gap, a theoretically comprehensive research model including the big five personality traits typology, value on SDGs, attachment to sustainability crowdfunding, subjective well-being, and three groups of SDGs was constructed and tested Results reveal that agreeableness has the highest effect on value on SDGs among five personalities, followed by openness and conscientiousness Unexpectedly, extraversion has a negative impact on value on SDGs and neuroticism has an insignificant effect on value on SDGs Value on SDGs has a great effect on attachment, followed by subjective well-being Attachment has the greatest effect on subjective well-being within this research model Comparing fair distribution, efficient allocation, and sustainable scale groups of SDGs shows substantial differences with respect to the hypotheses ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Behavioral influences on crowdfunding SDG initiatives: The importance of personality and subjective well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT We carried out this study to evaluate the intercurrence of tuberculosis and enzootic leukosis in dairy cattle herds in 8 districts of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, by establishing the prevalence of bovines reagent to specific diagnostic tests, and to also verify the correlation between enzootic leucosis, cattle tuberculosis, the leukocytes count and lymphocytes count among the cattle studied.

To overcome the limitations of classical immunotherapy, we have demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of NbF12-10 bispecific nanobody at preclinical level. Nanobodies were developed against BotI analogues belonging to a distinct structural and antigenic group of scorpion toxins, occurring in the MENA region. From Buthus occitanus tunetanus venom, BotI-like toxin was purified. The 41 N-terminal amino acid residues were sequenced, and the LD(50) was estimated at 40 ng/mouse. The BotI-like toxin was used for dromedary immunization. An immune VHH library was constructed, and after screening, two nanobodies were selected with nanomolar and sub-nanomolar affinity and recognizing an overlapping epitope. NbBotI-01 was able to neutralize 50% of the lethal effect of 13 LD(50) BotI-like toxins in mice when injected by i.c.v route, whereas NbBotI-17 neutralized 50% of the lethal effect of 7 LD(50).

The study uses data from the Public Opinion in the European Union (EU) in Time of Coronavirus Crisis. Third Round survey. The sample consists of 1036 individuals aged between 16 and 54 years. To measure inequality, the Erreygers' Concentration Index (CI) is calculated, using social class as the ranking variable. To identify the characteristics of those experiencing income loss, a logistic regression model is fitted using the region of residence and several demographic and socioeconomic variables as potential predictors. According to the results, social inequality does not exist with regard to income loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, our findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on the incomes of individuals from all social classes in Greece. According to the results of the logistic regression model, the odds of experiencing income loss are higher for residents of the Aegean Islands and Crete but also for self-employed, part-time employed, and unemployed individuals. These findings indicate the negative influence of the pandemic on Greek tourism and on sectors employing a large proportion of non-standard workers.

Prolonged viral shedding is common, particularly among immunosuppressed patients. Thus, ongoing detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may delay transplant and prolong hospitalization. We report a case of an LTx recipient who developed COVID-19-associated lung injury with prolonged viral shedding that persisted following redo LTx. Case Report A 48-year-old man developed COVID-19 17 months after bilateral LTx. His illness rapidly progressed to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring bilevel ventilation and prone positioning. He was treated with corticosteroids, remdesevir, convalescent plasma, anticoagulation, and reduced immunosuppression. Tocilizumab was not administered as data supporting its use was unavailable. Despite aggressive therapy, he remained hypoxemic and developed radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. SARS-CoV-2 was persistently isolated between November 2020 and April 2021; the PCR cycle threshold in March 2021 was 32, indicating a low level of viral RNA. There was no evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, after 2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs in April, he underwent redo bilateral LTx in May 2021, 163 days after his initial diagnosis. Postoperative critical illness myopathy required prolonged mechanical ventilation, nutrition via a feeding tube, and 19 days at an acute rehabilitation center. Routine surveillance bronchoscopy 40 days after retransplant revealed SARS-CoV-2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and again in a nasal wash sample. He had no COVID-19 symptoms at the time of viral isolation, and inflammatory markers were normal. He was empirically treated with casirivimab and imdevimab, with resolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolation 8 days later. Summary Prolonged viral shedding is common in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19; however, ongoing viral isolation is not a reliable indicator of active viral replication and transmissibility. Our patient had persistent SARS-CoV-2 isolation after redo LTx with no evidence of COVID-19 or allograft injury. Thus, persistent viral shedding alone may not be an absolute contraindication to LTx and additional factors such as PCR cycle threshold and time from original infection should be considered.","output":"Persistent Subclinical SARS-CoV-2 Isolation After Redo Lung Transplant for COVID-19-Induced Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 remains poorly understood.

Importantly, these auto-IgM preferentially recognize primary human lung cells in vitro, including pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells. By using a combination of flow cytometry, analytical proteome microarray technology, and LDH-release cytotoxicity assays, we identify high-affinity, complement-fixing, auto-reactive IgM directed against 260 candidate auto-antigens, including numerous molecules preferentially expressed on the cellular membranes of pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, and renal tissues.

We included patients that described headache if the headache was not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients were interviewed by two neurologists. RESULTS: We screened 580 patients and included 130 (mean age 56 years, 64% female). Headache was the first symptom of the infection in 26% of patients and appeared within 24 hours in 62% of patients.

Why has local government debt been allowed to grow with little direct intervention from central authorities? We argue that it has much to do with a grand bargain between the central government and localities during the 1994 fiscal recentralization reform. While much scholarly attention has been paid to the consequences of the 1994 reform that left localities with a tremendous fiscal gap, our findings show that Beijing in fact gave localities the green light to create new backdoor financing institutions that counteracted the impact of fiscal recentralization. In essence, these institutions were the quid pro quo offered to localities to sustain their incentive for local state-led growth after 1994. The bargain worked, and growth continued. The drawback, however, was that Chinas economic growth has been accompanied by the accumulation of local government debt with little transparency and central control. When the global financial crisis slowed growth, and local deficits and debts spiked, Beijing began to shut down backdoor financing and opened front-door options that were transparent and under the control of national authoritiesbut with limited success.

The search was repeated on 20 January 2022 to identify studies published since our initial search. Included studies were quality appraised using the British Medical Journal Checklist for economic submissions adapted for cost of illness studies. Results were synthesized in a structured narrative. Of the 138 included studies, 38 reported cost estimates for VI due to an unspecified cause and 100 reported costs for one of the leading causes. These 138 studies provided 155 regional cost estimates. Fourteen studies reported global data; 103/155 (66%) regional estimates were from high-income countries. Costs were most commonly reported using a societal (n = 48) or healthcare system perspective (n = 25). Most studies included only a limited number of cost components. Large variations in methodology and reporting across studies meant cost estimates varied considerably. The average quality assessment score was 78% (range 35-100%); the most common weaknesses were the lack of sensitivity analysis and insufficient disaggregation of costs. There was substantial variation across studies in average treatment costs per patient for most conditions, including refractive error correction (range $12-$201 ppp), cataract surgery (range $54-$3654 ppp), glaucoma (range $351-$1354 ppp) and AMD (range $2209-$7524 ppp). Future cost estimates of the economic burden of VI and its major causes will be improved by the development and adoption of a reference case for eye health.

The studies of the diversity of species, taxonomy, mechanisms of evolution, geographic distribution, and mechanisms of interaction of these pathogens with the host have greatly increased in recent years. Furthermore, the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and advanced metagenomics approaches have enabled the elucidation of viromes and the identification of many viral agents in a large number of plant species. As a result, determining the nomenclature and taxonomically classifying geminiviruses turned into complex tasks. In addition, the gene responsible for viral replication (particularly, the viruses belonging to the genus Mastrevirus) may be spliced due to the use of the transcriptional/splicing machinery in the host cells. However, the current tools have limitations concerning the identification of introns. RESULTS This study proposes a new method, designated Fangorn Forest (F2), based on machine learning approaches to classify genera using an ab initio approach, i.e., using only the genomic sequence, as well as to predict and classify genes in the family Geminiviridae. In this investigation, nine genera of the family Geminiviridae and their related satellite DNAs were selected. We obtained two training sets, one for genus classification, containing attributes extracted from the complete genome of geminiviruses, while the other was made up to classify geminivirus genes, containing attributes extracted from ORFs taken from the complete genomes cited above. Three ML algorithms were applied on those datasets to build the predictive models: support vector machines, using the sequential minimal optimization training approach, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. RF demonstrated a very high predictive power, achieving 0.966, 0.964, and 0.995 of precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC), respectively, for genus classification. For gene classification, RF could reach 0.983, 0.983, and 0.998 of precision, recall, and AUC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, Fangorn Forest is proven to be an efficient method for classifying genera of the family Geminiviridae with high precision and effective gene prediction and classification.

It has made commuting much easier and faster. With the increase in population, there has been a massive surge in the number of passengers leading to crowding at platforms and bus stops. Since the frequency of buses and rapid transit is uneven and lacks proper real-Time tracking of buses, we see a vast discrepancy in the number of passengers traveling. Such discrepancies not only have a vast economic impact but also make travelling by buses difficult for regular commuters, also increasing the travelling time. Especially considering the COVID 19 situation, it can cause a lot of problems. Thus, there is a need for a system that can adjust itself according to the number of passengers and real-Time tracking of public transportation systems available for passengers.With this paper, we aim towards providing an intelligent transportation system using real-Time data to manage the frequency of mass transit systems by crowdsourcing people on bus stands in real-Time using CCTV, analyzing the data, and making decisions realtime on the frequency of these mass transit systems by analyzing data through the help of data science and machine learning which would help in automation of rapid transit systems. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Modern Technology for Evolving Mass Public Transportation in Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complex and evolving picture of COVID-19-related mortality highlights the need for data to guide the response.

Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88% of sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, respectively. Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV displays 10C20 times greater affinity for its cognate host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5 end of + ssRNA genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated replication-transcription molecular events lead to the synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural and accessory proteins participating in structure formation and various molecular functions of virus, respectively. These multiple structural proteins assemble and encapsulate genomic RNA (gRNA), resulting in numerous viral progenies, which eventually exit the host cell, and spread infection to rest of the body.

However, despite the proven efficacy, the high cost of the therapy resulted in limitation of the widespread use and unequal access to the care. The introduction of biosimilars, which are much cheaper relative to original drugs, may facilitate the achievement of the therapy by a much broader spectrum of patients.

Today, the world faces a general health crisis of COVID-19. The number of people infected by the virus and the increasing number of deaths may result in the city-design strategies. The effect of this pandemic shows the importance of urban design and its effect on viral infections and its role in the health of populations, but this relationship is unclear and ignored;that is why we face this pandemic today. In this study, we are looking to protect the environment and human health by enhancing air quality by designing a new urban space in crowded cities called City Lung and green roofs to reduce the effect of air pollutions. Moreover, cleaning the air inside high-density districts by controlling pollution sources was a vital link observed between the lockdown and the reduction of CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper will start by searching for a crowded study area with high traffic density, study the impact of urban form and air quality effects on human health, and suggest solutions to this study area. In the beginning, ENVI-MET 4.4.5 software was used to simulate the carbon emission values and validate these values by CI-340 lightweight hand-held photosynthesis system device to get readings to evaluate the urban air quality and its effect. The present study reveals that algae stations improved the oxygen ratio 1.65 times in the study area than the existing values. Also, green roofing as a solution effectively affects air quality near the ground, as an alternative for the green areas in crowded cities and pedestrians areas. This study enables urban planners to determine more greening principles for better urban living environments in high-density cities.

A possible approach to reduce drunk driving rates is to identify which individuals are at risk of such behavior and establish targeted prevention. Simply asking individuals about drunk driving in real-world contexts would be problematic because of potential deception. The use of implicit measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) could overcome this problem because they are less controllable than self-reports and thus less susceptible to deception. However, previous studies have shown poor predictive utility of implicit measures for drunk driving behavior. The current studies aimed to test the predictive utility of a variant of the IAT designed to assess beliefs about past driving under the influence (the P-DUI-IAT). METHOD Study 1 (N = 216) tested whether the P-DUI-IAT could predict self-reported prior drunk driving and future likelihood of drunk driving. We also examined incremental predictive validity of the P-DUI-IAT for these outcomes. Study 2 (N = 159) examined whether results from Study 1 were reproducible. RESULTS In both studies, results showed that the P-DUI-IAT discriminated well between participants who had engaged in drunk driving and participants who had not. The P-DUI-IAT also showed independent and incremental predictive validity for past drunk driving and future likelihood of drunk driving. CONCLUSIONS These studies provided initial evidence for the predictive utility of the P-DUI-IAT for drunk driving. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The P-DUI-IAT is a promising tool for identifying which individuals are at risk of drunk driving.

We propose here a two-locus genome-wide test for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data.

It is a case-only method, which has several advantages over classic case-control tests, in particular by avoiding recruitment of controls. Our simulation studies based on real WES data identified two major sources of type I error inflation in this case-only test: linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Both were corrected by specific procedures. Moreover, our case-only approach is more powerful than the corresponding case-control test for detecting digenic interactions in various population stratification scenarios.

However, patients with early ischaemic signs could be at increased risk of haemorrhage after alteplase treatment, and little information is available about whether pre-existing structural signs, which are common in older patients, affect response to alteplase. We aimed to investigate the association between imaging signs on brain CT and outcomes after alteplase. METHODS IST-3 was a multicentre, randomised controlled trial of intravenous alteplase (09 mg/kg) versus control within 6 h of acute ischaemic stroke. The primary outcome was independence at 6 months (defined as an Oxford Handicap Scale [OHS] score of 0-2). 3035 patients were enrolled to IST-3 and underwent prerandomisation brain CT. Experts who were unaware of the random allocation assessed scans for early signs of ischaemia (tissue hypoattenuation, infarct extent, swelling, and hyperattenuated artery) and pre-existing signs (old infarct, leukoaraiosis, and atrophy). In this prespecified analysis, we assessed interactions between these imaging signs, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (a secondary outcome in IST-3) and independence at 6 months, and alteplase, adjusting for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and time to randomisation. This trial is registered at ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN25765518. FINDINGS 3017 patients were assessed in this analysis, of whom 1507 were allocated alteplase and 1510 were assigned control. A reduction in independence was predicted by tissue hypoattenuation (odds ratio 066, 95% CI 055-081), large lesion (051, 038-068), swelling (059, 046-075), hyperattenuated artery (059, 047-075), atrophy (074, 059-094), and leukoaraiosis (072, 059-087). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was predicted by old infarct (odds ratio 172, 95% CI 118-251), tissue hypoattenuation (154, 104-227), and hyperattenuated artery (154, 103-229). Some combinations of signs increased the absolute risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (eg, both old infarct and hyperattenuated artery, excess with alteplase 138%, 95% CI 69-207; both signs absent, excess 32%, 14-51). However, no imaging findings-individually or combined-modified the effect of alteplase on independence or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. INTERPRETATION Some early ischaemic and pre-existing signs were associated with reduced independence at 6 months and increased symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Although no interaction was noted between brain imaging signs and effects of alteplase on these outcomes, some combinations of signs increased some absolute risks. Pre-existing signs should be considered, in addition to early ischaemic signs, during the assessment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9.

In March 2020, faced to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown measures, the CIC-1427 had to rapidly adapt its operating procedures to ensure the safety of both patients and staff. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Ensuring optimal management of patients included in early phase clinical trials, while respecting the good clinical and professional practices (GCP/GPP) of the CICs protocol sponsors' requirements, patients' safety and clinical research multidisciplinary staff safety (nurses, caregivers' assistants (AS), clinical research assistants (CRA), clinical trial coordinators (CTC), project leaders, health executive and investigating physicians), in the context of the health crisis related to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Due to their activity, requiring on-site presence, each staff member of the CIC-1427 clinical research team had to adapt their daily activity to the constraints of the health crisis. New specific procedures were quickly developed to deal with the pandemic. Most of the on-site medical visits were replaced by virtual consults with biological assessments in the local laboratories. \\"Remote monitoring\\" replaced on-site monitoring visits. Treatments were sent to each patient's home via couriers after agreement of the CPPs of each protocol (Committee for the Protection of Persons).

Despite its potential benefits, barriers commonly exist to its optimal implementation in daily clinical routine. Our purpose is to analyze peer-review process at our institution. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on our group peer-review process, we quantified the rate of plan changes, time and resources needed for this process. Prospectively, data on cases presented at our institutional peer-review conference attended by physicians, resident physicians and physicists were collected. Items such as time to present per case, type of patient (adult or pediatric), treatment intent, dose, aimed technique, disease location and receipt of previous radiation were gathered. Cases were then analyzed to determine the rate of major change, minor change and plan rejection after presentation as well as the median time per session. RESULTS: Over a period of 4 weeks, 148 cases were reviewed. Median of attendants was six physicians, three in-training-physicians and one physicist. Median time per session was 38 (4C72) minutes. 59.5% of cases presented in 1C4 min, 32.4% in 5C9 min and 8.1% in  10 min. 79.1% of cases were accepted without changes, 11.5% with minor changes, 6% with major changes and 3.4% were rejected with indication of new presentation. Most frequent reason of change was contouring corrections (53.8%) followed by dose or fractionation (26.9%).

As more drug discovery efforts aim to disrupt proteinCprotein interactions, it is becoming increasingly common to encounter systems that utilize avidity effects and to study these systems using surface-based technologies, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry. However, heterogeneity introduced from multivalent binding interactions complicates the analysis of the resulting sensorgram. A frequently applied practice is to fit the data based on a 1:1 binding model, and if the fit does not describe the data adequately, then the experimental setup is changed to favor a 1:1 binding interaction. This reductionistic approach is informative but not always biologically relevant. Therefore, we aimed to develop an SPR-based assay that would reduce the heterogeneity to enable the determination of the kinetic rate constants for multivalent binding interactions using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a model system. We employed a combinatorial approach to generate a sensor surface that could distinguish between monovalent and multivalent interactions.

A very strict lockdown at home was imposed with a tough restriction of mobility. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this exceptional scenario on glucose profile of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) prone to hypoglycaemia using sensor-augmented pump (SAP). METHODS: Patients with T1D prone to hypoglycaemia using SAP (640G Medtronic-Minimed?) for at least 6 months under the funding of a National Health Service were included in an observational, retrospective study. Data were collected in two periods: pre-lockdown (PL), February 23rd-March 7th and within lockdown (WL), April 1st to 14th 2020. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of time in target glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL (TIR). Additional glucometric data and total daily insulin were also analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were included: 33 women, age 46.17  13.0 years and disease duration of 30.2  12.0 years. TIR 70-180 mg/dL (67.6  11.8 vs. 69.8  12.0%), time > 180 (28.1  13.6 vs. 25.5  13.1%), time > 250 (6.9  6.1 vs. 5.1  4.8) and estimated HbA1c (6.94  0.8 vs. 6.75  0.7%) significantly improved (PL vs. WL, respectively, p < 0.05).

To that end the research is based on data mining methods (3D bins and emerging hot-spots) and exploratory geo-statistical analysis (Global Moran's Index, Nearest Neighbourhood and Ordinary Least Square analyses, among others). The study identifies space-time patterns that show significant hot-spots and demonstrates a high presence of the virus at building level in neighbourhoods where residential and economic uses are mixed. Knowing the spatial behaviour of the virus is strategically important for proposing geo-prevention keys, reducing spread and balancing trade-offs between potential health gains and economic burdens resulting from interventions to deal with the pandemic.","output":"Data mining and socio-spatial patterns of COVID-19: geo-prevention keys for tackling the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that the experiences of frontline primary health care professionals during COVID-19 are important to understand how they respond and act under situations of pandemic as the gatekeepers in primary health care system. School nurses are primary health care professionals who lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic manner to address the needs of schoolchildren and school personnel. There are rising mental health concerns of frontline health care professionals with anxiety and panic disorders, somatic symptoms, and feeling isolated. No studies use a qualitative study approach to document community frontline school nursing professionals' experiences and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, understanding the school nurses' experiences and challenges to fight against COVID-19 in the communities is important. PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the experiences of school nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. METHODS: A qualitative study design adopted the principles of thematic analysis. Nineteen school nurses were recruited to participate in individual semistructured interviews and shared their roles and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Three themes indicated the school nurses' expand professional responsibilities to fight against COVID-19 emerged from the data analysis. These were \\"Managing Stress,\\" \\"Navigating the School Through the Pandemic,\\" and \\"Raising the Profile of the School Nurse Professional,\\" DISCUSSION: Findings reveal the important role of school nursing professionals in minimizing the community-wide risk posed by pandemics and the need to integrate them into planning and implementation of school health policies and guidelines in the primary health care system. This essential role in schools is necessary to assess, implement, monitor, prevent, and reduce the spread of virus in school communities and to minimize the burden to and extra health care resources utilized in the acute care setting during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A qualitative exploration of the experiences of school nurses during COVID-19 pandemic as the frontline primary health care professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to develop the learning abilities of elementary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing cooperative relationships between teachers and parents.

The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of two interventions on integrative argumentation: one of them was focused on the product features of argumentative texts; and the other one on the processes involved in the written argumentation. Sixty-six undergraduate students participated voluntarily. As an academic task, they were asked to write a pre-test synthesis after reading two sources which presented contradictory positions about an educational issue, then to read two new texts about a different but equivalent issue, and write a post-test synthesis following one of two types of instructional virtual environments. The instructions, implemented in Moodle, presented similar tools, employing videos, graphic organizers, and exercises. The first condition (n = 33) focused on the linguistic features while the second (n = 33), focused on the process, including explicit instruction and a script with critical questions to guide the reading and writing processes. In this study we have also analyzed how the students in the process condition answered some of the critical questions. The results show that the level of integration of the written products improved in both conditions, although this improvement was more pronounced in the process intervention. Nonetheless, the products that achieved medium and maximum integration were still limited. Despite the lack of a relationship between how students answered the critical questions and the level of integration in their post-test, the case analysis highlights certain educational implications and further research.

In this study, we looked at adopters expectations for dog ownership prior to adoption and their experience with dog behavior in the first days, weeks, and months following adoption relative to the risk of return. We found owners who returned their dog to the shelter within three months of adoption had higher expectations for their dog to be healthy, exhibit desirable behavior, and for the humanCdog bond compared with adopters who did not return their dogs. There were no differences in expectations for ownership responsibilities and challenges between returning and non-returning owners. We also found two-thirds of owners experienced some behavioral problems following adoption, although behaviors such as training difficulty and fear decreased over time. Our findings may be useful for animal shelters to reduce returns by ensuring adopters have realistic expectations about the humanCdog relationship and the occurrence of behavioral problems. ABSTRACT: Millions of animals are adopted from animal shelters in the United States each year, although some are returned post-adoption, which can decrease both the animals chances of future adoptions and the owners willingness to adopt again. In this study, we investigated the impact of adopter expectations for ownership and animal behavioral problems on post-adoptive dog returns at a large animal shelter in South Carolina. Between JuneCSeptember 2021, 132 dog adopters completed a survey about their expectations for ownership through Qualtrics. Twenty-nine adopters returned their dogs to the shelter within three months of adoption, with a median length of ownership of eight days. Owners completed follow-up questionnaires about their perceptions of adoption and dog behavior at two days, two weeks, and four months post-adoption. Categorical principal component analysis revealed three factors pertaining to adopters expectations for ownership. Independent t-tests showed returning owners had significantly higher expectations for dog behavior and health (t = ?2.32, p = 0.02) and the humanCdog bond compared with non-returning owners (t = ?2.36, p = 0.02). Expectations for ownership responsibilities did not differ between the groups. Two-thirds of adopters experienced dog behavioral problems post-adoption, although training difficulty decreased significantly between two days and four months (F = 5.22, p = 0.01) and nonsocial fear decreased between two weeks and four months post-adoption (X(2) = 10.17, p = 0.01). Shelters may benefit from utilizing adoption counselling to ensure adopters understand the potential for dog behavioral problems in the early stages of ownership and develop appropriate expectations for the humanCdog relationship. Post-adoption behavioral support may also help some owners to overcome behavioral difficulties as their dogs adapt to the new environment.","output":"Returning a Shelter Dog: The Role of Owner Expectations and Dog Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether, a bioactive flavonoid isolated for the first time from Alnus rugosa, was explored for its capability to relieve memory deficits and decrease oxidative stress. We examined the neuropharmacological effects of baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether on scopolamine (Sco)-induced zebrafish (Danio rerio) anxiety, amnesia, and brain oxidative stress and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Anxiety-like behavior, exploratory behavior, and memory performance were measured using novel tank-diving test (NTT), Y-maze, and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. For 10 days, baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether (1, 3, and 5 g/L) was administered through immersion, whereas Sco (100 M) was delivered 30 min before behavioral tests. Treatment with baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether reduced anxiety and memory impairment, and increased exploratory behavior in specific tests, along with significant protection from neuronal oxidative stress in the brain tissue of Sco-treated zebrafish. Antioxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities of baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether in the Sco-induced zebrafish were further confirmed using in vivo assays. In Sco-treated zebrafish, baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether regulated cholinergic function by inhibiting AChE activity.

Their advantage is that they can be embedded within social networks, and provide a natural language (NL) interface that enables their use by non-technical users. While there are many emerging platforms for building chatbots, their construction remains a highly technical, challenging task. In this paper, we propose the use of chatbots to facilitate querying domain-specific models. This way, instead of relying on technical query languages (e.g., OCL), models are queried using NL as this can be more suitable for non-technical users. To avoid manual programming, our solution is based on the automatic synthesis of the model query chatbots from a domain meta-model.

However, with the growth of enterprises business, their negative externalities on the environment have gradually become prominent, further affecting sustainable consumption. The relationships between businesses, the environment, and consumption have become the focus of attention. Chinas fast-growing bottled water companies face similar challenges. The pollution that occurs due to bottled water packaging poses great threats to consumers. Hence, this study extended the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by integrating three risk aspects, namely, water pollution risk perception (WPRP), non-degradable package pollution risk perception (NPPRP), and false information risk perception (FIRP), to examine the consumers perceptions toward these risk aspects before purchasing bottled water online. This study employed a cross-sectional approach to collect data from online consumers via a survey method. A total of 401 valid samples were collected and then analyzed via a structural equation model using the AMOS statistical package. The results showed that attitude (AT), subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavior control (PBC) toward online bottled water purchase had significant and positive effects on the consumers purchase intentions (PIs). However, under the influence of risk perception, the consumers attitudes, SNs and PBC became suppressed by WPRP, and SN became suppressed due to the impact of FIRP. Furthermore, the negative impacts of NPPRP and FIRP on PI were partially mediated by AT, SN and PBC. Meanwhile, WPRP imposed the most significant direct effect on PI. The study results will help businesses to develop better online strategies to reduce the risk perception of bottled water and provide theoretical value and practical guidance for realizing sustainable consumption.","output":"Determinants of Intention to Purchase Bottled Water Based on Business Online Strategy in China: The Role of Perceived Risk in the Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improvements in genetic and genomic technology have enabled field-deployable molecular laboratories and these have been deployed in a variety of epidemics that capture headlines.

One hypothesis is that population in SSA has been exposed to other coronaviruses prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in some degree of cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. Our goal was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies in pre-pandemic plasma samples collected from SSA and USA. METHOD: Pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma samples from SSA and USA were collected and tested by immunofluorescence assay against the spike and nucleocapid proteins of all known human coronaviruses (HCoV). RESULTS: Significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 serological cross-reactivity was detected in samples from SSA compared to USA. Majority of these cross-reactive samples cross-recognized SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein together with recognition of spike proteins from other HCoVs. Since nucleocapsid proteins from HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected by majority of samples, it implicates prior exposure to these two HCoVs as the likely source for cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Low SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in SSA appears to correlate with pre-pandemic serological cross-recognition of HCoVs, which are substantially more prevalent in SSA than USA.","output":"High prevalence of pre-existing serological cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Sahara Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients have a high risk of developing primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection and reactivation.

Cellular immunity against various VZV antigens was analyzed by interferon-gamma ELISpot. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of recipients with versus without prior shingles (n = 36 and n = 43, respectively) showed approximately twofold higher VZV-specific responses prior to and post vaccination. After the first and second vaccination, ELISpot responses towards the glycoprotein E were significantly higher in males versus females (median of spots increment 18 versus 1 and 17 versus 4, respectively, p  0.02 each). Multivariate analysis showed that shingles and sex both impacts significantly on VZV immunity. Whereas vaccination-induced changes could hardly be detected after stimulation with a whole VZV antigen, there was a significant increase in responses towards glycoprotein E after vaccination (p < 0.005). These data indicate that vaccination with Shingrix? augmented cellular, VZV-specific immunity in HSCT recipients.

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social-distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, and contact-tracing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of an anti-COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to build the community herd immunity needed to effectively control and eliminate the pandemic. This study is based on the design and use of a mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19. An analytical expression for the minimum number of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with mortality data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Florida, as well as for the entire US, show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, the minimum herd immunity threshold for the entire US, state of New York and state of Florida are, respectively, 90%, 84% and 85%. Furthermore, it was shown that, while a significantly large increase in vaccination rate (from baseline) is necessarily needed to eliminate COVID-19 from the entire US, the pandemic can be eliminated from the states of New York and Florida if the vaccination rate is marginally increased (by as low as 10%) from its baseline value. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US or in the two states of New York and Florida is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with a public mask use program or an effective social-distancing measure. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold. Finally, it is shown that the vaccination program is more likely to lead to COVID-19 elimination in the state of Florida, followed by the state of New York and then the entire US.","output":"Will an imperfect vaccine curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: &nbsp;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted HIV prevention strategies globally. However, changes in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and HIV-related behaviors, and their associations with medication adherence among MSM PrEP users remains unclear since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Methods:&nbsp;A longitudinal observational study of HIV-negative MSM PrEP users was conducted in four Chinese metropolises from February to March 2020, assessing the changes in PrEP adherence and HIV-related behaviours before and during the COVID-19. The primary outcome was poor PrEP adherence determined from self-reported missing at least one PrEP dose in the previous month. We used mulitivariable logistic regression to determine factors correlated with poor adherence during the COVID-19. Findings:&nbsp;We enrolled 791 eligible participants (418 [528%] in daily PrEP, 373 [472%] in event-driven PrEP). Compared with the data conducted before the COVID-19, the proportion of PrEP users decreased from 979% to 643%, and the proportion of poor PrEP adherence increased from 23.6% to 501% during the COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 324, 95% confidence interval (CI) 261C402). While the percentage of condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with regular partners (118% vs 257%) and with casual partners (44% vs 90%) both significantly increased. The proportion of those who were tested for HIV decreased from 501% to 259%. Factors correlated with poor PrEP adherence during the COVID-19 included not being tested for HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=138 [95% CI: 100, 191]), using condoms consistently with regular partners (vs. never, aOR=219 [95% CI: 116, 413]) and being married or cohabitating with a woman (vs. not married, aOR=308 [95% CI: 160, 595]).

We discuss methods for modeling 3D chromatin structures, with focus on a minimalistic polymer model which inverts population Hi-C into high-resolution, high-coverage single-cell chromatin conformations. Utilizing only basic physical properties such as nuclear volume and no adjustable parameters, this model uncovers a few specific Hi-C interactions (15-35 for enhancerrich loci in human cells) that can fold chromatin into individual conformations consistent with single-cell imaging, Dip-C, and FISH-measured genomic distance distributions. Aggregating an ensemble of conformations also reproduces population Hi-C interaction frequencies. Furthermore, this single-cell modeling approach allows quantification of structural heterogeneity and discovery of specific many-body units of chromatin interactions. This minimalistic 3D chromatin polymer model has revealed a number of insights: 1) chromatin scaling rules are a result of volume-confined polymers; 2) TADs form as a byproduct of 3D chromatin folding driven by specific interactions; 3) chromatin folding at many loci is driven by a small number of specific interactions; 4) cell subpopulations equipped with different chromatin structural scaffolds are developmental stage-dependent; and 5) characterization of the functional landscape and epigenetic marks of many-body units which are simultaneously spatially co-interacting within enhancer-rich, euchromatic regions.

The experiment varied test provider (public clinic versus international health organization), proximity to illness, and a confidentiality reassurance. We find that Malawians expect higher uptake of testing in their community when the international health organization offered the test rather than a public clinic, an effect we attribute to higher trust in the organization and/or perceptions of greater capacity to ensure procedural integrity. The confidentiality reassurance did not substantially alter beliefs about the privacy of results, but did increase doubts about the willingness of community members to get tested in a public health clinic.

It is expressed on the cell surface and contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif and a di-acidic motif, which may be crucial for its intracellular trafficking. However the role of these motifs is not fully understood in the case of 3a protein. METHODS: The subcellular distribution of the 3a protein was studied by immunofluorescence staining of cells transfected with wild type and mutant constructs along with markers for different intracellular compartments. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to estimate the mRNA where as western blotting was carried out to detect protein levels of wild type and mutant 3a proteins. In vitro transcription- translation was performed to estimate cell free protein synthesis. RESULTS: While the wild type 3a protein is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, the protein with mutations in the tyrosine and valine residues within the YXXV motif (YXX) accumulated in the Golgi compartment. However the 3a protein with mutations within the EXD di-acidic motif (EXD) showed an intracellular distribution similar to the wild type protein. Increased retention of the YXX protein in the Golgi compartment also increased its association with lipid droplets. The YXX protein also expressed at significantly lower levels compared to the wild type 3a protein, which was reversed with Brefeldin A and Aprotinin. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the YXX motif of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is necessary for Golgi to plasma membrane transport, in the absence of which the protein is targeted to lysosomal degradation compartment via lipid droplets.","output":"The YXX motif within the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3a protein is crucial for its intracellular transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stabilization of arsenic sulfur slag (As?S slag) is of high importance to prevent the release of deadly As pollutants into environment. However, the molecular understanding on the stability of As?S slag is missing, which in turn restricts the development of robust approach to solve the challenge. In this work, we investigated the structure-stability relationship of As?S slag with adopting various As?S clusters as prototypes by density functional theory (DFT). Results showed that the configuration of S multimers-covering-(As2S3)n is the most stable structure amongst the candidates by the analysis of energies and bonding characteristics. The high stability is explained by orbital composition that the 4p-orbital (As) binding with 3p-orbital (S) decreases energy level of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Inspired from the calculations, an excess-S-based hydrothermal method was successfully proposed and achieved to promote the stabilization of As?S slag. Typically, the As concentration from the leaching test of stabilized As?S slag is only 0.8 mg/L, which is much lower than the value from other stabilized slag.","output":"Stabilization mechanism of arsenic-sulfide slag by density functional theory calculation of arsenic-sulfide clusters."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral tests including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are recommended to diagnose COVID-19 infection during the acute phase of infection. A test should have high sensitivity; however, the sensitivity of the PCR test is highly influenced by viral load, which changes over time. Because it is difficult to collect data before the onset of symptoms, the current literature on the sensitivity of the PCR test before symptom onset is limited. In this study, we used a viral dynamics model to track the probability of failing to detect a case of PCR testing over time, including the presymptomatic period. The model was parametrized by using longitudinal viral load data collected from 30 hospitalized patients. The probability of failing to detect a case decreased toward symptom onset, and the lowest probability was observed 2 days after symptom onset and increased afterwards. The probability on the day of symptom onset was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5 to 1.9) and that 2 days before symptom onset was 60.2% (95% CI: 57.1 to 63.2). Our study suggests that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR testing should be done carefully, especially when the test is performed before or way after symptom onset.

Cross-sectional survey data were drawn from a larger longitudinal study examining the relationship between PLWD aged 65+ and their CPs being conducted in a metropolitan city significantly affected by COVID-19. Interviews with were conducted remotely via videoconferencing and telephone. Data on sources and types of care provided for the PLWD, relationship quality and conflict, and caregiver stress were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics and tests of independence. Preliminary results from PLWD (n=8) and CPs (n=13) confirmed a reduction in social interaction with family members and friends. CPs reported they (n=5) or other family members (n=2) changed their schedules to provide care for the PLWD. CPs reported increased conflict with the PLWD regarding care provision, going out or welcoming visitors, and home management. In contrast, PLWD reported a lack of conflict among household members (n=6) and the perception of good changes (n=2) and increased quality time with CPs. Preliminary findings provide empirical evidence of the effects of pandemic public health policies on dyads enrolled in this study and reveal differences in perceived relational conflict between PLWD and their CPs.

In this study, an SVV strain isolated in China, named SVV LNSY01-2017 (MH064435), was used as the stock virus for the preparation of an SVV-inactivated vaccine. The SVV culture was directly inactivated using binary ethyleneimine (BEI) and -propiolactone (BPL). BPL showed a better effect as an SVV inactivator, according to the results of pH variation, inactivation kinetics, and the detection of VP1 content during inactivation. Then, SVV inactivated by BPL was subsequently emulsified using different adjuvants, including MONTANIDE(TM) ISA 201 VG (ISA 201) and MONTANIDE(TM) IMG 1313 VG N (IMS 1313). The immunoreactivity and protection efficacy of the inactivated vaccines were then evaluated in finishing pigs. SVV-BPL-1313 showed a better humoral response post-immunization and further challenge tests post-immunization showed that both the SVV-BPL-201 and SVV-BPL-1313 combinations could resist challenge from a virulent SVV strain.

METHODS: Sixteen colonizing GBS isolates obtained from recto-vaginal swabs of pregnant women and body surfaces of newborns were further analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, and whole genome sequence (WGS) methods were done for antibiotic susceptibility test, and molecular characterization of the isolates. RESULTS: All the GBS isolates analyzed were belonged to four capsular serotypes: II, 11/16(68.8%), V, 3/16(18.8%), Ia and VI each with 1/16(6.3%) and five sequence type (ST-2, ST-10, ST-14, ST-569 and ST-933). Sequence type-10 was the most predominant ST followed by ST-569. The five STs were grouped into the four clonal complexes (CC - 1, CC-10, CC-19, and CC-23). Different surface proteins and pili families such as ALP1, ALPHA, ALP23, PI-1 / PI-2A1, PI-1 / PI-2B, and Srr1 were detected from WGS data.

This has provided an opportunity to quantify the extent to which carbon-based transport and industrial activity affect air quality. However, quantification of these complex effects has proven to be difficult, depending on the stringency of restrictions, country-specific emission source profiles, long-term trends and meteorological effects on atmospheric chemistry, emission levels and in-flow from nearby countries. In this study, confounding factors were disentangled for a direct comparison of pandemic-related reductions in absolute pollutions levels, globally. The non-linear relationships between atmospheric processes and daily ground-level NO [Formula: see text] , PM(10), PM(2.5) and O [Formula: see text] measurements were captured in city- and pollutant-specific XGBoost models for over 700 cities, adjusting for weather, seasonality and trends. City-level modelling allowed adaptation to the distinct topography, urban morphology, climate and atmospheric conditions for each city, individually, as the weather variables that were most predictive varied across cities. Pollution forecasts for 2020 in absence of a pandemic were generated based on weather and formed an ensemble for country-level pollution reductions. Findings were robust to modelling assumptions and consistent with various published case studies. NO [Formula: see text] reduced most in China, Europe and India, following severe government restrictions as part of the initial lockdowns. Reductions were highly correlated with changes in mobility levels, especially trips to transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation venues. Further, NO [Formula: see text] did not fully revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2020. Ambient PM(2.5) pollution, which has severe adverse health consequences, reduced most in China and India. Since positive health effects could be offset to some extent by prolonged exposure to indoor pollution, alternative transport initiatives could prove to be an important pathway towards better health outcomes in these countries.

Psychoeducation was the most popular feature of both guided and unguided interventions. Attrition was highest (50%) in the unguided app-based intervention and lowest in the guided interventions. Many studies lacked active control groups and comparison was often made to a nondigital or waitlist control condition. SUMMARY Guided digital interventions continue to show promising results and can be used to enhance clinical care with minimal resources although more direct comparisons to existing treatments are necessary to understand their actual efficacy.

RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of clinical encounters that were in-person clinic visits decreased from 91% in 2019 to a low of 9% in April, 2020. Among pwCF seen after March 15 in both 2019 and 2020, the mean (95% CI) FEV1 % predicted was 1.3 (0.1, 2.4)% predicted higher in 2020 for children 6-<12 years of age, and 7.5 (7.1, 7.9)% predicted higher in 2020 among pwCF >=12 years of age eligible for the highly effective CFTR modulator, elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI). There was no difference in FEV1 % predicted for pwCF >=12 years of age who were not eligible for ETI. Similarly, the mean (95% CI) BMI percentile was 2.4 (2.0, 2.8) higher in 2020 for children 6-<12 years of age, and 5.2 (4.8, 5.7) higher in 2020 among children 12-<18 years of age eligible for ETI. Mean (95% CI) BMI (kg/m2) was 1.2 (1.2, 1.3) higher for pwCF >=18 years of age eligible for ETI, and 0.2 (0.1, 0.3) higher for pwCF >=18 years of age not eligible for ETI.

Nucleotide composition is the simplest way of characterizing genomes. Despite this simplicity, it has several implications. Indeed, it is the main factor that determines, among other features, dinucleotide frequencies, repeated short DNA sequences, and codon and amino acid usage. Which forces drive this strong variation is still a matter of controversy. For rather obvious reasons, most of the studies concerning this huge variation and its consequences, have been done in free-living organisms. However, no recent comprehensive study of all known viruses has been done (that is, concerning all available sequences). Viruses, by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth, are the causative agents of many diseases. An overview of these entities is important also because their genetic material is not always double-stranded DNA: indeed, certain viruses have as genetic material single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and/or retro-transcribing. Therefore, one may wonder if what we have learned about the evolution of GC content and its implications in prokaryotes and eukaryotes also applies to viruses. In this contribution, we attempt to describe compositional properties of  10,000 viral species: base composition (globally and according to Baltimore classification), correlations among non-coding regions and the three codon positions, and the relationship of the nucleotide frequencies and codon usage of viruses with the same feature of their hosts. This allowed us to determine how the base composition of phages strongly correlate with the value of their respective hosts, while eukaryotic viruses do not (with fungi and protists as exceptions). Finally, we discuss some of these results concerning codon usage: reinforcing previous results, we found that phages and hosts exhibit moderate to high correlations, while for eukaryotes and their viruses the correlations are weak or do not exist.","output":"Nucleotide Composition and Codon Usage Across Viruses and Their Respective Hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing recognition that health and well-being improvements have not been shared across populations in the Americas.

It finds significant variation in the substance and structure of how the health plans handle the issue. Nearly all countries explicitly include health equity as a clear goal, and most address the social determinants of health. Participatory processes documented in the development of these plans range from none to extensive and robust. Substantive equity-focused policies, such as those to improve physical accessibility of health care and increase affordable access to medicines, are included in many plans, though no country includes all aspects examined. Countries identify marginalized populations in their plans, though only a quarter specifically identify Afro-descendants and more than half do not address Indigenous people, including countries with large Indigenous populations. Four include attention to migrants. Despite health equity goals and data on baseline inequities, fewer than half of countries include time-bound targets on reducing absolute or relative health inequalities. Clear accountability mechanisms such as education, reporting, or rights-enforcement mechanisms in plans are rare.

This work proposes a new method of preparing Mg-Al-Fe Hydrotalcite-like compounds (MAF-HTCLs) by recycling DWTRs as the raw material to selectively adsorb anions in the waste water. In this study, MAF-HTCLs were prepared by the coprecipitation method with recycled DWTRs. The characterizations and adsorption of MAF-HTCLs were studied for the selective adsorption of P, Cr, F, and Br. The adsorption capacity was increasing as the value of pH decreased. For kinetic adsorption, the pseudo-second-order model fit better, and two isotherm models (the Langmuir and Freundlich models) described the isotherm results well. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacities of P, Cr, F, and Br were 55.2, 34.9, 16.84, and 13.9 mg/g, respectively. Based on the results of characterizations before and after adsorption, adsorption mechanisms of Cr, F, and Br were proposed, including physicochemical adsorption, surface complexation, and ion exchange, in which ion exchange was dominant. Finally, we determined that the selective adsorption mechanisms of P on MAF-HTCLs included strong ion exchange and surface chemical precipitation by analyzing the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.","output":"Selective adsorption of anions on hydrotalcite-like compounds derived from drinking water treatment residuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Letter, we report on experimental effective coherent multiple Stokes and anti-Stokes high-order components generation by Stokes pulse injection at the process of stimulated low-frequency Raman scattering.

Baseline calprotectin amount measured in peripheral blood at diagnosis correlates with disease severity. The optimal use of this biomarker along COVID-19 course remains to be delineated. Methods We focused on patients with a WHO-defined moderate COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in a medical ward. We collected plasma and serum from three independent cohorts (N = 626 patients) and measured calprotectin amount at admission. We performed longitudinal measures of calprotectin in 457 of these patients (1461 samples) and used a joint latent class mixture model in which classes were defined by age, body mass index and comorbidities to identify calprotectin trajectories predicting the risk of transfer into an intensive care unit or death. Findings After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index and comorbidities, the predictive value of baseline calprotectin in patients with moderate COVID19 could be refined by serial monitoring of the biomarker. We discriminated three calprotectin trajectories associated with low, moderate, and high risk of poor outcome, and we designed an algorithm available as online software (https://calpla.gustaveroussy.fr:8443/) to monitor the probability of a poor outcome in individual patients with moderate COVID-19. Interpretation These results emphasize the clinical interest of serial monitoring of calprotectin amount in the peripheral blood to anticipate the risk of poor outcomes in patients with moderate COVID-19 hospitalized in a standard care unit.

This study aimed to determine the association between initial ARI admission because of viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the risk of ARI readmission in children. METHODS Clinical information and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from children <2 years old at their initial ARI admission in Nha Trang, Vietnam, from January 2007 to April 2012. The incidence of ARI readmission during the follow-up period (initial admission to 5 years of age) was compared between children with and without 1 of 13 respiratory viruses (influenza virus A, influenza virus B, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza virus-1, parainfluenza virus-2, parainfluenza virus-3 and parainfluenza virus-4, HRV, human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, HAdV and human bocavirus) at initial admission. RESULTS A total of 1941 children were enrolled in the study. Viruses were detected in 1254 (64.6%) children at enrollment; HRV, RSV, HAdV and hMPV were detected in 499 (25.7%), 439 (22.6%), 156 (8.0%) and 47 (2.4%) children, respectively. During the follow-up period (4572.7 person-years), 277 children were readmitted with ARI. Virus-related ARI initial admission was associated with an increased risk of ARI readmission for children who were initially admitted before 6 months of age (adjusted rate ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.5). HAdV (4.6; 1.8-11.9), hMPV (20.4; 6.2-66.9) and HRV (1.6; 1.0-2.4) were independently associated with the outcome. These associations were not observed for children whose initial admission occurred after 6 months of age.

China has experienced an astonishing expansion of its urban scale in the past 40 years, and nearly 783 million of the nation's people now live in cities. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta have been prioritized to become world-class clusters by 2020. The health effects of air pollution in these three urban agglomerations are becoming increasingly formidable. Given these conditions, using the daily mean PM2.5 concentration in 40 cities from January 2014 to December 2016, this research explored the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations in these three urban agglomerations. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are 35.39 g/m3, 53.72 g/m3 and 78.54 g/m3, respectively. Compared with the other two urban agglomerations, abundant rainfall causes the Pearl River Delta to have the lowest PM2.5 level. Furthermore, a general regression neural network (GRNN) method is developed to predict the PM2.5 concentration in these clusters on the second day, with inputs including the average, maximum and minimum temperature; average, maximum and minimum atmosphere; total rainfall; average humidity; average and maximum wind speed; and the PM2.5 concentration measured 1 day ahead. The results indicate that the GRNN method can precisely predict the concentration level in these clusters, and it is especially useful for the Pearl River Delta, as the underlying influence mechanism is more specified in this cluster than in the others. Importantly, this 1-day-ahead forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations can raise awareness among the public to improve their precautionary behaviours and help urban planners to provide corresponding support.","output":"Spatio-temporal variation and daily prediction of PM2.5 concentration in world-class urban agglomerations of China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protecting vulnerable populations from the COVID-19 pandemic is a strategic imperative, especially when considering the potential vulnerability it has on a wide range of marginalized communities.

On the other hand, acute care hospitals postponed elective interventions for the benefit of Corona patients and rehab patients denied treatment due to the fear of becoming infected. As a consequence a loss in revenue turns out while additional costs for infection protection management arose simultaneously. Methodology Aim of the study was to specify the economic risks of rehab facilities caused by the pandemic as well as the increasing medical requirements. Based on a structured questionnaire 97 rehab providers were polled referring to e. g. the ?medical treatment situation\\", the ?revenue development\\", the ?cost pressure\\" and the ?effects of supporting activities of the government\\". Results The revenue of rehab clinics collapsed intermittently up to 70 % compared to the previous year. Simultaneously, additional costs of 349  per patient and employee per treatment cycle (21 days) accumulated due to decreed infection prevention arrangements. This unplanned cost burden corresponds roughly to 13 % of the revenue per case. The decline of rehab treatments under the pandemic will lead on to an exaggerated demand of medically necessary treatments in future. This congestion of non-performed rehab treatments is prognosed to exceed 20 % to 25 % of the rehab treatments performed in 2019. In 29 % of the facilities the shortage of personal protective equipment was associated with dysfunctional workflows and endangerment of patients suffering an infection. 71 % of the rehab facilities stated not to have benefitted from the procurement initiative of the German Ministry of Health. Discussion The Corona pandemic has reinforced the economic vulnerability of many rehab providers. This, due to additional costs for infection prevention activities, revenue losses owing to reduced occupancy and because of an investment bottleneck accumulated over years. Furthermore, the reimbursement system is complained not to cover the total costs of treatment in an economically sufficient way. Necessary investments in infection protection are a cost-driver but also lead to a factual impairment of treatment capacity. As a consequence, a piling up of medically essential rehab treatment is assumed to happen and will effect an increasing disease burden in the health system. Core Message The risk of insolvency has enhanced for rehab facilities due to the pandemic. Simultaneously, medical requirements have arisen and cost pressure has become more intensive. Because rehabilitation to play a pivotal role in public services the reimbursement system of the rehab sector is urged to be changed. One strong opinion requires to finance the costs of keeping rehab facilities. Indeed, this financing approach should be based on an assessment of the rehab demand. Furthermore, the operating costs are advised to be paid depended on medical quality, physical condition of the patient and the complexity of treatment. Zusammenfassung: Hintergrund Bereits in den ersten 6 Monaten der Pandemie erlitten die Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen massive Erl?seinbu?en. Dies einerseits durch die Aussetzung von Heilverfahren und Nachsorgeangeboten sowie die Verpflichtung, im Bedarfsfall verlegbare Patienten aus Akutkrankenh?usern zu bernehmen;andererseits fhrte die Verschiebung elektiver Eingriffe zugunsten der priorit?ren Behandlung von Covid-19-Patienten in den Akuth?usern sowie die Angst von Reha-Patienten vor einer Infektion zu einem Nachfragerckgang. Demgegenber entstanden erhebliche Zusatzkosten durch die Organisation infektionssicherer Arbeitsabl?ufe sowie die Beschaffung von Produkten der pers?nlichen Schutzausrstung (PSA) auf einem berhitzten freien Markt. Das Insolvenzrisiko fr die Reha-Einrichtungen erh?hte sich. Methoden Ziel der Studie war es, die ?konomischen und ablauforganisatorischen Konsequenzen sowie die Infektionsrisiken fr Personal und Patienten einer Unterversorgung mit PSA-Produkten im Bereich der Rehabilitation zu ermitteln sowie die Effektivit?t staatlicher Eingriffe bei der Beschaffung von PSA-Produkten zu reflektieren. Durchgefhrt wurde im Zeitraum 25. bis 28. Woche 2020 eine Online-Befragung unter 79 Einrichtungen mittels strukturiertem Fragebogen, u. a. spezifiziert nach den Erhebungsbereichen ?Versorgungssituation bei PSA-Produkten\\", ?Umgang mit PSA-Versorgungsengp?ssen\\", ?Ertragssituation\\", ?Zusatzkosten\\" und ?Wirksamkeit staatlicher Hilfsma?nahmen\\". In weiteren 18 Einrichtungen wurden Einzelinterviews zur Praxis des Pandemie-Managements vor Ort gefhrt. Die Erhebung wurde auf orthop?dische, kardiologische und neurologische Einrichtungen konzentriert. Ergebnisse Der Umsatz der Einrichtungen ging um zeitweise bis zu 70 % gegenber dem Vorjahr zurck, gleichzeitig erh?hten sich die Kosten fr Infektionsprophylaxe um durchschnittlich 349  pro Patient und Mitarbeiter pro Behandlungszyklus (21 Tage), was etwa 13 % des Fall-Erl?ses bedeutete. Durch den Rckgang bei Patientenbehandlungen w?hrend der Pandemie baute sich ein Behandlungsstau auf, der zwischen 20 und 25 % der Reha-Leistungen des Jahres 2019 entspricht und die Krankheitslast im Gesundheitssystem zuknftig erh?hen wird. Der Mangel an Schutzausrstung fhrte in 29 % der Einrichtungen zu erschwerten Arbeitsabl?ufen mit Infektionsgef?hrdung fr Patienten und Mitarbeitende. Von der Beschaffungsinitiative des Bundesministeriums fr Gesundheit fhlten sich 71 % der Einrichtungen nicht versorgt. Diskussion Die Corona-Pandemie hat die Anf?lligkeit zahlreicher Reha-Einrichtungen fr eine wirtschaftliche Schieflage verst?rkt. Ursache dafr sind pandemiebedingte Zusatzkosten, Erl?sausf?lle aufgrund von Belegungsrckg?ngen und ein Investitionsstau in zahlreichen Einrichtungen. Notwendige Ma?nahmen des Infektionsschutzes erh?hen nicht nur die Kostenbelastung, sondern vermindern faktisch die verfgbare Behandlungskapazit?t. Als Konsequenz ist ein Behandlungsstau zu erwarten, der mit erh?hter Krankheitslast im Gesundheitssystem verbunden sein wird. Kernbotschaft Das Insolvenzrisiko hat sich fr Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen durch die Corona-Krise erh?ht, gleichzeitig sind die Anforderungen an medizinische Qualit?t und Infektionsschutz ebenso wie die Vorhalte- und Behandlungskosten gestiegen. Eine Reform der Refinanzierung von Reha-Leistungen ist notwendig: Dies betrifft die Finanzierung von Vorhaltekosten von Reha-Einrichtungen als Teil der Daseinsvorsorge. Hier ist allerdings eine versorgungsstrukturelle und institutionenorientierte Bedarfsermittlung vorzuschalten, um Mitnahmeeffekten vorzubeugen. Weiterhin ist die Vergtung der Betriebskosten qualit?ts- und aufwandorientiert am Krankheitsbild und am Patientenzustand vorzunehmen.","output":"Rehabilitations- und Vorsorgeeinrichtungen in der Corona-Krise: Situation und postpandemische Perspektive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Male sex is related to increased COVID-19 severity and fatality although confirmed infections are similarly distributed between men and women. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the impact of sex hormones on disease progression and immune activation in men with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied for effects of sex hormones on disease severity and immune activation in 377 patients (230 men, 147 women) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections hospitalized at the Innsbruck University Hospital between February and December 2020. RESULTS: Men had more severe COVID-19 with concomitant higher immune system activation upon hospital admission when compared to women. Men with a severe course of infection had lower serum total testosterone (tT) levels whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E(2)) levels were within the normal range. tT deficiency was associated with elevated CRP (rs = - 0.567, p < 0.001), IL-6 levels (rs = - 0.563, p < 0.001), lower cholesterol levels (rs = 0.407, p < 0.001) and an increased morbidity and mortality. Men with tT levels < 100 ng/dL had a more than eighteen-fold higher in-hospital mortality risk (OR 18.243 [95%CI 2.301 C 144.639], p = 0.006) compared to men with tT levels > 230 ng/dL. Moreover, while morbidity and mortality showed a positive correlation with E(2) levels at admission, we detected a negative correlation with the tT/E(2) ratio upon hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized men with COVID-19 present with rather low testosterone levels linked to more advanced immune activation, severe clinical manifestations translating into an increased risk for ICU admission or death. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive but may include infection driven hypogonadism as well as inflammation mediated cholesterol reduction causing gonadotropin suppression and impaired androgen formation. Finally, in elderly late onset hypogonadism might also contribute to lower testosterone levels.","output":"Testosterone Deficiency Is a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water-soluble amphiphilic polymers are vital chemicals in the oil and gas industry to retard crystal growth of hydrocarbon hydrate via surface adsorption and suppress nucleation of a pristine hydrate nucleus, thereby preventing formation of hydrate blockages in flow lines during oil and natural gas production. Apart from a few theoretical modeling studies, an experimental method to study the polymer/water interface in the crystal growth is critically needed. Here, water motions in the hydration shells of an exemplary kinetic inhibitor, poly(N-vinylcaprolactam), during hydrate formation from the tetrahydrofuran/water system are revealed via nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry. Unequivocal experiments show that the pivotal interfacial water in the tightly bound state gradually freezes at rates depending on the polymer molecular weight (MW). This is supported by nonfreezable water analysis, which is correlated to the inhibition time. The polymers tune the kinetics of the hydration process via interaction with and perturbation of the water molecules. The free water component in the polymer solution crystallizes at a very slow rate when in partially restricted mobility, whereas the bound water component increases in the reaction, with the polymer/water interface serving as the reaction sites. The appropriate MW (including average MW and polydispersity values) of the inhibitive polymers can give rise to maximal retardation of the hydrate crystal growth. This work will help control other multiphase crystallization kinetic processes through the design of inhibitors or promoters functioning in the interface.","output":"Unraveling Amphiphilic Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)/Water Interface by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry: Control of Clathrate Hydrate Formation Kinetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice of clinical medicine needs to be a very flexible discipline which can adapt promptly to continuously changing surrounding events.

We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others. At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance.

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-centered approach, we explored the experiences and needs of people living with dementia and their care partners during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of an ongoing evaluation of dementia support services in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: A survey instrument was developed around the priorities identified in the context of the COVID-19 and Dementia Task Force convened by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were able to access information that was helpful for maintaining their own health and managing a period of social distancing. Care partners reported a number of serious concerns, including the inability to visit the person that they care for in long-term or palliative care. Participants also reported that the pandemic increased their levels of stress overall and that they felt lonelier and more isolated than they did before the pandemic. The use of technology was reported as a way to connect socially with their loved ones, with the majority of participants connecting with others at least twice per week.

Most studies focused on individual predictors for mortality. Although some prognostic factors were consistently identified across the different studies such as older age or cardiovascular comorbidities, other discrepancies reflect geographical location of the studies, characteristics of study population, admission in wards and/or intensive care units, and variables incorporated in the statistical model. We aimed to a priori identify specific patient profiles, then assessing their association with the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms admitted specifically in hospital wards. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single center study from February, 27, 2020 to April, 27, 2020. A non-supervised cluster analysis was first used to detect patient profiles based on characteristics at admission of 220 consecutive patients admitted at our institution. Then, we assessed its prognostic value, using Cox regression analyses to predict survival. RESULTS: Three clusters were identified, with 47 patients in cluster 1, 87 in cluster 2, and 86 in cluster 3, and whose presentation differed. Cluster 1 mostly included sexagenarian patients with active malignancy who were admitted early after COVID-19 onset. Cluster 2 included the oldest, overweight patients with high blood pressure and renal insufficiency, while cluster 3 included the youngest patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed admission. These subgroups of patients were associated with different outcomes, with 60 days survival of 74.3% (cluster1), 50.6% (cluster2) and 96.5% (cluster3) (figure 1). This was confirmed by the multivariable Cox analyses that exhibited the prognostic value of those patterns. CONCLUSION: The cluster approach seems appropriate and pragmatic to early identify patient profiles that could help physicians to segregate patients according to their prognosis.

In addition, this study investigates how impulsivity affects alcohol use and gambling. In total, 794 Swedish students answered an online survey. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics to determine prevalence, and multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the contribution of impulsivity, age, and sex to alcohol use and gambling. Compared to the Swedish national prevalence, the prevalence was higher for excessive alcohol use, but the prevalence of gambling was at the same level or lower. High levels of impulsivity and male sex increased the risk of excessive alcohol use, while older age lowered the risk of excessive alcohol use and gambling. The results indicate that primarily young men could benefit from primary prevention in a university setting.

The use of a polygenic risk score (PRS) could improve CAD risk assessment, but predictive accuracy according to age and sex is not well established. Methods: A PRSCAD including the weighted effects of >1.14 million SNPs associated with CAD was calculated in UK Biobank (n=408,422), using LDPred. Cox regressions were performed, stratified by age quartiles and sex, for incident MI and mortality, with a median follow-up of 11.0 years. Improvement in risk prediction of MI was assessed by comparing PRSCAD to the pooled cohort equation with categorical net reclassification index using a 2% threshold (NRI0.02) and continuous NRI (NRI>0). Results: From 7,746 incident MI cases and 393,725 controls, hazard ratio (HR) for MI reached 1.53 (95% CI [1.49-1.56], p=2.69e-296) per standard deviation (SD) increase of PRSCAD. PRSCAD was significantly associated with MI in both sexes, with a stronger association in men (interaction p=0.002), particularly in those aged between 40-51 years (HR=2.00, 95% CI [1.86-2.16], p=1.93e-72). This group showed the highest reclassification improvement, mainly driven by the up-classification of cases (NRI0.02=0.199, 95% CI [0.157-0.248] and NRI>0=0.602, 95% CI [0.525-0.683]).

Conclusion: Our PRSCAD predicts MI incidence and all-cause mortality, especially in men aged between 40-51 years.

We followed our formerly described protocol in use since 2016 offering the option of SDD to all robotic urologic surgery patients, regardless of procedure type or patient-specific factors. RESULTS: During COVID-19 restrictions (COV), 89 robotic surgeries were performed and compared with 1667 of the same procedures performed previously (pre-COV) and 42 during the following month (post-COV). Among COV patients 98% (87/89 patients) opted for same-day discharge after surgery versus 52% in the historical pre-COV group (P < .00001). Post-COV, the higher rate of SDD was maintained at 98% (41/42 patients). There were no differences in 30-day complications or readmissions between SDD and overnight patients with only 2 COV (2%) and no post-COV 30-day readmissions. CONCLUSION: SDD after robotic surgery was safely applied during the COVID-19 crisis without increasing complications or readmissions. SDD may allow continuation of robotic surgery despite limited hospital beds and when minimizing hospital stay is important to protect postoperative patients from infection. Our experience suggests that patient attitude is a major factor in SDD after robotic surgery since the proportion of patients opting for SDD was much higher during COV and continued post-COV.

This has arisen from the varying personal behaviour and tactical use of lockdown strategies within each country. We report the use of microsimulation of a simulated community in Australia, using a discrete infection model within a community of residences, places of work and recreation to demonstrate the applicability of this method to both the current pandemic and to infection more generally. Simulations without any societal intervention on infection spread provided base simulations that could be compared with social and societal controls in the future and which were compared with the initial doubling times of country outbreaks across the world. Different population sizes were represented in some simulations and in other simulations the effects of either social distancing or the use of facial masks as personal behaviours was investigated within the community. Good agreement is found between the initial doubling times for several countries and the simulations that suggests that modelling infection as a collection of individual infections provides an alternative to current epidemiological models. The variation of the basic reproductive number, R0, with time and population size, suggests that one of the fundamentals assumptions in SIR type models is wrong, but varies according to the properties of the population being modelled. Investigation of the infection spread shows that the number of super-spreaders varies with the size of the population and occurs through contacts in clubs, supermarkets, schools and theatres where the source of infection is an employee and where there are high numbers of contacts. The simulations of individual control show that the benefits of social distancing or wearing masks is only fully realised where there is considerable compliance within society to these measures.","output":"Microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To explore metal implants' thermal effect on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and ascertain distance-thermal relationship between the metal implants and radiofrequency (RF) electrode.

A longstanding approach to understanding such processes has been the social amplification of risk framework. But this implies that some true level of risk becomes distorted in social actors perceptions. Many risk events are characterised by such uncertainties, disagreements and changes in scientific knowledge that it becomes unreasonable to speak of a true level of risk. The most we can often say in such cases is that different groups believe each other to be either amplifying or attenuating a risk. This inherent subjectivity raises the question as to whether risk managers can expect any particular kinds of outcome to emerge. This question is the basis for a case study of zoonotic disease outbreaks using systems dynamics as a modelling medium. The model shows that processes suggested in the social amplification of risk framework produce polarised risk responses among different actors, but that the subjectivity magnifies this polarisation considerably. As this subjectivity takes more complex forms it leaves problematic residues at the end of a disease outbreak, such as an indefinite drop in economic activity and an indefinite increase in anxiety.","output":"Managing the social amplification of risk: a simulation of interacting actors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photosystem II (PS II) captures solar energy and directs charge separation (CS) across the thylakoid membrane during photosynthesis. The highly oxidizing, charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains and the amino acid residues <6 ? from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified exciton-charge transfer states (ChlD1 +PheD1 -)* and (PD2 +PD1 -)*.

Regarding the causative foods of anisakiasis, cases by ingestion of mackerel (Scomber spp.) have been the most common in Japan, and cases caused by eating marinated mackerel accounted for 32.8% of the total in Tokyo from 2011 to 2017. However, the number of reports of food poisoning caused by skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) was highest in May 2018 in Japan. A parasitological surveys of Anisakis third-stage larvae in skipjack tuna in Japanese waters were conducted in 2018 and 2019, and it was confirmed that more A. simplex infections of skipjack tuna may have occurred in 2018 than usual due to the meandering flow of the Black Current. Moreover, a portion of A. simplex larvae migrated from visceral organs to the ventral muscle in live skipjack tuna before capture, suggesting that an extensive cold chain after capture cannot prevent anisakiasis. In fish species that were reported to be high frequency of causative food of anisakiasis, it is necessary to freeze or at least remove the ventral muscle.","output":"Current Status of Anisakiasis and Anisakis Larvae in Tokyo, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In an effort to improve the efficiency of computer algorithms applied to screening for COVID-19 testing, we used natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods with unstructured patient data collected through telehealth visits. METHODS: After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an AUC of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling.

To date, few studies have examined the association between pre-COVID-19 experiences of food insecurity and COVID-19 infection rates through a race/ethnicity lens. Objective: To examine the associations of race/ethnicity and past experiences of food insecurity with COVID-19 infection rates and the interactions of race/ethnicity and food insecurity, while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, risk exposure, and geographic confounders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study examined the associations of race/ethnicity and food insecurity with cumulative COVID-19 infection rates in 3133 US counties, as of July 21 and December 14, 2020. Data were analyzed from November 2020 through March 2021. Exposures: Racial/ethnic minority groups who experienced food insecurity. Main Outcomes and Measures: The dependent variable was COVID-19 infections per 1000 residents. The independent variables of interest were race/ethnicity, food insecurity, and their interactions. Results: Among 3133 US counties, the mean (SD) racial/ethnic composition was 9.0% (14.3%) Black residents, 9.6% (13.8%) Hispanic residents, 2.3% (7.3%) American Indian or Alaska Native residents, 1.7% (3.2%) Asian American or Pacific Islander residents, and 76.1% (20.1%) White residents. The mean (SD) proportion of women was 49.9% (2.3%), and the mean (SD) proportion of individuals aged 65 years or older was 19.3% (4.7%). In these counties, large Black and Hispanic populations were associated with increased COVID-19 infection rates in July 2020. An increase of 1 SD in the percentage of Black and Hispanic residents in a county was associated with an increase in infection rates per 1000 residents of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.04 to 3.94; P < .001) and 2.91 (95% CI, 0.39 to 5.43; P = .02), respectively. By December, a large Black population was no longer associated with increased COVID-19 infection rates. However, a 1-SD increase in the percentage of Black residents in counties with high prevalence of food insecurity was associated with an increase in infections per 1000 residents of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.47; P = .003). Similarly, a 1-SD increase in the percentage of American Indian or Alaska Native residents in counties with high levels of food insecurity was associated with an increase in COVID-19 infections per 1000 residents of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.06 to 1.08; P = .03). By contrast, a 1-SD increase in Hispanic populations in a county remained independently associated with a 5.64 (95% CI, 3.54 to 7.75; P < .001) increase in infection rates per 1000 residents in December 2020 vs 2.91 in July 2020. Furthermore, while a 1-SD increase in the proportion of Asian American or Pacific Islander residents was associated with a decrease in infection rates per 1000 residents of -1.39 (95% CI, -2.29 to 0.49; P = .003), the interaction with food insecurity revealed a similar association (interaction coefficient, -1.48; 95% CI, -2.26 to -0.70; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study sheds light on the association of race/ethnicity and past experiences of food insecurity with COVID-19 infection rates in the United States.

Case-based teaching formats under expert supervision can be used as a substitute for practical bedside teaching, where the focus is on teaching clinical reasoning skills. Methods: For medical students of LMU and TU Munich, the interactive, case-based, and supervised teaching format of Clinical Case Discussion (CCD) was digitised and implemented as dCCD in their respective curricula. Case discussions were realised as videoconferences, led by a student moderator, and took place under the supervision of a board-certified clinician. To prevent passive participation, additional cognitive activations were implemented. Acceptance, usability, and subjective learning outcomes were assessed in dCCDs by means of a special evaluation concept. Results: With regard to acceptance, students were of the opinion that they had learned effectively by participating in dCCDs (M=4.31; SD=1.37). The majority of students also stated that they would recommend the course to others (M=4.23; SD=1.62).

The surface characterization results of SEM, FTIR, and EDX demonstrated the successful synthesis of PDP coating. Contact angle analysis revealed that PDP coating endowed the polyester textile with the hydrophobicity against the attachment of different aqueous foulants such as blood, coffee, and milk, as well as the oleophobicity against paraffin oil. Zeta potential analysis demonstrated that the PDP coating enabled a transformation of negative charge to positive charge on the surface of polyester textile. The PDP coating exhibited excellent contact-killing activity against both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the killing efficiency of approximate 99.9%. In addition, the antiviral capacity of PDP was determined by a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression-based method using lentivirus-EGFP as a virus model.

Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS: The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS: From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms.

Participants who had lower levels of education, were unemployed or had no income showed greater psychological trauma symptoms, whereas female, older and more educated participants showed greater compliance with preventative measures. Participants who spent more time watching news reports of COVID-19 had greater psychological trauma, but also greater compliance. Participants who were male, older, had lower education levels or were married showed greater acceptance of vaccination and participation in voluntary testing. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic factors affected both psychological trauma and engagement in health-protective measures at one year after the onset of the pandemic.

The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 20 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 740,000 died. In view of the situation, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The present work evaluated, through molecular docking assays, the interactions of 4-acetamidechalcones with enzymatic and structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 and with the host's ACE2, which is recognized by the virus, facilitating its entry into cells. Therefore, it was observed that, regarding the interactions of chalcones with Main protease (Mpro), the chalcone N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-flurophenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPF) has the potential for coupling in the same region as the natural inhibitor FJC through strong hydrogen bonding. The formation of two strong hydrogen bonds between N-(4[(2E)-3-(phenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAB) and the NSP16-NSP10 heterodimer methyltransferase was also noted. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPM) and N-(4-[(2E)-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPE) chalcones showed at least one strong intensity interaction of the SPIKE protein. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-dimetilaminophenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPA) chalcone had a better affinity with ACE2, with strong hydrogen interactions. Together, our results suggest that 4-acetamidechalcones inhibit the interaction of the virus with host cells through binding to ACE2 or SPIKE protein, probably generating a steric impediment. In addition, chalcones have an affinity for important enzymes in post-translational processes, interfering with viral replication.","output":"In silico study of the potential interactions of 4-acetamidechalcones with protein targets in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NCAP) functions in viral RNA genome packaging, virion assembly, RNA synthesis and translation, and regulation of host immune response.

To address this fundamental question, we employed electrophoresis mobility shift and competition assays to compare NCAP binding to RNAs that are of SARS-CoV-2 vs. non-SARS-CoV-2, long vs. short, and structured vs. unstructured. We found that although NCAP can bind all RNAs tested, it primarily binds structured RNAs, and their association suppresses strong interaction with single-stranded RNAs. NCAP prefers long RNAs, especially those containing multiple structures separated by single-stranded linkers that presumably offer conformational flexibility. Additionally, all three major regions of NCAP bind RNA, including the low complexity domain and dimerization domain that promote formation of NCAP oligomers, amyloid fibrils and liquid-liquid phase separation. Combining these observations, we propose that NCAP-NCAP interactions that mediate higher-order structures during packaging also drive recognition of the genomic RNA and call this mechanism recognition-by-packaging. This study provides a biochemical basis for understanding the complex NCAP-RNA interactions in the viral life cycle and a broad range of similar biological processes.

Drawing on a survey of 205 small-scale commercial broiler farms (SCBFs) in Egypt, this study identifies the primary pathways through which the pandemic has affected these farms and investigates the determinants of their perception of COVID-19 effects. The empirical results revealed that the pandemic affected SCBFs heterogeneously based on their management and production systems and resource endowment. In particular, individually owned farms and those with membership of poultry producer organizations and larger total asset values perceived significantly fewer effects. In addition, SCBFs operating in both local and provincial markets were less likely to perceive negative effects from the pandemic. Despite that the adoption of strict containment measures was essential for protecting public health, our results indicate that policy responses to COVID-19 must consider the likely effects on small businesses such as SCBFs since disruptions to such socioeconomically important supply chains will intensify human suffering from the pandemic. These findings of our study provide important implications for enhancing the preparedness and resilience of small-scale broiler production systems in developing countries to future pandemics and natural hazards. ABSTRACT: As in many other countries, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with subsequent government containment measures, posed significant challenges to small-scale broiler production systems in Egypt. Based on a survey of 205 specialist small-scale commercial broiler farms (SCBFs) consisting of both farm-based and household-based production systems, this study identifies the primary pathways through which COVID-19 has affected SCBFs and investigates the determinants of farm perception of these effects. A polychoric principal component analysis sorted the effects of the pandemic on the SCBFs surveyed into five categories, namely, input availability, production and operational costs, labor and human resources, consumer demand and sales, and farm finances. Next, five ordered logit models were constructed to examine the determinants of the SCBFs perception of each category of these effects. Generally, the empirical results revealed that COVID-19 affected SCBFs heterogeneously based on their management and production systems and resource endowment. Female-led and household-based SCBFs perceived significantly greater COVID-19 effects. In contrast, individually owned farms and those with membership of poultry producer organizations and larger total asset values perceived fewer effects. In addition, SCBFs operating in both local and provincial markets were less likely to perceive negative effects from the pandemic on their broiler farming activities. Although the adoption of strict and immediate containment measures was essential for controlling the virus and protecting public health, our results indicate that policy responses to COVID-19 must consider the likely effects on small businesses such as SCBFs since disruptions to such socioeconomically important supply chains will intensify human suffering from the pandemic. Overall, our findings provide important implications for the formulation of effective strategies for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on small-scale broiler production systems in Egypt and enhancing their preparedness and resilience to future pandemics, natural hazard risks, and market shocks.","output":"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 Impacts on Small-Scale Commercial Broiler Production Systems in Egypt: Implications for Mitigation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhinovirus is the major cause of common cold and frequently associates with acute wheezing, otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia.

METHODS We used data from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) trial and assessed severity of WML on baseline non-contrast CT imaging (NCCT; n = 473) according to the Van Swieten Scale. Post-stroke functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We investigated the association of WML with functional outcome using ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and other relevant cardiovascular and prognostic risk factors. In addition, an interaction term between treatment allocation and WML severity was used to assess treatment effect modification by WML. RESULTS We found an independent negative association between more severe WML and functional outcome (acOR 0.77 [95% CI 0.66-0.90]). Patients with absent to moderate WML had similar benefit of EVT on functional outcome (acOR 1.93 [95% CI 1.31-2.84]) as patients with severe WML (acOR 1.95 [95% CI 0.90-4.20]). No treatment effect modification of WML was found (p for interaction = 0.85).

Social, demographic and behavioural factors were compared in people with a positive test (cases) and a sample of negatives (controls). Population attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated for factors with significantly increased odds following multivariate analysis. Results A total of 199 cases and 2,621 controls were recruited by SMS (response rates: 27.1% and 37.6% respectively). Following adjustment, cases were more likely to work in the hospitality sector (aOR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.43-8.03), social care (aOR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.22-5.67) or healthcare (aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.29-4.13), live with someone self-isolating due to contact with a case (aOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 2.03-4.62), visit a pub (aOR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.11-7.37), and smoke or vape (aOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.32). In this community, and at this point in the epidemic, reducing transmission from a household contact who is self-isolating would have the biggest public health impact (PAF: 0.2). Conclusion Infection prevention and control should be strengthened to help reduce household transmission. As restrictions on social mixing are relaxed, hospitality venues will become of greater public health importance, and those working in this sector should be adequately protected.

In this regard, the present contribution aims to present a critical and comprehensive review of the current technology for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy training, including both commercial products and platforms at a research stage. Not limited to it, the recent revolution played by the technological advancements in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, and computational tools on simulation-based learning is documented and discussed. Finally, considerations on the future trend of this application field are drawn, highlighting the impact of the most recent pandemic and the current demographic trends. ABSTRACT: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is the gold standard in the detection and treatment of early and advanced GI cancers. However, conventional endoscopic techniques are technically demanding and require visual-spatial skills and significant hands-on experience. GI endoscopy simulators represent a valid solution to allow doctors to practice in a pre-clinical scenario. From the first endoscopy mannequin, developed in 1969, several simulation platforms have been developed, ranging from purely mechanical systems to more complex mechatronic devices and animal-based models. Considering the recent advancement of technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, augmented reality, robotics), simulation platforms can now reach high levels of realism, representing a valid and smart alternative to standard trainee/mentor learning programs. This is particularly true nowadays, when the current demographic trend and the most recent pandemic demand, more than ever, the ability to cope with many patients. This review offers a broad view of the technology available for GI endoscopy training, including platforms currently in the market and the relevant advancements in this research and application field.

The most common types of cancers were breast (19.8%), prostate (10.9%), and colorectal cancer (10.8%). 65% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. At least one Covid-19 directed therapy was given in 73% of the patients.. Hospitalization rate of the patients was 56.6% and intensive care unit admission rate was 11.4%. 77 (5.1%) patients died within 30 days of diagnosis. The first multivariate model which included only the demographic and clinical characteristics showed older age, male gender, and presence of diabetes and receipt of cytotoxic therapy to be associated with increased 30-day mortality, while breast and prostate cancer diagnoses were associated with lower 30-day mortality. In the second set, we further included laboratory parameters. The presence of leukocytosis (OR 6.7, 95 % CI 3.3-13.7, p<0,001), lymphocytopenia (OR 3,1, 95 % CI 1,6-6,1, p=0,001) and thrombocytopenia (OR 3,4 95% CI 1,5-8,1, p=0,005) were found to be associated with increased 30-day mortality. Relatively lower mortality compared with Western countries and China mainly results from differences in baseline risk factors but may also implicate the importance of intensive supportive care.

One reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding preventive measures against COVID-19 and the inability of the psychiatric patients to discern misinformation from facts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional. We applied one questionnaire that evaluated knowledge of prevention measures and information about COVID-19 (comprised of two sections, each with five questions). The first section evaluated knowledge regarding the official WHO prevention measures against COVID-19, and the second consisted of false information about COVID-19 which examined the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19. These questionnaires were applied face-to-face to psychiatric male inpatients from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Bucharest diagnosed with SMI or severe alcohol disorder (SAUD) and to male controls from the community, matched by age and education. Mean scores of patients and controls were compared using MannCWhitney test. RESULTS: There were 115 male psychiatric patients in total (65 SMI and 50 SAUD) and 57 controls included after the matching procedure. We found statistically significant lower (P<0.05) scores for psychiatric patients compared to controls regarding the prevention and general knowledge of COVID-19 (P<0.001), the WHO information about prevention measures (P=0.041), and the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19 (P<0.001). The fact that psychiatric patients have less knowledge about prevention measures against COVID-19 and a reduced capacity to discern misinformation suggests that we need to identify new methods to convey correct information to these patients and also to better equip them to handle misinformation regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with SMI and SAUD are less informed regarding COVID-19 infection and preventive measures compared to controls, while being prone to believing false information about COVID-19 as well.","output":"Knowledge of Prevention Measures and Information About Coronavirus in Romanian Male Patients with Severe Mental Illness and Severe Alcohol Use Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) survivors are coping with late treatment sequelae. Testosterone deficiency may contribute to earlier onset of metabolic syndrome. The study aimed to assess connections between serum testosterone concentrations and metabolic disorders as well as body composition in TGCT survivors. 336 TGCT patients with over two years of complete post-treatment remission were divided into three groups: definite testosterone deficiency (< 8 nmol/L), 'grey zone' (8-12 nmol/L) and normal testosterone (> 12 nmol/L; control group) to assess differences in metabolism. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The multivariate analysis assessed the risk of metabolic disorders and changes in body composition with regard to testosterone concentrations adjusted for age, smoking history, clinical stage, type of treatment and follow-up period. 14% of patients presented with definite testosterone deficiency; 46% were in the 'grey zone'. On multivariate analysis, low testosterone levels were related to hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory processes, procoagulant state and obesity. The odds ratio (OR) for the onset of metabolic syndrome was 2.87 (95% CI 1.74-4.73, p < 0.001) for the 'grey zone' patients and 7.92 (95% CI 3.76-16.70, p < 0.001) for those with definite testosterone deficiency.

METHOD: We conducted an ecological study of the association between the cumulative deaths attributed to Covid-19 epidemic in the 20 Italian regions and nine determinants of population health derived from a systematic review of the literature. We used a multiple least square regression to predict the cross-regional variation in mortality observed from the onset of the epidemic to 23 September 2020. RESULTS: Four independent variables best explained the cross-regional differences in the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19: the force of infection, population density, number of elderly living in assisted facilities and the standard rate of diabetes. The semi-partial correlation coefficients suggest that the force of infection and the number of elderly residents in nursing homes were the dominant predictors of the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. Statistical controls and validation confirmed the generalizability of the predictive model.

The top three primary concerns were related to health and well-being of family and loved ones. Levels of negative emotion were high. Modelling of predictors of negative emotions established several risk factors related to demographic variables, personal vulnerabilities, financial stresses, and social distancing perceptions; particularly being young, female, or having a mental illness diagnosis.

However, many of these systems are resource intensive and time-consuming, have low predictive value and are associated with great social and ethical dilemmas. Often drugs appear to be effective and safe in these classical animal models, but later prove to be ineffective and/or unsafe in clinical trials. These issues have paved the way for a paradigm shift from the use of in vivo approaches, toward the 'science of alternatives'. This has fuelled several research and regulatory initiatives, including the ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals. The new paradigm has been shifted toward increasing the relevance of the models for human predictivity and translational efficacy, and this has resulted in the recent development of many new methodologies, from 3-D bio-organoids to bioengineered 'human-on-a-chip' models. These improvements have the potential to significantly advance medical research globally. This paper offers a stance on the existing strategies and practices that utilise alternatives to animals, and outlines progress on the incorporation of these models into basic and applied research and education, specifically in India. It also seeks to provide a strategic roadmap to streamline the future directions for the country's policy changes and investments. This strategic roadmap could be a useful resource to guide research institutions, industries, regulatory agencies, contract research organisations and other stakeholders in transitioning toward modern approaches to safety and risk assessment that could replace or reduce the use of animals without compromising the safety of humans or the environment.","output":"The Implementation of the Three Rs in Regulatory Toxicity and Biosafety Assessment: The Indian Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In two previous papers we have proposed models to estimate the Covid-19 epidemic when the number of daily positive cases has a bell shaped form that we call a mode.

The first case was recorded as viral pneumonia and later became a worldwide pandemic (officially declared by WHO on March 11, 2020). MAIN BODY: SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely infectious and transferrable virus that develops severe conditions like respiratory syndrome, high blood pressure and weakens the immune system. Coronavirus falls under the Coronaviridae family and Beta coronavirus genus. Affected individuals will encounter problems starting with fever followed by severe complications like SARS, ARDS, and many others. These SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enter the host cells by the endosomal pathway, and about 16 non-structural proteins are involved in assembling the viral RNA synthesis complex. They possess a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and about four major genes are mainly associated with the development of ASRD, SARS, and other respiratory problems. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility of these four major genes such as ACE2, IL-2, 7 and 10, TNF, and VEGF is associated with COVID-19. This highlights the identification of the above-mentioned genes that can be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted drug delivery for treating the SARS-CoV-2 neurological symptoms and reducing inflammation in the brain.","output":"Identification of selected genes associated with the SARS-CoV-2: a therapeutic approach and disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: Acute infectious diarrhea in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ? 38.5C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3C7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease.

Traditionally, it has represented a biochemical sign of necrosis, a characteristic of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, with the arrival of high-sensitivity detection assays, cardiac troponin is now detected in healthy people and in a number of uncommon scenarios unrelated to AMI (such as strenuous exercise, rapid atrial pacing and COVID-19). This suggest that troponin could be released as a consequence of alternative processes other than the well-stablished necrotic cell death. To try to explain this phenomenon, multiple mechanisms of troponin release have been postulated, although there is still no consensus on this matter. Furthermore, the term myocardial injury was included in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. This entity is understood as a troponin determination above the upper reference limit, not necessarily associated with a specific diagnosis. Nonetheless, the histological or pathobiological process responsible of myocardial injury has not been determined. Here, we studied the possibility of troponin release through non-classical secretion, a pathway specially triggered by cellular stress and inflammation. Methods The protein sequences of the eight different isoforms of troponin (I, T and C of fast-twitch skeletal, slow-twitch skeletal and cardiac muscle) were retrieved from the UniProtKB database. SecretomeP 2.0, a neural networks-based program, was used to predict if any of these proteins undergoes non-classical release. SignalP 5.0 and TMHMM 2.0 were also applied to rule out the possibility of classical (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi dependent) and Type IV (transmembrane) non-classical secretion. Results and Discussion After analyzing the sequences, the cardiac T isoform was predicted to be non-classically secreted, as well as the I, T and C subunits of the fast-twitch skeletal muscle and the I subunit of the slow-twitch skeletal muscle. Additionally, none of the troponin isoforms was found to be subject to classical or Type IV secretion. The present study provides in silico evidence of cardiac troponin T release by means of non-classical secretion. We believe that this potential new mechanism could contribute to the debate around cardiac troponin high-sensitivity assays. Thus, it might establish a theoretical frame capable of explaining troponin elevations by causes other than myocyte necrosis. Conclusions Troponin T secretion may help in the pathobiological definition of myocardial injury. There are already some experimental studies showing the release of troponin through extracellular microvesicles (a type of non-classical secretion) in various cell lines. Nonetheless, more work is needed to fully understand this intriguing phenomenon in cardiomyocytes.","output":"In silico evidence of cardiac troponin non-classical secretion: new insights on the pathobiology of myocardial injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This contribution aims to shed light on mathematical epidemic dynamics modelling from the viewpoint of analytical mechanics.

Among them, MSMOTE is proposed to solve the problem of the sample biased to the majority class expanded by methods such as GAN in a sample imbalanced environment. Based on the traditional SMOTE method, the sample distance measurement method is modified from Euclidean distance to Mahalanobis distance, taking into account the correlation between attributes and the influence of dimensions on the sample distance. In the data generation model, MSMOTE is used to balance the positive and negative samples in the data.

The approach in this paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time bound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a negligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier certificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of safety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a finite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation over this interval.

Massive increment of cases and deaths occurred in China and 209 countries in Europe, America, Australia, Asia and Pakistan. Pakistan was first hit by COVID-19 when a case was reported in Karachi on 26 February 2020. Several methods were presented to model the death rate due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to forecast the pinnacle of reported deaths. Still, these methods were not used in identifying the first day when Pakistan enters or exits the early exponential growth phase. OBJECTIVE: The present study intends to monitor variations in deaths and identify the growth phases such as pre-growth, growth, and post-growth phases in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: New approaches are needed that display the death patterns and signal an alarming situation so that corrective actions can be taken before the condition worsens. To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered, and the $c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are used To meet this purpose, secondary data on daily reported deaths in Pakistan due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered. The $ c$ and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts have been used for monitoring variations. RESULTS: The chart shows that Pakistan switches from the pre-growth to the growth phase on 31 March 2020. The EWMA chart demonstrates that Pakistan remains in the growth phase from 31 March 2020 to 17 August 2020, with some indications signaling a decrease in deaths. It is found that Pakistan moved to a post-growth phase for a brief period from 27 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. Pakistan switches to re-growth phase with an alarm on 31/7/2020, right after the short-term post-growth phase. The number of deaths starts decreasing in August in that Pakistan may approach the post-growth phase shortly. CONCLUSION: This amalgamation of control charts illustrates a systematic implementation of the charts for government leaders and forefront medical teams to facilitate the rapid detection of daily reported deaths due to COVID-19.

This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted using the baseline data from the ELSA-Brazil (2008-2010). Associations between usual magnesium intake and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Food sources were identified by calculating the percentage contribution of each FFQ item to the amount of magnesium provided by all foods. The analysis was performed using Stata? software (version 12), assuming a statistical significance level of 5%.

The prevalence of hyponatremia associated with coronavirus disease 2019 and the impact on outcome is unknown. We aimed to identify the prevalence, predictors, and impact on outcome of mild, moderate, and severe admission hyponatremia compared with normonatremia among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study. SETTING: Four New York City hospitals that are part of the same health network. PATIENTS: Hospitalized, laboratory-confirmed adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hyponatremia was categorized as mild (sodium: 130-134 mmol/L), moderate (sodium: 121-129 mmol/L), or severe (sodium: &#8804; 120 mmol/L) versus normonatremia (135-145 mmol/L). The primary outcome was the association of increasing severity of hyponatremia and in-hospital mortality assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Secondary outcomes included encephalopathy, acute renal failure, mechanical ventilation, and discharge home compared across sodium levels using Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. In exploratory analysis, the association of sodium levels and interleukin-6 levels (which has been linked to nonosmotic release of vasopressin) was assessed. Among 4,645 patient encounters, hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mmol/L) occurred in 1,373 (30%) and 374 of 1,373 (27%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Mild, moderate, and severe hyponatremia occurred in 1,032 (22%), 305 (7%), and 36 (1%) patients, respectively. Each level of worsening hyponatremia conferred 43% increased odds of in-hospital death after adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index, past medical history, admission laboratory abnormalities, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, renal failure, encephalopathy, and mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.88; p = 0.012). Increasing severity of hyponatremia was associated with encephalopathy, mechanical ventilation, and decreased probability of discharge home (all p < 0.001). Higher interleukin-6 levels correlated with lower sodium levels (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia occurred in nearly a third of coronavirus disease 2019 patients, was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, and was associated with increased risk of encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation.","output":"Prevalence and Impact of Hyponatremia in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive candidiasis is an increasingly frequent cause of serious and often fatal infections in hospitalized and immunosuppressed patients. Mortality rates associated with these infections have risen sharply due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of C. albicans and other Candida spp., highlighting the urgent need of new antifungal therapies. Rhesus theta () defensin-1 (RTD-1), a natural macrocyclic antimicrobial peptide, was recently shown to be rapidly fungicidal against clinical isolates of MDR C. albicans in vitro. Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that -defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis.","output":"Rhesus Theta Defensin 1 Promotes Long Term Survival in Systemic Candidiasis by Host Directed Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this pandemic era there exist a relationship between a sedentary lifestyle during lockdown with periods of anxiety and stress among the population.

Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering.

It is believed that cases of photosensitivity may be underreported, causing inaccurate and inflated reports of mortality. Additionally, because secondary photosensitization in grazing cattle occurs with liver damage or dysfunction, photosensitivity can have many potential or associated causes. This case links a previous occurrence of coccidiosis to an outbreak of photosensitivity in grazing Holstein steers. Grazing management staff first observed clinical signs of photosensitivity 17 days after an outbreak of coccidiosis and subsequent turnout to spring pastures. Clinical signs were observed in 25% of the population. The severity of photosensitivity was variable and ranged from blistered skin on the muzzle to sloughing of unpigmented epidermis and thinly haired regions. Severely affected cattle were removed from pasture, housed under shade, monitored for infection, and recovered without treatment. Mild cases remained on pasture and recovered without treatment. Photosensitivity did not reoccur in the cattle that remained on pasture or in mildly affected cattle returned to pasture. Photosensitivity did not appear to be associated with pasture weeds, a specific forage species, or variable or extreme weather conditions that could have resulted in mycotoxin production. The occurrence appears to have been a result of a previous and concurrent coccidiosis outbreak that caused secondary photosensitization through hepatic lipidosis caused by anorexia and dehydration associated with the severe coccidiosis.

Understanding factors that influence the decision-making of doctors, nurses and paramedics in the emergency setting regarding PIVC insertion, and what factors may modify their decision is essential to identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary cannulations and improve patient-centred outcomes. This study aimed to understand factors associated with clinicians decision-making on whether to insert or use a PIVC in the emergency care setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study using in-depth semistructured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTING: Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, in a large tertiary level emergency department (ED) and local government ambulance service. PARTICIPANTS: Participants recruited were ED clinicians (doctors, nurses) and paramedics who regularly insert PIVCs. RESULTS: From the 15 clinicians interviewed 4 key themes: knowledge and experience, complicated and multifactorial, convenience, anticipated patient clinical course, and several subthemes emerged relating to clinician decision-making across all disciplines. The first two themes focused on decision-making to gather data and evidence, such as knowledge and experience, and decisions being complicated and multifactorial. The remaining two themes related to the actions clinicians took such as convenience and anticipated patient clinical course. CONCLUSION: The decision to insert a PIVC is more complicated than clinicians, administrators and policy-makers may realise. When explored, clinician decisions were multifaceted with many factors influencing the decision to insert a PIVC. In actual practice, clinicians routinely insert PIVCs in most patients as a learnt reflex with little cognitive input. When considering PIVC insertion, more time needs to be devoted to the awareness of: (1) decision-making in the context of the clinicians own experience, (2) cognitive biases and (3) patient-centred factors. Such awareness will support an appropriate risk assessment which will benefit the patient, clinician and healthcare system.","output":"Peripheral intravenous cannulation decision-making in emergency settings: a qualitative descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to evaluate the air quality in the coastal city of Kannur, India, during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. From the Pre1 (March 1C24, 2020) period to the Lock (March 25CApril 19, 2020) and Tri (April 20CMay 9, 2020) periods, the Kerala state government gradually imposed a strict lockdown policy. Both the simulations and observations showed a decline in the PM(2.5) concentrations and an enhancement in the O(3) concentrations during the Lock and Tri periods compared with that in the Pre1 period. Integrated process rate (IPR) analysis was employed to isolate the contributions of the individual atmospheric processes. The results revealed that the vertical transport from the upper layers dominated the surface O(3) formation, comprising 89.4%, 83.1%, and 88.9% of the O(3) sources during the Pre1, Lock, and Tri periods, respectively. Photochemistry contributed negatively to the O(3) concentrations at the surface layer. Compared with the Pre1 period, the O(3) enhancement during the Lock period was primarily attributable to the lower negative contribution of photochemistry and the lower O(3) removal rate by horizontal transport. During the Tri period, a slower consumption of O(3) by gas-phase chemistry and a stronger vertical import from the upper layers to the surface accounted for the increase in O(3). Emission and aerosol processes constituted the major positive contributions to the net surface PM(2.5), accounting for a total of 48.7%, 38.4%, and 42.5% of PM(2.5) sources during the Pre1, Lock, and Tri periods, respectively. The decreases in the PM(2.5) concentrations during the Lock and Tri periods were primarily explained by the weaker PM(2.5) production from emission and aerosol processes. The increased vertical transport rate of PM(2.5) from the surface layer to the upper layers was also a reason for the decrease in the PM(2.5) during the Lock periods.","output":"Integrated process analysis retrieval of changes in ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter during the COVID-19 outbreak in the coastal city of Kannur, India()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play a major role in cancer formation, growth, and progression. One of the important findings in this area is that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene is a negative regulator of wild-type p53. In tumors, expressing wild-type p53, inhibition of MDM2 expression will stabilize p53 and allow it to perform its proapoptotic function, while simultaneously preventing MDM2 from exerting its p53-independent oncogenic effects. The intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by MDM2, as it is a key player in autoregulatory feedback loop under nonstressed conditions. The p53-MDM2 relationship is vital not only for essential functions of the cell, but it also appears to be an integrated part of the complex cellular network which supports the importance of this affair and is a hallmark for its coexistence. Subjects and Methods: This study was designed to identify immunohistochemically the expression of p53 and MDM2 gene using monoclonal antibody in 60 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, of which 20 cases were of solid multicystic ameloblastoma (SMA), 20 cases were of odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and 20 cases were of unicystic ameloblastoma (UA). Results: Immunoexpression of p53 and MDM2 was highest in OKC followed by SMA and was minimum in UA. Further results showed positive correlation between both the molecules.

This decline is understood to have a negative impact on both productivity and wages, and econometric studies fail to support any single cause brought forward. This decline coincides with decreases in household savings, increases in household debt and wage stagnation. We propose that the decline could be the consequence of a complex interaction between mobility, savings, wages and debt, such that if changing jobs incurs costs which are paid out of savings, or incurs debt in the absence of sufficient savings, a negative feedback loop is generated. People are further restricted in making moves by their debt obligations and inability to save, which in turn depresses wages further. To explore this hypothesis, we developed a stylized model in which agents chose their employment situation based on their opportunities and preferences for work and where there are costs to changing jobs and the possibility of borrowing to meet those costs. We indeed found evidence of a negative feedback loop involving changes, wages, savings and debt, as well as evidence that this dynamic results in a level of wealth inequality on the same scale as we see today in the US.","output":"Job Mobility and Wealth Inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a well-known cause of upper and lower respiratory disease, and since 2002 have been a recognized source of potential pandemic spread.

Our research aimed to assess the mechanism of humanin (HN) in promoting autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs. METHODS AND RESULTS Flow cytometry and lipid quantitation results showed that Ox-LDL caused lipid and cholesterol accumulation in HUVECs. Western blot results showed that Ox-LDL increased the expression of autophagy-related proteins P62 and LC3-II in a concentration-dependent manner. The cathepsin D activity assay showed that Ox-LDL inhibited the function of cathepsin D. HNG pretreatment reduced lipid and cholesterol aggregation in HUVECs induced by Ox-LDL, increased LC3-II protein level, decreased P62 protein content, and reversed Ox-LDL-induced cathepsin D functional impairment. Inhibition of the FPRL1 pathway by FPRL1 siRNA or the FPRL1-specific inhibitor Boc-MLF blocked all HNG's protective effects. These results indicate that HNG could restore cathepsin D activity and protein level in HUVECs to repair lysosomal functional damage induced by Ox-LDL, further repairing Ox-LDL-induced autophagic damage in HUVECs. CONCLUSION HNG restores the activity of Ox-LDL-induced damaged lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D through its membrane protein receptor FPRL1 to promote autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs.","output":"[Gly14]-humanin restores cathepsin D function via FPRL1 and promotes autophagic degradation of Ox-LDL in HUVECs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the relationship that both domestic and foreign institutional net equity flows have with the India stock markets The motivation behind is the study to examine whether increased net equity investments from domestic institutional investors has reduced the influence of foreign equity flows on the Indian stock market volatility Our results indicate that only during periods in which domestic equity inflows surpass foreign flows by a significant margin, as seen during 2015?2018, is the Indian stock market volatility not significantly influenced by foreign equity investments However, during periods of re-emergence of strong foreign net inflows, the Indian market volatility is still being impacted significantly, as has been observed since 2019 Furthermore, we find that both large-scale net buying and net selling by domestic funds increased the stock market volatility as observed during 2015?2018 and COVID-impacted year 2020 respectively The implications of this study are multi-fold First, the regulators should discuss with industry bodies before enforcing major structural changes like reconstituting of mutual fund investment mandate in 2017 which forced domestic funds to quickly change portfolio allocation amongst large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks resulting in higher stock market volatility Second, adequate investor educational and awareness programmes need to be conducted regularly for retail investors to minimize herd behaviour of investing during market rise and heavy redemptions at times of fall Third, the economic policies should be stable and forward-looking to ensure foreign investors remain attracted to the Indian stock markets at all times","output":"Do Lower Foreign Flows and Higher Domestic Flows Reduce Indian Equity Market Volatility?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate womens psychological health, family function, and social support during the third trimester within the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.

While short-term chondrocyte viability and chondrosupportive matrix modification have been demonstrated within tissue contiguous to targeted removal of damaged articular cartilage, longer term tissue responses require evaluation to further clarify treatment efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine surface chondrocyte responses within contiguous tissue after lesion stabilization. METHODS Nonablation radiofrequency lesion stabilization of human cartilage explants obtained during knee replacement was performed for surface fibrillation. Time-dependent chondrocyte viability, nuclear morphology and cell distribution, and temporal response kinetics of matrix and chaperone gene transcription indicative of differentiated chondrocyte function were evaluated in samples at intervals to 96 hours after treatment. RESULTS Subadjacent surface articular cartilage chondrocytes demonstrated continued viability for 96 hours after treatment, a lack of increased nuclear fragmentation or condensation, persistent nucleic acid production during incubation reflecting cellular assembly behavior, and transcriptional up-regulation of matrix and chaperone genes indicative of retained biosynthetic differentiated cell function. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study provide further evidence of treatment efficacy and suggest the possibility to manipulate or induce cellular function, thereby recruiting local chondrocytes to aid lesion recovery. Early surgical intervention may be viewed as a tissue rescue, allowing articular cartilage to continue displaying biological responses appropriate to its function rather than converting to a tissue ultimately governed by the degenerative material property responses of matrix failure. Early intervention may positively impact the late changes and reduce disease burden of damaged articular cartilage.","output":"Targeted In Situ Biosynthetic Transcriptional Activation in Native Surface-Level Human Articular Chondrocytes during Lesion Stabilization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stemming is the process of reducing related words to a standard form by removing affixes from them.

The economic crisis and food and health system disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to exacerbate undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We developed pessimistic, moderate and optimistic scenarios for 2020-2022 and used three modelling tools (MIRAGRODEP, the Lives Saved Tool and Optima Nutrition) to estimate the impacts of pandemic-induced disruptions on child stunting, wasting and mortality, maternal anaemia and children born to women with a low body mass index (BMI) in 118 LMICs.

Government legislation forced limited travel on the population with restrictions on the normal way of life to limit spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of lockdown on the presentation of maxillofacial trauma in a level I trauma centre. METHODS: Comparative analysis was carried out using prospective and retrospective review of all consecutive patients admitted with any maxillofacial fracture in the lockdown period between 15th March and 15th June 2020 with the same period in 2019 to a Regional Trauma Maxillofacial Surgery Unit. Data included basic demographics and mechanism of injury including alcohol/drug influence, polytrauma, site of injury and treatment modality including escalation of care. RESULTS: Across both periods, there were a total of one hundred and five (n = 105) recorded episodes of traumatic fractures with fifty-three (n = 53) in the pre-lockdown cohort and fifty-two (n = 52) in the lockdown. Included patients were significantly (p = 0.024) older during lockdown (mean age 41.44 years SD 20.70, range 5C96) with no differences in gender distribution between cohorts (p = 0.270). Patients in lockdown were more likely to be involved in polytrauma (p < 0.05) and have sustained their injury by cycling/running or any outdoor related activity (p = 0.013). Lockdown saw a significant reduction in alcohol and drug related violence (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients required operative management (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Local lockdowns form part of the governments public health strategy for managing future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Our study showed no significant reduction in volume of trauma during lockdown.

METHODS: Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated over 5-430 days on 828 samples across COVID-19 severity levels, for total antibody (TAb), IgG, IgA, IgM, neutralizing antibody (NAb), antibody avidity, and for receptor-binding-domain (RBD), spike (S), or nucleoprotein (N). Specificity was determined on 676 pre-pandemic samples. RESULTS: Sensitivity at 30-60 days post symptom onset (pso) for TAb-S/RBD, TAb-N, IgG-S, IgG-N, IgA-S, IgM-RBD, and NAb was 96.6%, 99.5%, 89.7%, 94.3%, 80.9%, 76.9% and 92.8%, respectively. Follow-up 430 days pso revealed: TAb-S/RBD increased slightly (100.0%); TAb-N decreased slightly (97.1%); IgG-S and IgA-S decreased moderately (81.4%, 65.7%); NAb remained positive (94.3%), slightly decreasing in activity after 300 days; there was correlation with IgG-S (Rs=0.88) and IgA-S (Rs=0.71); IgG-N decreased significantly from day 120 (15.7%); IgM-RBD dropped after 30-60 days (22.9%). High antibody avidity developed against S/RBD steadily with time in 94.3% of patients after 430 days. This correlated with persistent antibody detection depending on antibody-binding efficiency of the test design. Severe COVID-19 correlated with earlier and higher antibody response, mild COVID-19 was heterogeneous with a wide range of antibody reactivities. Specificity of the tests was 99%, except for IgA (96%). CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays was determined by test design, target antigen, antibody avidity, and COVID-19 severity.

After adjusting age and sex, increased level of cTNI was found to significantly associate with the incidence of severe events (HR: 1.007; 95% CI: 1.000-1.013; p = 0.048), Furthermore, using of &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors was found to be the potential protectant for severe events (HR: 0.227; 95% CI: 0.057-0.904; p = 0.035). Conclusion: Diabetes patients with COVID-19 showed poor clinical outcomes. Vigorous monitoring of cTNI should be recommended for the diabetes patients with COVID-19. Usage of &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors could be a potential protectant for the diabetes patients with COVID-19.","output":"Risk Factors for Poor Outcomes of Diabetes Patients With COVID-19: A Single-Center, Retrospective Study in Early Outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To combat the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread, the adoption of technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning is on the rise. However, the seamless integration of IoT devices and deep learning models for radiograph detection to identify the presence of glass opacities and other features in the lung is yet to be envisioned. Moreover, the privacy issue of the collected radiograph data and other health data of the patients has also arisen much concern. To address these challenges, in this paper, we envision a federated learning model for COVID-19 prediction from radiograph images acquired by an X-ray device within a mobile and deployable screening resource booth node (RBN). Our envisioned model permits the privacy-preservation of the acquired radiograph by performing localized learning. We further customize the proposed federated learning model by asynchronously updating the shallow and deep model parameters so that precious communication bandwidth can be spared. Based on a real dataset, the effectiveness of our envisioned approach is demonstrated and compared with baseline methods.","output":"On COVID-19 Prediction Using Asynchronous Federated Learning-Based Agile Radiograph Screening Booths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in data collection methods have been introduced in research to ensure continuity despite physical distancing and lockdown restrictions. However, little is currently known about the potential differences in information collected using these traditional face-to-face methods compared to the incorporation of virtual methods to address the above, particularly in studies involving older adults. Aims Our objectives were, therefore, to compare data collected during the pandemic using hybrid methods from older individuals participating in falls research to that collected through traditional face-to-face methods. Methods Participants comprised of individuals recruited to two fall studies which hurdled the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both studies recruited individuals aged 60 years and over with at least one fall in the past 12 months, and controls with no history of falls in the past 12 months. Pre-pandemic, individuals were interviewed face-to-face exclusively, those interviews after the start of the pandemic were conducted virtually with physical assessments conducted face-to-face to minimize physical contact. Cognitive, physical, and psychological status were determined using the visual cognitive assessment tool (VCAT), timed-up-and-go (TUG), functional reach (FR), handgrip strength (HGS), and the 21-item depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). In addition quality of life, physical activity and social participation were also measured. Results Of the 145 participants (median age (interquartile range, IQR) of 73.5 (67-81) years), 69 (47.6%) were interviewed face-to-face, while 76 (53.4%) were assessed using a hybrid method. Participants in both groups had similar age, gender, ethnic breakdown, marital status, education levels, anthropometric measurements, and medication burden. More face-to-face participants had hypertension and fall compared to hybrid participants Differences were observed in presence of fall characteristics, with fewer fallers seeing a doctor and more fallers attending the emergency department after the start of the pandemic. After adjustment for baseline differences, participants interviewed using hybrid status had lower depression scores (odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI)=0.29(0.14-0.61) and stress scores (OR(95%CI)=0.33(0.15-0.72)), but greater fear of falling (OR(95%CI)=2.16(1.04-4.48)) and reduced social participation (OR(95%CI)=2.64(1.20-5.79)).

Recently, many countries reported their population based antibody titer study results. South Korea recently reported their third antibody formation rate, where it divided the study between the general population and the young male youths in their early twenties. As previously stated, these simple point estimates may be misinterpreted without proper estimation of standard error and confidence intervals. In this article, we provide an updated 95% confidence intervals for COVID-19 antibody formation rate for the Korean population using asymptotic, exact and Bayesian statistical estimation methods. As before, we found that the Wald method gives the narrowest interval among all asymptotic methods whereas mid p-value gives the narrowest among all exact methods and Jeffreys method gives the narrowest from Bayesian method. The most conservative 95% confidence interval estimation shows that as of 00:00 November 23, 2020, at least 69,524 people were infected but not confirmed. It also shows that more positive cases were found among the young male in their twenties (0.22%), three times that of the general public (0.051%).

As infection with SARS-CoV-2 is often asymptomatic, it remains to be determined if vaccine immunogenicity is comparable in all previously infected subjects. We present detailed immunological evidence to clarify the requirements for one- or two-dose primary vaccination series for naturally primed individuals. Objective Evaluate the immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in healthcare workers (HCWs) who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design Multicentric observational prospective cohort study of HCWs with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection designed to evaluate the dynamics of T and B cells immune responses to primary infection and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination over 12 months. Participants Unvaccinated HCWs with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were selected based on the presence or absence of symptoms at infection and serostatus at enrollment. Age- and sex-matched adults not infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination were included as naive controls. Exposure Vaccination with Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Immunity score (zero to three), before and after vaccination, based on anti-RBD IgG ratio, serum capacity to neutralize live virus and IFN-{gamma} secretion capacity in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools above the positivity threshold for each of the three assays. We compared the immunity score between groups based on subjects symptoms at diagnosis and/or serostatus prior to vaccination. Results None of the naive participants (n=14) showed a maximal immunity score of three following one dose of vaccine compared to 84% of the previously infected participants (n=55). All recovered individuals who did not have an immunity score of three were seronegative prior to vaccination, and 67% had not reported symptoms resulting from their initial infection. Following one dose of vaccine, their immune responses were comparable to naive individuals, with significantly weaker responses than those who were symptomatic during infection. Conclusions and Relevance Individuals who did not develop symptoms during their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and were seronegative prior to vaccination present immune responses comparable to that of naive individuals.

The objective of this study was to assess time trends in suicide mortality in Canada by sex and age group. METHODS: We extracted data from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database for all suicide deaths among individuals aged 10 years and older based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision (E950-959; 1981 to 1999) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (X60-X84, Y870; 2000 to 2017) for a 37-year period, from 1981 to 2017. We calculated annual age-standardized, sex-specific, and age group-specific suicide mortality rates, and used Joinpoint Regression for time trend analysis. RESULTS: The age-standardized suicide mortality rate in Canada decreased by 24.0% from 1981 to 2017. From 1981 to 2007, there was a significant annual average decrease in the suicide rate by 1.1% (95% confidence interval, ?1.3 to ?0.9), followed by no significant change between 2007 and 2017. From 1981 to 2017 and from 1990 to 2017, females aged 10 to 24 and 45 to 64 years old, respectively, had a significant increase in suicide mortality rates. However, males had the highest suicide mortality rates in all years in the study; the average male-to-female ratio was 3.4:1. CONCLUSION: The 3-decade decline in suicide mortality rates in Canada paralleled the global trend in rate reductions. However, since 2008, the suicide rate in Canada was relatively unchanged. Although rates were consistently higher among males, we found significant rate increases among females in specific age groups.

A specific, dose-dependent response to the three major recombinant viral proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), purified by affinity chromatography, was characterized. Induction of in vitro antibody synthesis was analyzed. The purified recombinant viral proteins induced the in vitro synthesis of neutralizing TGEV-specific antibodies when porcine TGEV-immune cells were stimulated with each of the combinations made with two of the major structural proteins: S+N, S+M, and to a minor extent with M+N, but not by the individual proteins. S-protein was dissociated from purified virus using NP-40 detergent and then micellar S-protein oligomers (S-rosettes) were formed by removing the detergent. These occurred preferentially by the association of more than 10 S-protein trimmers. These S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins elicited TGEV-specific antibodies with titers up to 84 and 60%, respectively, of those induced by the whole virus. N-protein could be partially substituted by a 15-mer peptide that represents a T helper epitope previously identified in N-protein (Antn et al. (1995)). These results indicate that the induction of high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies requires stimulation by at least two viral proteins, and that optimum responses are induced by a combination of S-rosettes and the nucleoprotein.","output":"Cooperation between transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) structural proteins in the in vitro induction of virus-specific antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum La pandmie de COVID-19 a mis sous tension extrme un systme de sant fond essentiellement sur une organisation locale et rgionale.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic put the French health system, mainly based on local and regional organisation, under tremendously high pressure. During the crisis climax, many hospitals, like the Strasbourg University Hospital, had to rely on backup from available anaesthesiologists, working in spared regions, to relieve healthcare resources and reinforce local teams. This remarkable chain of solidarity compensated for limited healthcare resources and allowed for appropriate, high-level care of severe COVID-19 patients in Strasbourg. Adequate allocation of medical resources required anticipation, reactivity and a skill-oriented dispatch from both administrative and medical perspectives. To maximise its efficacy, this system should focus on facilitating rapid integration of medical resources from abroad in ancillary tasks and ease their rapid acquisition of local protocols. One again, human factor turned out to be the most decisive element in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Organisation dun dtachement pour renfort mdical en situation de crise sanitaire lors de la pandmie COVID-19: retour sur une collaboration entre les CHU de Lille et de Strasbourg"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim: Theoretical and methodological substantiation of the impact of COVID-19 on the implementation of state policy on the protection of human right to health in terms of improving the legal framework in the field of demographic security.

Given the multitude of performance criteria, real-world constraints, and external influences acting upon such a system, even formulating an appropriate research question to address this topic is non-trivial. Here we present an abstraction of a supply and distribution system leading to a minimal model, which only retains stylized facts of the systemic function and, in this way, allows us to investigate the generic properties of robust supply networks. On this level of abstraction, a supply and distribution system is the strategic use of transportation to eliminate mismatches between production patterns (i.e., the amounts of goods produced at each production site of a company) and demand patterns (i.e., the amount of goods consumed at each location). When creating networks based on this paradigm and furthermore requiring the robustness of the system with respect to the loss of transportation routes (edge of the network) we see that robust networks are built from specific sets of subgraphs, while vulnerable networks display a markedly different subgraph composition. Our findings confirm a long-standing hypothesis in the field of network science, namely, that network motifsstatistically over-represented small subgraphsare informative about the robust functioning of a network. Also, our findings offer a blueprint for enhancing the robustness of real-world supply and distribution systems.

This study aimed to assess the pooled incidence of pulmonary embolic events and the prognostic value of such events in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EmBase were systematically searched for eligible studies published on or before October 20, 2021. The pooled incidence of pulmonary embolism was calculated using the random-effects model. Moreover, the prognostic value was assessed by measuring the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR and NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Thirty-six studies involving 10,367 COVID-19 patients were selected for the final meta-analysis. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 was 21% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 18?24%; P<0.001), and the incidence of pulmonary embolism in ICU and non-ICU patients was 26% (95%CI: 22?31%; P<0.001) and 17% (95%CI: 14?20%; P<0.001), respectively. The predictive role of pulmonary embolism in ICU admission was also assessed, and the sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC were 0.31 (95%CI: 0.21?0.42), 0.84 (95%CI: 0.75?0.90), 1.88 (95%CI: 1.45?2.45), 0.83 (95%CI: 0.75?0.91), 2.25 (95%CI: 1.64?3.08), and 0.61 (95%CI: 0.57?0.65), respectively.

The pathophysiology of CRS has some similarities to allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) and includes eosinophilia, T-helper cell 2 cytokines, and local immunoglobilin E formation. Monoclonal antibody therapy has been used successfully in asthma and AR and more recently in CRS. Our was aim to systematically review the literature and identify the role of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the treatment of CRS with polyps (CRSwNP) and without polyps (CRSsNP), especially with regard to comparability with current medical treatment, efficacy, and risk of complications. In addition, the role of surgery and biologics was evaluated. METHODS We identified at total of 5341 relevant studies after a comprehensive database search. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, all 6 randomized, controlled trials. RESULTS Treatment with omalizumab and mepolizumab demonstrated improvements in endoscopic nasal polyp score (EPS) and symptoms score in patients with CRSwNP when compared with placebo. Reslizumab reduced nasal polyp size in patients with raised intranasal interleukin-5 levels. Dupilumab treatment resulted in a 70% reduction in EPS compared with 20% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). These MAbs target different inflammatory markers involved in the pathophysiology of CRSwNP. None of the studies reported on CRSsNP or combined surgery with biologics.

Here, we developed Protein And Nucleic acid IN situ Imaging (PANINI) and coupled it with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) to sensitively and simultaneously quantify DNA, RNA, and protein levels within the microenvironments of tissue compartments. The PANINI-MIBI approach was used to measure over 30 parameters simultaneously across large sections of archival lymphoid tissues from non-human primates that were healthy or infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), a model that accurately recapitulates human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). This enabled multiplexed dissection of cellular phenotypes, functional markers, viral DNA integration events, and viral RNA transcripts as resulting from viral infection. The results demonstrated immune coordination from an unexpected upregulation of IL10 in B cells in response to SIV infection that correlated with macrophage M2 polarization, thus conditioning a potential immunosuppressive environment that allows for viral production. This multiplexed imaging strategy also allowed characterization of the coordinated microenvironment around latently or actively infected cells to provide mechanistic insights into the process of viral latency.

This constant pressure and friction against the skin may contribute to increased wearer pain, irritation, and discomfort. The purpose of this work is to report a modified 3D printed mask extender to alleviate discomfort and increase mask wearability by relieving posterior auricular pressure from isolation masks. METHODS: Our institutional review board designated this project as non-human research and exempt. As part of resourcing 3D printing laboratories along with individual 3D printers to provide resources to healthcare workers, mask extenders were printed to relieve posterior auricular pressure from individuals wearing isolation masks. The authors modifed an existing mask extender, increasing its length with accompanying peripheral rungs for isolation mask securement. 3D printing was performed with Ultimaker S5 (Ultimaker B.V.; Geldermalsen, Netherlands) and CR-10 (Creality3D; Shenzhen, China) 3D printers using polylactic acid filaments. The author's modified extended mask extenders were printed and freely delivered to healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, technologists, and other personnel) at the authors' institution. RESULTS: The final mask extender design was printed with the two 3D printers with a maximum 7 straps printed simultaneously on each 3D printer. Mean print times ranges from 105 min for the Ultimaker S5 printer and 150 min for the CR-10. Four hundred seventy-five mask extenders were delivered to healthcare workers at the authors' institution, with the demand far exceeding the available supply. CONCLUSION: We offer a modification of a 3D printed mask extender design that decreases discomfort and increases the wearability of isolation mask designs with ear loops thought to relieve posterior auricular skin pressure and ability to control strap tension.

High Levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education outcomes and provision of non-Covid-19 healthcare. Weekly and monthly officially published values in 2020/21 were used to estimate the impact of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 by age group, on the economy and healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. It was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. The results show vaccinations are significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to a rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57,000 life years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next 4 months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around 0.4 million/life-year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting give significantly different trade-offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing.

However, the mechanisms behind the coronavirus infection are not yet fully understood, nor are there any targeted treatments or vaccines. In this study, we identified high-binding-affinity aptamers targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD, using an ACE2 competition-based aptamer selection strategy and a machine learning screening algorithm. The Kd values of the optimized CoV2-RBD-1C and CoV2-RBD-4C aptamers against RBD were 5.8 nM and 19.9 nM, respectively. Simulated interaction modeling, along with competitive experiments, suggests that two aptamers may have partially identical binding sites at ACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These aptamers present an opportunity for generating new probes for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 while providing a new tool for in-depth study of the mechanisms behind the coronavirus infection.","output":"Discovery of Aptamers Targeting the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An embryonic Chinese state emerged in the fertile Huang He (Yellow River) basin before 4000 BC.

Although no study has been done on malnutrition among a general cohort of patients with COVID 19, it has long been associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with COVID 19 admitted in a tertiary government hospital. METHODS: Cross-sectional study on COVID 19-confirmed patients admitted to the COVID 19 wards from July 15 to September 15, 2020. Nutritional status was assessed using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (PhilSPEN) modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade (SGA) tool. Malnutrition was defined as those with SGA grades B and C. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test of association, as appropriate, was used to identify factors that have a significant association with malnutrition. Furthermore, logistic regression was done on factors with significant association. RESULTS: Among the 355 adult patients in the study, 71.83% (255/355) were malnourished [SGA B: 67.84% (173/255); SGA C: 32.16% (82/255)]. The following were shown to have significant association with malnutrition: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [p-value < 0.001], hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [p-value 0.002], and chronic kidney disease (p-value 0.033). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that age [OR 1.02, CI 95% 1.00, 1.04, p-value 0.027] and CAP-Moderate Risk (MR) [OR 3.02, CI 95% 1.73, 5.27, p-value < 0.001] are significant predictors of malnutrition.

When lifting certain mandatory measures for an economic restart, robust surveillance must be established and implemented, with nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 as an essential component. Methods: : We tried to develop a o ne-tube detection platform based on R T- R PA (Reverse Transcription and Recombinase Polymerase Isothermal Amplification) and D NA E ndonuclease- T arg e ted C RISPR T rans R eporter ( DETECTR ) technology, termed OR-DETECTR, to detect SARS-CoV-2. We designed RT-RPA primers of the RdRp and N genes following the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence. We optimized reaction components so that the detection process could be carried out in one tube. Specificity was demonstrated by detecting nucleic acid samples from pseudoviruses from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1). Clinical samples were used to validate the platform and all results were compared to rRT-PCR. RNA standards and pseudoviruses diluted by different gradients were used to demonstrate the detection limit. Additionally, we have developed a lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR for detecting COVID-19. Results: : The OR-DETECTR detection process can be completed in one tube, which takes approximately 50 min. This method can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1), with a low detection limit of 2.5 copies/l input (RNA standard) and 1 copy/l input (pseudovirus). Results of six samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients, eight samples from patients with fever but no SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one mixed sample from 40 negative controls showed that OR-DETECTR is 100% consistent with rRT-PCR. The lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR can be used for the detection of COVID-19, and the detection limit is 2.5 copies/l input.

In this study, we investigate the association between FGR & parental SCOV2 infection at a county hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Study Design: A prospective cohort study was created by matching patients who had positive SCOV2 (PSCOV2) and negative SCOV2 (NSCOV2) PCR tests between 1/2020-4/2021 utilizing an institutional database. Cohorts were drawn from patients who received a 3rd trimester ultrasound (3TUS) & were matched by gestational age & month SCVO2 testing was performed. FGR was present when estimated fetal weight (EFW) was 10% or abdominal circumference (AC) 10% at time of either late 2nd or 3rd trimester ultrasound. Sample size calculations were performed to investigate a 15% difference in FGR rate requiring 74 subjects per group. Univariate analyses, chi-square tests and logistic regression were performed. Regression models were adjusted for comorbidities including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and maternal race. Results: 157 subjects were in the analyses (n=78 PSCOV2 and n=79 NSCVO2). 83.4% (n =131) self-identified as African American. FGR rates were 15.3% and 16.4% among PSCOV2 and NSCOV2 respectively. After adjusting for confounders, no difference in FGR was observed between the groups (adjusted OR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.46-2.73). Absolute EFW at time of FGR diagnosis was lower in PSCOV2 vs NSCOV2 (1,250 grams vs.1,337 grams, p= 0.015), a relationship that remained after adjusting for confounders (p=0.015). Conclusion: Our data suggest that despite a high background FGR rate (15.2%), there was no significant association between FGR and SCOV2. Also, EFW was lower in PSCOV2 cohort vs NSCOV2 cohort. Therefore, unlike other viral illnesses, while SCOV2 may not clinically drive FGR, further studies are necessary to investigate the effects of maternal SCVO2 on fetal growth & examine whether growth exams improve outcomes in this setting.","output":"Association between maternal Sars-Co-V2 infection and fetal growth restriction (FGR) at a single county hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen En este artculo se muestran las publicaciones que hemos considerado ms relevantes sobre cardiopatas congnitas en el ltimo a?o La pandemia de COVID-19ha marcado este periodo e implica un gran desafo en el tratamiento de los pacientes con cardiopatas congnitas Se han publicado mltiples guas y consensos (hipertensin pulmonar, seguimiento mediante tcnicas de imagen, exploracin ecogrfica del corazn fetal y tratamiento de arritmias) que sern de gran utilidad en la estandarizacin del tratamiento de estos pacientes complejos Queremos destacar los trabajos relacionados con la estratificacin de riesgo de muerte sbita y el tratamiento de la insuficiencia cardiaca avanzada, y en el caso de los pacientes peditricos, cmo los avances en el manejo de los posibles donantes estn consiguiendo reducir la siempre larga lista de espera para el trasplante cardiaco peditrico Por ltimo, el intervencionismo percutneo a cualquier edad y las tcnicas quirrgicas, con especial inters en las tcnicas de reconstruccin valvular artica en ni?os y jvenes, siguen avanzando y explorando caminos hasta ahora insospechados This paper shows a selection of the most relevant articles in congenital heart diseases published since the end of the last year The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for the care of patients with congenital heart diseases Multiple guidelines and consensus have been published (pulmonary hypertension, multimodality imaging during follow-up, ultrasound examination of the fetal heart and management of arrhythmias) and will be very useful for the standardization of the management of these complex patients We highlight contributions related to risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and advanced heart failure therapies for patients with congenital heart disease In this regard, the long waiting lists for pediatric heart transplantation are being reduced due to the progress in the management of potential donors Finally, percutaneous interventions at any age and surgical techniques, with a particular focus on aortic valve leaflet reconstruction techniques in children and young adults, continue to develop and explore new paths previously unexpected","output":"Seleccin de lo mejor del a?o 2020 en cardiopatas congnitas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a promising approach to stop the escalation of the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccine promotion is becoming a challenging task for authorities worldwide.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 244 patients presenting between 01/03/2020 and 17/07/2020. Three sources of data were sought: patients presenting to A&E with signs of appendicitis, operative logs for patients who underwent removal of their appendix and all CT/US scans where the clinician had queried appendicitis in the request. RESULTS: 139 patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics (57.0%). 35 (25.2%) represented within 6 months. Conservative treatment was successful in 92.1% of cases. 65 appendectomies were completed during that time. 45 cases presented acutely whereby the surgical management of acute appendicitis was the primary choice. The decision to operate was due to: 13 (20%) because the patient was 16 or younger. 4 cases presenting with signs of severe sepsis. 4 cases had a complicated appendicitis on their imaging results. 22 (33.8%) cases were completed without initial conservative management. 9 (3.7%) cases failed conservative treatment thus requiring surgical management. 11 (4.5%) cases represented within 6 months due to recurrent appendicitis despite successful antibiotic treatment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar in October 2020 and performed a follow-up search in July 2021. We screened articles based on their abstracts and keywords in their text, reviewed potentially relevant articles, and screened their references to (a) assess whether the article met inclusion criteria and (b) identify additional articles. Chatbots, their use cases, and chatbot design characteristics were extracted from the articles and information from other sources and by accessing those chatbots that were publicly accessible. RESULTS: Our search returned 3334 articles, 61 articles met our inclusion criteria, and 61 chatbots deployed in 30 countries were identified. We categorized chatbots based on their public health response use case(s) and design. Six categories of public health response use cases emerged comprising 15 distinct use cases: risk assessment, information dissemination, surveillance, post-Covid eligibility screening, distributed coordination, and vaccine scheduler. Design-wise, chatbots were relatively simple, implemented using decision-tree structures and predetermined response options, and focused on a narrow set of simple tasks, presumably due to need for quick deployment.

In Canada, there is limited data to quantify and characterize this issue. METHODS We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by distributing online surveys to physicians across Ontario. The survey included three sections: provider characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, and impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization services. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with modification of immunization services. RESULTS A total of 475 respondents answered the survey from May 27th to July 3rd 2020, including 189 family physicians and 286 pediatricians. The median proportion of in-person visits reported by physicians before the pandemic was 99% and dropped to 18% during the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario. In total, 175 (44.6%) of the 392 respondents who usually provide vaccination to children acknowledged a negative impact caused by the pandemic on their immunization services, ranging from temporary closure of their practice (n = 18; 4.6%) to postponement of vaccines in certain age groups (n = 103; 26.3%). Pediatricians were more likely to experience a negative impact on their immunization services compared to family physicians (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.48-4.68), as well as early career physicians compared to their more senior colleagues (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.30-5.56), whereas physicians from suburban settings were less impacted than physicians from urban settings (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99). Some of the proposed solutions to decreased immunization services included assistance in accessing personal protective equipment, dedicated centers or practices for vaccination, universal centralized electronic immunization records and education campaigns for parents. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has caused substantial modifications to pediatric immunization services across Ontario. Strategies to mitigate barriers to immunizations during the pandemic need to be implemented in order to avoid immunity gaps that could lead to an eventual increase in vaccine preventable diseases.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of routine childhood immunizations in Ontario, Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to explore the role of strategic leadership under conditions of uncertainty and unpredictability. The authors argue that highly improbable, but high-impact events require the upper echelons of management, traditionally the custodians of strategy formulation to offer a new kind of strategic leadership focused on new mindsets, organizational capabilities, more in tune with high uncertainty and unpredictability. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on strategic leadership, and complexity leadership theory, the authors review the literature and present a conceptual framework for exploring the nature of strategic leadership under uncertainty. The authors conceptualize organizations as complex adaptive systems and discuss the imperatives for developing new mental models for emergent leadership. Findings: Strategic leaders have a key role to play in preparing their organizations for episodic disruptions. These include developing their adaptive capabilities and building resilient organizations to ensure their organizations cannot only bounce back after a disruption but have the capacity for transformation to new fitness levels when necessary. Strategic leaders must engage with complexity leadership by seeing their organizations as complex adaptive systems, reconfigure their leadership approaches and organizations to build strategic adaptive capability. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual paper and the authors cannot make any claims of causality. Practical implications: Organizational leaders need to reconfigure their mental models and leadership approaches to reflect the new normal of uncertainty and unpredictability. Developing the strategic adaptive capability of organizations should prepare them for dealing with high impact events. To assure business continuity in the face of disruptions requires building flexible, adaptable business models. Originality/value: The paper focuses on how managers can offer strategic leadership for a new normal that challenges some of our most cherished leadership and strategic management paradigms.

Our study was aimed at determining the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine intention in the Saudi Arabian population. A structured questionnaire guided by the Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy was administered during a span of two months among the general population from all administrative regions of Saudi Arabia, proceeding the launch of the vaccination campaign. In total, 879 out of 1600 subjects responded and completed the survey (response rate 54.9%). About 56 percent of the participants intended to be vaccinated. The predictors of a higher intention to vaccinate included those 50 years of age or older, male subjects, people suffering from systemic disease/s, subjects who were not previously infected with COVID-19, those who follow the updates about COVID-19 vaccines, and adults with a higher level of anxiety about contracting coronavirus (p < 0.05).

Based on past studies, two tremor frequency windows of similar size were chosen at 3.0-6.5 Hz and 6.6-10.0 Hz to reflect major tremor intensities in Parkinson's disease and mercury vapor poisoning, respectively. In 81 healthy controls, total tremor intensity was higher for the preferred hand and depended on age. Ten patients treated for Parkinson's disease showed substantially increased tremor intensity, especially within the low-frequency window. This pattern was also apparent in 14 patients with de novo Parkinson's disease whose overall tremor intensity was only mildly elevated. In contrast, ten patients with essential tremor had peak frequencies in both windows, and some patients had increased tremor on one side only. Sixty-three Brazilian gold traders exposed to mercury vapor showed increased tremor predominantly in the high-frequency window. Three of the gold traders had a narrower tremor peak at frequencies of 7-8 Hz. While the urine-mercury concentration was significantly associated with the current number of burning sessions per week, it did not correlate with tremor intensities. However, eight traders had a urinary mercury excretion level above 50 microg and at the same time a greatly increased average tremor intensity within the high-frequency window. These patterns were statistically significant for relative tremor intensities, but were less clear when total intensities were used. These observations suggest that the relative distribution of tremor intensities in specific frequency bands may be a valuable supplement to current diagnostic methods for subjects with mercury vapor exposure.","output":"Tremor frequency patterns in mercury vapor exposure, compared with early Parkinson's disease and essential tremor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the implementation of programs across educational institutions. Nursing students, being both young adults and by practical training, part of the health care system, may be particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between self-reported fear of COVID-19, general health, psychological distress and overall quality of life (QoL) in a sample of Norwegian undergraduate nursing students compared to reference data. Methods: The survey targeted baccalaureate nursing students from five universities in February 2021. An electronic questionnaire consisted of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 5 (SCL-5), one general health and one overall QoL question. The respondents mean scores were compared to reference data. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, and effect sizes (Cohens d) were evaluated. Results: In total, 2605 out of 6088 (43%) students responded. Their FCV-19S scores (mean 2.45, CI: 2.42, 2.48) were significantly higher than those of the reference population (mean 1.8, P< 0.001). Nursing students scores showed significantly lower general health (mean 3.50  0.93 SD, population mean = 3.57, Cohens d = 0.07), higher levels of psychological distress (mean 2.68  1.03 SD, population mean = 2.12, Cohens d = 0.55) and lower overall QoL (mean 5.50  2.16 SD, population mean = 8.00, Cohens d = 1.16) compared to pre-pandemic reference data. FCV-19S scores were significantly associated with levels of general health (Cohens d = 0.26), psychological distress (Cohens d = 0.76) and overall QoL (Cohens d = 0.18). Conclusions: Baccalaureate nursing students reported worse outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic on general health, psychological distress and overall QoL compared to the reference population. Level of fear of Covid-19, however, accounted for few of these differences. Other factors related to the pandemic may have reduced nursing students overall QoL.","output":"Quality of life and fear of COVID-19 in 2600 baccalaureate nursing students at five universities C a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS. METHODS: We retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks. To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS. We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data. RESULTS: With our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R(0) to be 069 (95% CI 050C092); by contrast, the R(0) for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 080 (054C113). Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R(0) of 060 (042C080). Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R(0) would exceed 1ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

Pelvic and lower limb MR images of 378 patients with vascular malformations were examined retrospectively. Pain levels and restriction of motion were evaluated with a questionnaire. Cross-sectional areas of affected nerves were compared at standardized anatomical landmarks. Intraneural infiltration patterns and involvement of muscles surrounding the sciatic nerve were documented. Sciatic nerve infiltration occurred in 23/299 patients (7.7%) with VM. In all cases (23/23; 100%), gluteal or hamstring muscles surrounding the nerve were affected by the VM. Infiltrated nerves were enlarged and showed signal alterations (T2-hyperintensity) compared to the unaffected side. Enlarged nerve cross-sectional areas were associated with elevated pain levels. Three nerve infiltration patterns were observed: subepineurial (12/23; 52.2%), subparaneurial (6/23; 26.1%) and combined (5/23; 21.7%) infiltration.

In health care facilities, CRAB readily contaminates the patient care environment and health care providers' hands, survives for extended periods on dry surfaces, and can be spread by asymptomatically colonized persons; these factors make CRAB outbreaks in acute care hospitals difficult to control (2,3). On May 28, 2020, a New Jersey hospital (hospital A) reported a cluster of CRAB infections during a surge in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospital A and the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) conducted an investigation, and identified 34 patients with hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant CRAB infection or colonization during February-July 2020, including 21 (62%) who were admitted to two intensive care units (ICUs) dedicated to caring for COVID-19 patients. In late March, increasing COVID-19-related hospitalizations led to shortages in personnel, personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical equipment, resulting in changes to conventional infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. In late May, hospital A resumed normal operations, including standard IPC measures, as COVID-19 hospitalizations decreased, lessening the impact of personnel and supply chain shortages on hospital functions. CRAB cases subsequently returned to a pre-COVID-19 baseline of none to two cases monthly. The occurrence of this cluster underscores the potential for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) to spread during events when standard hospital practices might be disrupted; conventional IPC strategies should be reinstated as soon as capacity and resources allow.","output":"Increase in Hospital-Acquired Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection and Colonization in an Acute Care Hospital During a Surge in COVID-19 Admissions  New Jersey, FebruaryCJuly 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parametric Markov chains (pMCs) are Markov chains with symbolic (aka: parametric) transition probabilities. They are a convenient operational model to treat robustness against uncertainties. A typical objective is to find the parameter values that maximize the reachability of some target states. In this paper, we consider automatically proving robustness, that is, an [Formula: see text] -close upper bound on the maximal reachability probability. The result of our procedure actually provides an almost-optimal parameter valuation along with this upper bound. We propose to tackle these ETR-hard problems by a tight combination of two significantly different techniques: monotonicity checking and parameter lifting. The former builds a partial order on states to check whether a pMC is (local or global) monotonic in a certain parameter, whereas parameter lifting is an abstraction technique based on the iterative evaluation of pMCs without parameter dependencies.

However, the emergence of novel variants of concerns has highlighted the importance of high population-based vaccine rates to effectively suppress viral transmission and breakthrough infections. While initially left out from vaccine efforts, children have become one of the most affected age groups and are key targets to stop community and household spread. Antibodies are central for vaccine induced protection and emerging data points to the importance of additional Fc effector functions like opsononophagocytosis or cytotoxicity, particularly in the context of variants of concern that escape neutralizing antibodies. Here, we observed delayed induction and reduced magnitude of vaccine induced antibody titers in children 5-11 years receiving two doses of the age recommended 10 g dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine compared to adolescents (12-15 years) or adults receiving the 30 g dose. Conversely, children mounted equivalent or more robust neutralization and opsonophagocytic functions at peak immunogenicity, pointing to a qualitatively more robust humoral functional response in children. Moreover, broad cross-variants of concern responses were observed across children, with enhanced IgM and parallel IgG cross-reactivity to variants of concern (VOCs) in children compared to adults. Collectively, these data argue that despite the lower magnitude of the BNT162b2 induced antibody response in children, vaccine induced immunity in children target VOCs broadly and exhibit enhanced functionality that may contribute to attenuation of disease.","output":"BNT162b2 induces robust cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 immunity in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a 3.2 kb DNA genome and causes acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV infection is a global health problem, with 350 million chronically infected people at increased risk of developing liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methylation of HBV DNA in a CpG context (5mCpG) can alter the expression patterns of viral genes related to infection and cellular transformation. Moreover, it may also provide clues as to why certain infections are cleared or persist with or without progression to cancer. The detection of 5mCpG often requires techniques that damage DNA or introduce bias through a myriad of limitations. Therefore, we developed a method for the detection of 5mCpG on the HBV genome that does not rely on bisulfite conversion or PCR. With Cas9-guided RNPs to specifically target the HBV genome, we enriched in HBV DNA from primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) infected with different HBV genotypes, as well as enriching in HBV from infected patient liver tissue, followed by sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. Detection of 5mCpG by nanopore sequencing was benchmarked with bisulfite-quantitative methyl-specific qPCR (BS-qMSP). The 5mCpG levels in HBV determined by BS-qMSP and nanopore sequencing were highly correlated. Our nanopore sequencing approach achieved a coverage of ~2000 of HBV depending on infection efficiency, sufficient coverage to perform a de novo assembly and detect small fluctuations in HBV methylation, providing the first de novo assembly of native HBV DNA, as well as the first landscape of 5mCpG from native HBV sequences. Moreover, by capturing entire HBV genomes, we explored the epigenetic heterogeneity of HBV in infected patients and identified four epigenetically distinct clusters based on methylation profiles. This method is a novel approach that enables the enrichment of viral DNA in a mixture of nucleic acid material from different species and will serve as a valuable tool for infectious disease monitoring.","output":"Cas9-targeted nanopore sequencing reveals epigenetic heterogeneity after de novo assembly of native full-length hepatitis B virus genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancers occurring at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) are classified as predominantly esophageal or gastric, which is often difficult to decipher. We hypothesized that the transcriptomic profile might reveal molecular subgroups which could help to define the tumor origin and behavior beyond anatomical location. The gene expression profiles of 107 treatment-na?ve, intestinal type, gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas were assessed by the Illumina-HTv4.0 beadchip. Differential gene expression (limma), unsupervised subgroup assignment (mclust) and pathway analysis (gage) were undertaken in R statistical computing and results were related to demographic and clinical parameters. Unsupervised assignment of the gene expression profiles revealed three distinct molecular subgroups, which were not associated with anatomical location, tumor stage or grade (p > 0.05). Group 1 was enriched for pathways involved in cell turnover, Group 2 was enriched for metabolic processes and Group 3 for immune-response pathways. Patients in group 1 showed the worst overall survival (p = 0.019). Key genes for the three subtypes were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The newly defined intrinsic subtypes were analyzed in four independent datasets of gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas with transcriptomic data available (RNAseq data: OCCAMS cohort, n = 158; gene expression arrays: Belfast, n = 63; Singapore, n = 191; Asian Cancer Research Group, n = 300).

ICPs exist in both membrane and soluble forms in vivo and in vitro. Imbalances between inhibitory and stimulatory membrane-bound ICPs (mICPs) in malignant cells and immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been well documented. Blockades of inhibitory mICPs have emerged as an immense breakthrough in cancer therapeutics. However, the origin, structure, production regulation, and biological significance of soluble ICPs (sICPs) in health and disease largely remains elusive. Soluble ICPs can be generated through either alternative mRNA splicing and secretion or protease-mediated shedding from mICPs. Since sICPs are found in the bloodstream, they likely form a circulating immune regulatory system. In fact, there is increasing evidence that sICPs exhibit biological functions including (1) regulation of antibacterial immunity, (2) interaction with their mICP compartments to positively or negatively regulate immune responses, and (3) competition with their mICP compartments for binding to the ICP blocking antibodies, thereby reducing the efficacy of ICP blockade therapies. Here, we summarize current data of sICPs in cancer and infectious diseases. We particularly focus on sICPs in COVID-19 and HIV infection as they are the two ongoing global pandemics and have created the worlds most serious public health challenges. A storm of sICPs occurs in the peripheral circulation of COVID-19 patients and is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Similarly, sICPs are highly dysregulated in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and some sICPs remain dysregulated in PLHIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), indicating these sICPs may serve as biomarkers of incomplete immune reconstitution in PLHIV on ART. We reveal that HIV infection in the setting of alcohol misuse exacerbates sICP dysregulation as PLHIV with heavy alcohol consumption have significantly elevated plasma levels of many sICPs. Thus, both stimulatory and inhibitory sICPs are present in the bloodstream of healthy people and their balance can be disrupted under pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, COVID-19, HIV infection, and alcohol misuse. There is an urgent need to study the role of sICPs in immune regulation in health and disease.","output":"Soluble Immune Checkpoints Are Dysregulated in COVID-19 and Heavy Alcohol Users With HIV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and work inefficiency are three dimensions that define burnout syndrome among teachers.

In addition to the conventional production system, the analysis also included 5 alternative animal welfare systems representative of the Netherlands. The study was limited to the most prevalent and economically relevant endemic diseases in the broiler farms. Health care costs consisted of losses and expenditures. The study investigated whether higher animal welfare standards increased health care costs, in both absolute and relative terms, and also examined which cost components (losses or expenditures) were affected and, if so, to what extent. The results show that health care costs represent only a small proportion of total production costs in each production system. Losses account for the major part of health care costs, which makes it difficult to detect the actual effect of diseases on total health care costs. We conclude that, although differences in health care costs exist across production systems, health care costs only make a minor contribution to the total production costs relative to other costs, such as feed costs and purchase of 1-d-old chicks.","output":"Effects of different broiler production systems on health care costs in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new normal for nurses is a push to revitalize the profession, especially for emergency nurses.

But the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the governments of China, Russia, and the two Koreas have instead chosen to pursue a less politically messy agenda of sweeping it under the proverbial carpet. Despite the adoption of the human security agenda by the international community, these refugees who have fled North Korea to escape the widespread starvation and poverty brought about by large-scale famines since the 1990s seem to have fallen through the gaps. This chapter examines the efficacy, or the lack thereof, of the human security paradigm in the nexus between politics and refugees.

This trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 4] were included. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner. Control arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days. Outcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients. Eleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 C recovered; 9 C false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis. Clinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 per cent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms. Virological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24). Nine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization. Patients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct<35) and infectivity (Ct<33).

Tumour recurrence is not detected with high sensitivity by established blood tumour markers. Ameloblastin is identified as an extracellular matrix protein and has shown to be associated with tumour progression. We validated ameloblastins expression in testicular tissue, and used comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of 156 patients with testicular germ cell tumour to show that the level of ameloblastin was associated with the time of tumour recurrence after the first cure. In the analysis of ameloblastin differential genes in the tumour, a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) regulatory network associated with tumour diagnosis and an independent prognostic factor for the tumour, PELATON (Plaque Enriched LncRNA In Atherosclerotic And Inflammatory Bowel Macrophage Regulation), were identified, which could provide evidence for prediction of tumour prognosis. ABSTRACT: Testicular Germ Cell Tumour (TGCT) is one of the most common tumours in young men. Increasing evidence shows that the extracellular matrix has a key role in the prognosis and metastasis of various human cancers. This study analysed the relationship between the matrix protein ameloblastin (AMBN) and potential biological markers associated with TGCT diagnosis and prognosis. The relationship between AMBN and TGCT prognosis was determined by bioinformatic analysis using the expression profiles of three RNAs (long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and available clinical information of the corresponding patients. Prediction and validation of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks related to AMBN was performed. AMBN and its associated ceRNA regulatory network were found to be related to the recurrence of TGCT, and LINC02701 may be used as a diagnostic factor in TGCT. Furthermore, we identified PELATON (Plaque Enriched LncRNA In Atherosclerotic And Inflammatory Bowel Macrophage Regulation) as an independent prognostic factor for TGCT progression-free interval.","output":"Comprehensive Analysis Identifies Ameloblastin-Related Competitive Endogenous RNA as a Prognostic Biomarker for Testicular Germ Cell Tumour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 are important for epidemiology, clinical management, and infection control. Limitations of oro-nasopharyngeal real-time PCR sensitivity have been described based on comparisons of single tests with repeated sampling. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 PCR clinical sensitivity using a clinical and radiological reference standard. METHODS: Between March-May 2020, 2060 patients underwent thoracic imaging and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Imaging was independently double- or triple-reported (if discordance) by blinded radiologists according to radiological criteria for COVID-19. We excluded asymptomatic patients and those with alternative diagnoses that could explain imaging findings. Associations with PCR-positivity were assessed with binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: 901 patients had possible/probable imaging features and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and 429 patients met the clinical and radiological reference case definition. SARS-CoV-2 PCR sensitivity was 68% (95% confidence interval 64-73), was highest 7-8 days after symptom onset (78% (68-88)) and was lower among current smokers (adjusted odds ratio 0.23 (0.12-0.42) p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with clinical and imaging features of COVID-19, PCR test sensitivity was 68%, and was lower among smokers; a finding that could explain observations of lower disease incidence and that warrants further validation.

To achieve this goal, we propose an alternative approach to the methodology exploiting survey data, which is based solely on data from administrative registers and online sources and relies on dual system estimation (DSE). As these sources do not cover the whole reference population and the number of units appearing in all datasets is small, we have developed a DSE approach for negatively dependent sources based on a recent work by Chatterjee and Bhuyan (2020). To achieve the main goal we conducted a thorough data cleaning procedure in order to remove out-of-scope units, identify entities from the target population, and link them by identifiers to minimize linkage errors. We verified the effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed estimator in simulation studies. From a practical point of view, our results show that the current vacancy survey in Poland underestimates the number of entities with at least one vacancy by about 10-15%. The main reasons for this discrepancy are non-sampling errors due to non-response and under-reporting, which is identified by comparing survey data with administrative data.","output":"Estimating the number of entities with vacancies using administrative and online data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of the new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in 2020, the spread of fake news has caused serious social panic. Fake news often uses multimedia information such as text and image to mislead readers, spreading and expanding its influence. One of the most important problems in fake news detection based on multimodal data is to extract the general features as well as to fuse the intrinsic characteristics of the fake news, such as mismatch of image and text and image tampering. This paper proposes a Multimodal Consistency Neural Network (MCNN) that considers the consistency of multimodal data and captures the overall characteristics of social media information. Our method consists of five subnetworks: the text feature extraction module, the visual semantic feature extraction module, the visual tampering feature extraction module, the similarity measurement module, and the multimodal fusion module. The text feature extraction module and the visual semantic feature extraction module are responsible for extracting the semantic features of text and vision and mapping them to the same space for a common representation of cross-modal features. The visual tampering feature extraction module is responsible for extracting visual physical and tamper features. The similarity measurement module can directly measure the similarity of multimodal data for the problem of mismatching of image and text. We assess the constructed method in terms of four datasets commonly used for fake news detection. The accuracy of the detection is improved clearly compared to the best available methods.","output":"Detecting fake news by exploring the consistency of multimodal data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over one million deaths thus far. There is an urgent need for the development of specific viral therapeutics and a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly expressed upon infection and is essential for viral replication, making it a promising target for both antiviral drug and vaccine development. Here, starting from a functional proteomics workflow, we initially catalogued the protein-protein interactions of 21 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in HEK293 cells, finding that the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2 copurify with N with high specificity. We demonstrate that N protein expression in human cells sequesters G3BP1 and G3BP2 through its physical interaction with these proteins, attenuating stress granule (SG) formation. The ectopic expression of G3BP1 in N-expressing cells was sufficient to reverse this phenotype. Since N is an RNA-binding protein, we performed iCLIP-sequencing experiments in cells, with or without exposure to oxidative stress, to identify the host RNAs targeted by N. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds directly to thousands of mRNAs under both conditions. Like the G3BPs stress granule proteins, N was found to predominantly bind its target mRNAs in their 3UTRs. RNA sequencing experiments indicated that expression of N results in wide-spread gene expression changes in both unstressed and oxidatively stressed cells. We suggest that N regulates host gene expression by both attenuating stress granules and binding directly to target mRNAs.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein attenuates stress granule formation and alters gene expression via direct interaction with host mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberrant or constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) contributes to various human inflammatory diseases and malignancies via the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastasis. Thus, inhibition of NF-B signaling has potential for therapeutic applications in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We reported previously that Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase, is involved in the preferential repair of oxidized DNA bases from the transcriptionally active sequences via the transcription-coupled base excision repair pathway. We have further shown that Neil2-null mice are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)- and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Both TNF and lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of NF-B. However, the underlying mechanism of NEIL2's role in the NF-BCmediated inflammation remains elusive. Here, we have documented a noncanonical function of NEIL2 and demonstrated that the expression of genes, such as Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Il6, and Tnf, involved in inflammation and immune cell migration was significantly higher in both mock- and TNF-treated Neil2-null mice compared with that in the WT mice. NEIL2 blocks NF-B's binding to target gene promoters by directly interacting with the Rel homology region of RelA and represses proinflammatory gene expression as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Remarkably, intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 via a noninvasive nasal route significantly abrogated binding of NF-B to cognate DNA, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory genes and neutrophil recruitment in Neil2-null as well as WT mouse lungs. Our findings thus highlight the potential of NEIL2 as a biologic for inflammation-associated human diseases.","output":"Intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 abrogates NF-BCmediated inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objectives To describe the clinical implications of wearing a mask among special populations in inpatient rehabilitation.

Main Outcome Measures Effect of mask wearing on exercise outcomes, including perceived exertion, shortness of breath, and patient perception; clinical implications for the interdisciplinary team. Results Five trials which observed exercise outcomes after mask wearing were identified and summarized. Findings for the effect of face masks on exercise and vital signs varied due to heterogeneity of exercise protocols and outcome measures. Relevant findings show that patients who wore masks had higher ratings of perceived exertion, increased shortness of breath, and feelings of claustrophobia while wearing a face mask during exercise. Wearing masks affected physical and mental outcomes despite exercise intensity (low, moderate, or high). Conclusions Moderate-to-high intensity exercise is needed for neuroplasticity. This type of exercise may not be possible in neurological populations, who do not have normal oxygen consumption at rest or with exercise, and may be further affected by wearing masks. Clinicians should their patients' mask wearing into consideration, and change the frequency, intensity, timing and types of exercises when patients are wearing a face mask. Frequent measurement of vital signs and fatigue symptoms are critical to maintain patient safety, and adjustments should be made as necessary. Other neurological challenges to monitor include impaired cognitive function, limited communication, reduced mood, and interactions with medications. These can affect the patients' ability to accurately determine and state their perceived effort or may hinder physiological and autonomic responses. Lastly, interdisciplinary teams should communicate patient findings related to mask wearing at team conferences, huddles and include discussion for ways to increase patients' participation and how to optimize health outcomes.

Concordantly, high app adoption rates were a stipulated prerequisite for success. Early studies on potential adoption were encouraging. Several factors predicting adoption rates were investigated, especially pertaining to user characteristics. Since then, several countries have released COVID-19 contact tracing apps. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary aim is to investigate the quality characteristics of national European COVID-19 contact tracing apps, thereby shifting attention from user to app characteristics. The secondary aim is to investigate associations between app quality and adoption. Finally, app features contributing to higher app quality were identified. METHODS: Eligible COVID-19 contact tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app use voluntariness. The Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess app quality. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two human-computer interaction scientists, independently conducted Mobile App Rating Scale ratings. To investigate associations between app quality and adoption rates and infection rates, Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the average app adoption rate of 22.9% (SD 12.5%) was below the level recommended by simulation studies. Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate was calculated by assuming apps achieve the highest ratings. The mean best-case adoption rates for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. Overall, we identified 5 feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. Associations between higher app adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app use might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others.

Methods: This retrospective observational study included 152 patients (89 received regdanvimab and 63 did not) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 between August 2021 and October 2021 and admitted to Armed Forces Goyang Hospital. We collected information on the use of regdanvimab, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen; symptom severity score (SSS); and laboratory test results. A linear mixed-effects model was used to test the effectiveness of regdanvimab usage on SSS and the results of laboratory tests. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for additional therapeutic options, such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen. Results: The patients who received regdanvimab were older, showed a higher rate of vaccination, and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index, initial body temperature, and percentages of pneumonia at admission. The use of regdanvimab showed no interactive effects on the SSS and laboratory findings. Older age, male sex, obesity, high initial body temperature, and the presence of pneumonia at admission were associated with increased ORs for the use of these additional treatments. The use of regdanvimab reduced the probability of requiring additional therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, and oxygen supplementation by 90.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 60.3C97.6), 85.8% (95% CI, 34.2C96.9), and 89.8% (95% CI, 48.3C98), respectively.

Even after recovery, patients are prone to a variety of mental health problems. Recently, some studies focus on the psychological situation of patients when they got COVID-19. However, no study focused on the psychological status of recovered COVID-19-infected patients in China. Our study aims to investigate sleep and mood status, and detect the influencing factors of the psychological status of the COVID-19 patients after recovery. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February to April 2020. The social demographic information of all participants was collected by a self-designed questionnaire. Insomnia and depression symptoms were evaluated through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D). RESULTS: The rates of insomnia and depression were 26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. There were significant differences in physical, mental impairment, and the need for psychological assistance between the COVID-19 recovered patients with depression and the patients without depression. In addition, age and health status may be the influencing factors for insomnia, and care about the views of others may be the influencing factor of depression (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we found that COVID-19 recovered patients had a low rate of depression and a high rate of insomnia.

Lockdown measures have been widely adopted to limit the diffusion of COVID-19, indirectly supporting the capacity of the hospital system to face the pandemic. Lockdown obliges people to change their social behaviour significantly, and consequently is a matter of serious concern amongst the population. For this reason, how people react to lockdown is of the utmost importance, since failure to observe it properly will be of little benefit in reducing contagion. In this rationale, factors correlated with individuals behaviour could affect the efficacy of such measures. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether differences in institutional quality and social capital are correlated with the efficacy of lockdown measures, taking the Italian provinces as a case study. Using a quantitative analysis employing F-GLS estimators, our results suggest that both local social capital and institutional quality have affected the efficiency of lockdown measures in Italian provinces. In general terms these factors contribute to forming the set of incentives able to promote individual behaviour that is in closer compliance with government choices. In this perspective, institutional quality and social capital can be considered factors able to influence the efficacy of policies.","output":"Social capital, quality of institutions and lockdown.

Patients diagnosed with PTMS are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and frequently experience decreased physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Studies in the early posttransplant period (<1 year) have shown the benefits of facility-based exercise training on physical function and HRQL, but have not evaluated the effects on metabolic risk factors. It remains unclear whether home-based exercise programs are feasible and can be delivered at a sufficient exercise dose to have effects on PTMS. This protocol outlines the methodology of a randomized controlled trial of a partly supervised home-based exercise program in lung transplant (LTx) and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, recruitment rate, program adherence, attrition, safety, and participant satisfaction) of a 12-week individualized, home-based aerobic and resistance training program in LTx and OLT recipients initiated 12 to 18 months after transplantation, and to assess estimates of intervention efficacy on metabolic risk factors, exercise self-efficacy, and HRQL. METHODS: In total, 20 LTx and 20 OLT recipients with 2 cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 to 18 months after transplantation will be randomized to an intervention (home-based exercise training) or control group. The intervention group will receive an individualized exercise prescription comprising aerobic and resistance training, 3 to 5 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will meet on a weekly basis (via videoconference) with a qualified exercise professional who will supervise exercise progression, provide support, and support exercise self-efficacy. Participants in both study groups will receive a counseling session on healthy eating with a dietitian at the beginning of the intervention. For the primary aim, feasibility will be assessed through recruitment rate, program adherence, satisfaction, attrition, and safety parameters. Secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks, including assessments of metabolic risk factors (ie, insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, blood pressure, and cholesterol), HRQL, and exercise self-efficacy. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize program feasibility and effect estimates (means and 95% CIs) for sample size calculations in future trials. RESULTS: Enrollment started in July 2021. It is estimated that the study period will be 18 months, with data collection to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: A partly supervised home-based, individually tailored exercise program that promotes aerobic and resistance training and exercise self-efficacy may be an important intervention for improving the metabolic profile of LTx and OLT recipients with cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, characterizing the feasibility and effect estimates of home-based exercise constitutes the first step in developing future clinical trials designed to reduce the high morbidity associated with PTMS.

Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, fine-tuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures.

However, large-scale proteomics has led to a massive identification of proteins translated from mRNAs of alternative ORF (AltORFs), in addition to the predicted proteins issued from the reference ORF or from ncRNAs. These alternative proteins (AltProts) are not represented in the conventional protein databases and this Ghost proteomewas not considered until recently. Some of these proteins are functional and there is growing evidence that they are involved in central functions in physiological and physiopathological context. Based on our experience with AltProts we have got interested in finding out their involvement in development of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak. Thus, we have scrutinized the recently published data by Krogan and coworkers (2020) on the SARS-CoV-2 interactome with host cells by co-IP in the perspective of drug repurposing. The initial work has revealed the interaction between 332 human cellular RefProts with the 27 viral proteins. Re-interrogation of this data using 23 viral targets and including AltProts, followed by enrichment of the interaction networks, leads to identify 218 RefProts (in common to initial study) plus 56 AltProts involved in 93 interactions.

It is defined as a reversible myocardial dysfunction, usually with apical ballooning aspect due to apical akinesia associated with hyperkinetic basal left ventricular contraction. Described in cases of viral infections such as influenza, only few have been reported associated with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the recent pandemic. Case summary: A 79-years-old man, with cardiovascular risk factors (type 2 diabetes and hypertension) and chronic kidney disease, presented to the emergency room for severe dyspnea after 8 days of presenting respiratory symptoms and fever. Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, but he presented marked inflammatory syndrome. He was transferred to an intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation within 6 h, due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He presented circulatory failure 2 days after, requiring norepinephrine support (up to up to 1.04 g/kg/min). Troponin T was elevated (637 ng/l). ECG showed diffuse T wave inversion. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 40%), with visual signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac failure resolved after 24 h with troponin T decrease (433 ng/l) and restoration of cardiac function (LVEF 60% with regression of Takotsubo features). Patient died after 15 days of ICU admission, due to septic shock from ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Cardiac function was then normal. Conclusion: Mechanisms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in viral infections include catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity and inflammation related to sepsis. Differential diagnoses include myocarditis and myocardial infarction.

In addition to the direct effect (e.g., being infected with the virus), this pandemic has negatively ravaged many industries, particularly food retail, food services, and hospitality. Given the novelty of the disease, the true impact of COVID-19 remains to be determined. Because of the nature of their work, and the characteristics of the workers, individuals in the food retail, food service, and hospitality industries are a group whose vulnerability is at its most fragile state during this pandemic. Through this qualitative study, we explored workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and coping, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Twenty-seven individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Four key themes emerged: being infected and infecting others, the unknown, isolation, and work and customer demands. Considering the many uncertainties of COVID-19, workers in these three industries were experiencing heightened levels of mental distress because of where they worked and the already existing disparities they faced on a daily basis before the pandemic started. Yet they remained hopeful for a better future. More studies are needed to fully understand the magnitude, short-term, and long-term effects of COVID-19.

This so-called map-matching process can be achieved in several ways. In this paper, a novel real-time map-matching approach was developed, using a backtracking particle filter that benefits from the implemented geospatial analysis, which reduces the complexity of spatial queries and provides flexibility in the use of different kinds of spatial constraints. The goal was to generalize the algorithm to permit the use of any kind of odometry data calculated by different sensors and approaches as the input. Further research, development, and comparisons have been done by the easy implementation of different spatial constraints and use cases due to the modular structure.

The identification of aphid genes and proteins mediating virus transmission is critical to develop agriculturally sustainable virus management practices and to understand viral strategies for circulative movement in all insect vectors. Two cyclophilin B proteins, S28 and S29, were identified previously in populations of Schizaphisgraminum that differed in their ability to transmit the RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV). The presence of S29 was correlated with F2 genotypes that were efficient virus transmitters. The present study revealed the two proteins were isoforms, and a single amino acid change distinguished S28 and S29. The distribution of the two alleles was determined in 12 F2 genotypes segregating for CYDV-RPV transmission capacity and in 11 genetically independent, field-collected S . graminum biotypes. Transmission efficiency for CYDV-RPV was determined in all genotypes and biotypes. The S29 isoform was present in all genotypes or biotypes that efficiently transmit CYDV-RPV and more specifically in genotypes that efficiently transport virus across the hindgut. We confirmed a direct interaction between CYDV-RPV and both S28 and S29 using purified virus and bacterially expressed, his-tagged S28 and S29 proteins. Importantly, S29 failed to interact with a closely related virus that is transported across the aphid midgut. We tested for in vivo interactions using an aphid-virus co-immunoprecipitation strategy coupled with a bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. This analysis enabled us to identify a third cyclophilin protein, cyclophilin A, interacting directly or in complex with purified CYDV-RPV. Taken together, these data provide evidence that both cyclophilin A and B interact with CYDV-RPV, and these interactions may be important but not sufficient to mediate virus transport from the hindgut lumen into the hemocoel.","output":"Genomic and Proteomic Analysis of Schizaphis graminum Reveals Cyclophilin Proteins Are Involved in the Transmission of Cereal Yellow Dwarf Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long COVID-19 may be defined as patients who, four weeks after the diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection, continue to have signs and symptoms not explainable by other causes The estimated frequency is around 10% and signs and symptoms may last for months The main long-term manifestations observed in other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) are very similar to and have clear clinical parallels with SARS-CoV-2: mainly respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric The growing number of patients worldwide will have an impact on health systems Therefore, the main objective of these clinical practice guidelines is to identify patients with signs and symptoms of long COVID-19 in primary care through a protocolized diagnostic process that studies possible etiologies and establishes an accurate differential diagnosis The guidelines have been developed pragmatically by compiling the few studies published so far on long COVID-19, editorials and expert opinions, press releases, and the authors' clinical experience Patients with long COVID-19 should be managed using structured primary care visits based on the time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection Based on the current limited evidence, disease management of long COVID-19 signs and symptoms will require a holistic, longitudinal follow up in primary care, multidisciplinary rehabilitation services, and the empowerment of affected patient groups","output":"Long Covid-19: Proposed Primary Care Clinical Guidelines for Diagnosis and Disease Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum and aqueous humor samples, collected from 14 clinically normal cats and 96 cats with clinical evidence of intraocular inflammation, were assayed with ELISA for Toxoplasma gondii-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), T gondii-specific IgG, T gondii-specific antigens, total IgG, and total IgM.

By contrast, gut Th22 cells are usually restored at normal frequencies. Th22 cells display a CCR6+CCR10+ phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.","output":"Th22 cells are efficiently recruited in the gut by CCL28 as an alternative to CCL20 but do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s41870-020-00504-x.].","output":"Correction To: Editorial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), together with its suppressive binding partner Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), regulates cellular antioxidant response and drug metabolism.

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigacin Farmacoepidemiolgica en Atencin Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11a??390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (390%) were female and the mean age was 691 years (SD 154), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 198, 95% CI 162-241) and risk factors (146, 123-173) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 094 (95% CI 077-115). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 080, 064-100) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (110, 088-137).

There have been significant regional and national differences in the scope and timing of these disruptions. Many hospitals were forced to temporarily halt elective neurointerventional procedures with the first wave of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, in order to prioritize allocation of resources for acutely ill patients and also to minimize coronavirus disease 2019 transmission risks to non-acute patients, their families, and health care workers. This temporary moratorium on elective neurointerventional procedures is generally credited with helping to flatten the curve and direct scarce resources to more acutely ill patients; however, there have been reports of some delaying seeking medical care when it was in fact urgent, and other reports of patients having elective treatment delayed with the result of morbidity and mortality. Many regions have resumed elective neurointerventional procedures, only to now watch coronavirus disease 2019 positivity rates again climbing as winter of 2020 approaches. A new wave is now forecast which may have larger volumes of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients than the earlier wave(s) and may also coincide with a wave of patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza.

National data demonstrate that increased sugar consumption, a high daily caloric intake, and low levels of daily physical activity are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Further, genetic factors such as variations in the androgen receptor may compound the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms in some patients. A diet high in sugar in combination with a low level of physical activity may increase blood glucose levels and impair glucose metabolism. Recent data show that patients admitted to the hospital with high levels of fasting blood glucose are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, elevated glucose levels resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vitro.

Immunosuppressive cells including T regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are key players in immunological tolerance and immunoregulation; however, they contribute to the pathogenesis of different diseases including infections. Tregs have been shown to impair the protective role of CD8(+) T lymphocytes against viral infections. In COVID-19 patients, most studies reported reduction, while few other studies found elevation in Treg levels. Moreover, Tregs have a dual role, depending on the different stages of COVID-19 disease. At early stages of COVID-19, Tregs have a critical role in decreasing antiviral immune responses, and consequently reducing the viral clearance. On the other side, during late stages, Tregs reduce inflammation-induced organ damage. Therefore, inhibition of Tregs in early stages and their expansion in late stages have potentials to improve clinical outcomes. In viral infections, MDSC levels are highly increased, and they have the potential to suppress T cell proliferation and reduce viral clearance. Some subsets of MDSCs are expanded in the blood of COVID-19 patients; however, there is a controversy whether this expansion has pathogenic or protective effects in COVID-19 patients.

Exposure of zucchini seedlings to Hogland solution containing 0.28 mmol L-1 Ni(NO3)2 reduced plant growth, the content of chlorophyll and carotenoids and the relative water content (RWC) in leaves, increased Ni accumulation that was accompanied to depletion of the essential bivalent cations and induced oxidative stress and proline accumulation in both shoots and roots. Pretreatment with the nutrient solution containing 15 mmol L-1 calcium chloride (CaCl2), significantly improved zucchini growth and photosynthetic pigment contents and maintained RWC in leaves under both control and Ni stress conditions. Pretreatment with CaCl2 reduced Ni accumulation, modified cation homeostasis, increased the activities of peroxidase and catalase enzymes and lowered Ni-induced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and proline in leaves and roots. Pre-exposure of root with Ca2+ chelator (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) and plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker (lanthanum chloride) impaired impact of Ca2+ on the aforementioned attributes.

A prepared questionnaire was sent to the members of the Georgia and Illinois communities. RESULTS: In our current study, the COVID-19 vaccine willingness rate was 94.5% and vaccination rate was 90.9%. In multivariate analysis believing to have enough information about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (OR: 3.730, 95% CI: 1.199C11.603, p: 0.023) and gender (OR: 0.123, 95% CI: 0.016C0.967, p: 0.046) were significant predictors for vaccine willingness.

Our analysis covers 54 settlements representing all the different levels of the settlement network from large cities to small villages. We examined the webpages and Facebook pages of local governments and mayors, first during the first wave and then during the second and third waves of the pandemic. Recognizing their responsibility, local governments clearly tried to provide information to the inhabitants as quickly as possible. They considered the online interfaces the most effective, but the online communication had typically been complemented by information published on more traditional channels as well. There were no significant differences in terms of the way and characteristics of communication among the different types of settlements, although local governments of different sizes obviously had to face different challenges in terms of the amount of tasks they had to tackle. The communication process was a very difficult task because of the lack of information and the not-transparent data provision. Even on the Facebook pages especially suitable for this purpose, interactivity rumbled, and in many cases the questions and suggestions of the inhabitants remained unanswered.

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection. Methods: A multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to three study groups: vaccinated (n=86); PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n=65), and unvaccinated non-infected controls (n=62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD and N). Results: BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (Anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer rate was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared to second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.

Unprotected exposure to a COVID-19 patient is a key risk factor for HCWs. Transmission mainly occurs by droplet transmission, or by aerosol generating procedures. Respirators such as filtering face piece masks (FFP2), also called respirators, are required to prevent transmission during aerosol generating procedures, as part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs. However, many HCW were infected due to lack of PPE, or failure to use them. Therefore, the worldwide shortage of respirators triggered the development of reprocessing used FFP2 respirators or N95 respirators as standard in the US. Our proposal with H2O2 plasma sterilization for decontamination allows to reprocess FFP2, while they still meet the filtration efficiency required by EN 149. The protocol is simple, uses available resources in hospitals and can be rapidly implemented to decrease the shortage of respirators during this crisis. The goal of the study was the evaluate if respirators can be reprocessed and still fulfill the requirements for filtration efficiency outlined by EN 149. METHODS: Used FFP2 respirators - Model 3 M Aura&#8482; 1862+ - were sterilized using a low temperature process hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), V-PRO? maX Low Temperature, a FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved method to decontaminate FFP2 respirators. Decontaminated respirators were further checked for residual peroxide by a single-gas detector for H2O2. The total inward leakage of the protective respirators was quantitatively tested with 10 test persons in an atmosphere charged with paraffin aerosol according to the European Standard EN 149. The fit factor was calculated as the inverse of the total inward leakage. RESULTS: Ten new and ten decontaminated FFP2 respirators were tested for filtration efficiency. None of the respirators exceeded the maximum acceptable concentration of peroxide. More than 4000 respirators have been reprocessed so far, at cost of approximately 0.3 Euro/piece. CONCLUSIONS: FFP2 respirators can be safely reprocessed once after decontamination with plasma peroxide sterilization, whereafter they still fulfill EN 149 requirements.

METHODS: We cultured two groups of MG63 cells. One group was treated with PEMFs for 18 hours whereas the second was maintained in the same culture condition without PEMFs (control). Gene expression was evaluated throughout cDNA microarray analysis containing 19,000 genes spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome. RESULTS: PEMFs induced the upregulation of important genes related to bone formation (HOXA10, AKT1), genes at the transductional level (CALM1, P2RX7), genes for cytoskeletal components (FN1, VCL), and collagenous (COL1A2) and noncollagenous (SPARC) matrix components. However, PEMF induced downregulation of genes related to the degradation of extracellular matrix (MMP-11, DUSP4).

RESULTS: In 214 patients, the mean difference of vMGII between the vPASS \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" groups was -14.2  1.4 (95% confidence interval, -16.9 to -11.3; P < .001) with mean vMGII for vPASS \\"Yes\\" group being 6.4  7.7 and vPASS \\"No\\" being 20.5  11.5. A vMGII of 11.5 or higher predicted vPASS \\"yes\\" response with a sensitivity of 78.7% and specificity of 81.4%. A strong negative correlation was found between the vMGII and vSSQ (r = -.667; P < .001). The mean vMGII was 0.48  1.42 for patients in remission, and 9.31  10.93 for improved, 9.32  8.79 for stable, and 22.58  14.04 for worsened groups (P < .001). These associations were the same as those obtained during the preceding in-person clinic visit and the direction of change in MGII scores also indicated change in disease status. DISCUSSION: vMGII is an effective measure to assess an MG patient's disease status in telephone consultations and relates well with other PRO measures. The vMGII remains reliable for assessing MG disease status even with removal of the physical examination component.","output":"Telephone consultation for myasthenia gravis care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessment of a novel virtual myasthenia gravis index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently published case reports relating to anesthesia in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reviewed. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by positive results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous reports handled emergency cesarean delivery. Primary symptoms and laboratory data of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant patients. Although the mortality rate is reported to be high after surgery in patients with COVID-19, cesarean delivery was successfully performed under regional anesthesia in most cases and postoperative course was favorable both in the parents and newborns. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in a newborn two hours after delivery from a pregnant woman with COVID-19, based on the increased immunoglobulin levels and deranged liver function, suggesting that its possibility cannot be completely eliminated. Emergency cerebral shunt reconstruction was performed repeatedly in an eight-month-old boy with COVID-19. The tracheal tube was removed in the operating room after surgery and postoperative course was uneventful.

Of the extracellular vesicles, exosomes are the most widely sorted and extensively explored for their contents and function. The size of the nanovesicular structures (exosomes) range from 30 to 140 nm and are present in various biological fluids such as saliva, plasma, urine etc. These cargo-laden extracellular vesicles arise from endosome-derived multivesicular bodies and are known to carry proteins and nucleic acids. Exosomes are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cellular senescence. Exosomes mediate signaling crosstalk and play a critical role in cellCcell communications. Exosomes have evolved as potential biomarkers for aging-related diseases. Aging, a physiological process, involves a progressive decline of function of organs with a loss of homeostasis and increasing probability of illness and death. The review focuses on the classic view of exosome biogenesis, biology, and age-associated changes.

The right internal jugular vein (RIJV) is the first choice recommended, with ultrasound (US)-guided as the gold standard. This method is not always available, especially in rural settings or developing countries, and complications are still frequent even under expert hands. The head-down tilt (Trendelenburg) position involves elevation of the lower limbs to favor venous return and increase neck veins regurgitation. Evidence is scarce and contradicting regarding the safety of degree of inclination and head rotation. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of different degrees of Trendelenburg and head rotation on the RIJV and right common carotid artery (RCCA). METHODS An experimental, longitudinal, prospective, analytical study was performed. Healthy adults of both sexes were recruited to voluntarily participate. INCLUSION CRITERIA adults between 18 and 29 years of age, with normal vital signs, and a BMI 24.9. Those with RIJV pathology, anatomical variations, neck surgeries, COVID, or metabolic diseases were excluded. Neck US-imaging was performed, obtaining cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of RIJV and RCCA, and their relationship, at the inferior level of the thyroid cartilage. Randomization at Trendelenburg positions of 0, 5, 10 and 15 and left head-rotation of 0, 45 and 90 in each inclination were performed. Vital signs and oxygen saturation were monitored between each position, as well questioning for discomfort symptoms. RESULTS Measurement of the RIJV and RCCA area was performed in 54 healthy participants (30 men), age range 21-32. RIJV basal CSA was 1.00.5mm2 in a supine position (0) without head rotation (0). Trendelenburg angle and head-rotation increased the CSA of the RIJV in a statistically significant way, obtaining the greatest area in a 15 Trendelenburg position and maximum rotation (Table 1). This, in turn, had no statistically significant difference with 10 Trendelenburg and 45 rotation (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS A 5o, 10o, or 15o Trendelenburg position and contralateral head rotation increase RIJV CSA. Head rotation also changes the location of the vein anterior to the RCCA at maximum rotation, but not significantly at 45o. Although the greatest area obtained is achieved at the 15o Trendelenburg position with 90o head rotation, this position is uncomfortable and does not have statistical difference with 10o Trendelenburg position with 45 to 90o head rotation, which represents an increase of the initial diameter of 60% of CSA, making it a feasible position. Although Ultrasound-guided catheterization is the gold-standard, Trendelenburg position and 45o head rotation help increase RIJV diameter, to create a safer procedure. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS This study provides anatomical evidence of RIJV changes with Trendelenburg and head rotation. Most international guidelines focus on CVC approach, and fail to mention patient positioning. The publishing of this data will aid with future versions of CVC guidelines.","output":"Anatomical changes of the internal jugular vein with Trendelenburg position and head rotation.

DESIGN.: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING.: ICU of an academic county hospital in Los Angeles, CA admitted from March 15-June 20, 2020. PATIENTS.: 77 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 75 patients met inclusion criteria. RESULTS.: 21% of patients with severe COVID-19 sustained barotrauma (33% of patients receiving IMV, 8% of patients receiving (NIV). There were no differences between the barotrauma and non-barotrauma groups regarding demographics, illness severity, or medications received, nor tidal volume or average/peak airway pressures in those receiving IMV. In the barotrauma group there was a greater proportion of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (81% vs. 47%, p = 0.023) and ventilated using airway pressure release ventilation mode (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.043). Barotrauma was associated with increased likelihood of receiving a tracheostomy (OR 2.58 [0.23-4.9], p = 0.018]), longer median ICU length of stay (17 days vs. 7 days, p = 0.03), and longer median length of hospitalization (26 days vs. 14 days, p < 0.001).

While there was a trend toward increased mortality in patients with barotrauma, this did not reach statistical significance.

To date, clinical evidence and guidelines based on reliable data and randomized clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 are lacking. In the absence of definitive management protocols, many treatments for COVID-19 are currently being evaluated and tested worldwide. Some of these options were soon abandoned due to ineffectiveness, while others showed promising results. The basic treatments are mainly represented by antiviral drugs, even if the evidence is not satisfactory. Among the antivirals, the most promising appears to be remdesivir.

A condition of hypercoagulability has been frequently reported in COVID-19 patients, and this very fact may complicate KRT management. Sustained Low Efficiency Dialysis (SLED) is a hybrid dialysis modality increasingly used in critically ill patients since it allows to maintain acceptable hemodynamic stability and to overcome the increased clotting risk of the extracorporeal circuit, especially when Regional Citrate Anticoagulation (RCA) protocols are applied. Notably, given the mainly diffusive mechanism of solute transport, SLED is associated with lower stress on both hemofilter and blood cells as compared to convective KRT modalities. Finally, RCA, as compared with heparin-based protocols, does not further increase the already high hemorrhagic risk of patients with AKI. Based on these premises, we performed a pilot study on the clinical management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 associated AKI who underwent SLED with a simplified RCA protocol. Low circuit clotting rates were observed, as well as adequate KRT duration was achieved in most cases, without any relevant metabolic complication nor worsening of hemodynamic status.","output":"Sustained low-efficiency dialysis with regional citrate anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 associated AKI: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique dietary fiber composition with high contents of -glucan contributes to the health-promoting properties of oat and barley and may mediate a reduction of colon cancer risk. In the present study, chemopreventive effects of oat and barley (beta?barley) kernels were investigated. In order to address the impact of thermal processing on these effects, kernels were roasted (150-180 C, approx. 20 min), digested and fermented using an In Vitro human digestion model. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia were determined in fermentation supernatants (FS). Growth inhibition, apoptosis, DNA integrity and gene expression of catalase were analyzed in LT97 colon adenoma cells. Concentrations of SCFA, particularly butyrate, were higher in oat/barley FS (2.2-fold, on average), while ammonia levels were significantly lower (0.7-fold, on average) than in the fermentation control. Treatment of LT97 cells with FS of oat/barley kernels led to a significant time- and dose-dependent growth reduction, a significant increase in caspase-3 activity and enhanced levels of catalase mRNA, without exhibiting genotoxic effects. In general, the results indicate a chemopreventive potential of In Vitro fermented oat and waxy winter barley mediated mainly by growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects, which are preserved after thermal processing.","output":"Thermal Processing has no Impact on Chemopreventive Effects of Oat and Barley Kernels in LT97 Colon Adenoma Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Satisfactory indoor thermal environments can improve working efficiencies of office staff. To build such satisfactory indoor microclimates, individual thermal comfort assessment is important, for which personal clothing insulation rate ([Formula: see text]) and metabolic rate (M) need to be estimated dynamically. Therefore, this paper proposes a vision-based method. Specifically, a human tracking-by-detection framework is implemented to acquire each persons clothing status (short-sleeved, long-sleeved), key posture (sitting, standing), and bounding box information simultaneously. The clothing status together with a key body points detector locate the persons skin region and clothes region, allowing the measurement of skin temperature ([Formula: see text]) and clothes temperature ([Formula: see text]), and realizing the calculation of [Formula: see text] from [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. The key posture and the bounding box change across time can category the persons activity intensity into a corresponding level, from which the M value is estimated. Moreover, we have collected a multi-person thermal dataset to evaluate the method. The tracking-by-detection framework achieves a mAP(50) (Mean Average Precision) rate of 89.1% and a MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) rate of 99.5%. The [Formula: see text] estimation module gets an accuracy of 96.2% in locating skin and clothes. The M estimation module obtains a classification rate of 95.6% in categorizing activity level.

We evaluated operator 3D motion sickness while using a VR simulator and assessed whether it can be reduced by repeating the training. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Urology, Iwate Medical University, a tertiary training hospital in an urban setting. A total of 30 undergraduate medical students participated in the study. We compared whether the VR simulator improved the students skills in operating the da Vinci robot. Fifteen students underwent training with a VR simulator for 4 h a day for 5 days. Then, motion sickness was determined using the Visual Analog Scale and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) before and after the training. RESULTS: Manipulation time significantly improved after training compared to before training (293.9  72.4 versus 143.6  18.4 s; p < 0.001). Although motion sickness worsened after each training session, it gradually improved with continuous practice with the VR simulator. SSQ subscores showed that the VR simulator induced nausea, disorientation, and oculomotor strain, and oculomotor strain was significantly improved with repeated training. CONCLUSIONS: In undergraduate students, practice with the VR simulator improved RAS skills and operator 3D motion sickness caused by 3D manipulation of the da Vinci robot.

Methods: A total of 102 patients with T2DM and proteinuria who underwent renal biopsy were included in this study. According to pathological classification of the kidney, the patients were divided into two groups, namely, a DN group (52 cases) and a non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) group (50 cases). The clinical data were collected, and the factors associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram model for predicting DN risk was constructed by using R4.1 software. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, and the K-fold cross-validation method was used for validation. A consistency test was performed by generating the correction curve. Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetic retinopathy (DR), hemoglobin (Hb), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and triglyceride/cystatin C (TG/Cys-C) ratio were independent factors for DN in T2DM patients with proteinuria (P<0.05). The nomogram model had good prediction efficiency. If the total score of the nomogram exceeds 200, the probability of DN is as high as 95%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.9412 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8981-0.9842). The 10-fold cross-validation showed that the prediction accuracy of the model was 0.8427. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test showed that there was no significant difference between the predicted value and the actual observed value (X 2 = 6.725, P = 0.567).

To provide convenient, safe, and effective home treatment programs for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC), the clinical efficacy and safety of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) (including olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib) monotherapy as a maintenance treatment for platinum-sensitive ROC were systematically evaluated. Methods Numerous electronic databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PARPi maintenance treatment for ROC that were published before June 2021. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs). After data extraction and the quality evaluation of the included studies, Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using R software. The ability of each treatment was ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. Results The analysis included five studies and 1390 patients. The NMA results demonstrated that compared with the placebo, olaparib and niraparib exhibited significant benefits in the gBRCA-mutated population, and respectively reduced the risk of death by 31% (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.90) and 34% (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99). Olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib were all found to be very effective in prolonging PFS in patients with ROC. All three PARPi treatments increased the number of grade 3-4 AEs in patients with ROC as compared with the placebo. Conclusions Overall, olaparib and niraparib maintenance treatment can significantly prolong the OS of patients with gBRCA mutations. Furthermore, the three investigated PARPi monotherapy maintenance treatments can prolong PFS regardless of BRCA mutation status. Although the incidence of AEs in the treatment groups was found to be significantly higher than that in the placebo group, the patients in the treatment group tolerated the treatment. Home oral PARPi treatment can balance tumor treatment and pandemic prevention and control, and is the most convenient, safe, and effective home treatment method available against the background of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

These data support the need for early post-fracture interventions to help reduce imminent hip fracture risk and high societal and humanistic costs. PURPOSE: This large retrospective cohort study aimed to provide hip fracture data, in the context of other fractures, to help inform efforts related to hip fracture prevention focusing on post-fracture patients. METHODS: A cohort of 115,776 patients (72.3% female) aged > 65 (median age 81) with an index fracture occurring at skeletal sites related to age-related bone loss between January 1, 2011, and March 31, 2015, was identified using health services data from Ontario, Canada, and followed until March 31, 2017. RESULTS: Hip fracture was the most common second fracture (27.8%), occurring in  19% of cases after each index fracture site and most frequently (33.0%) after hip index fracture. Median time to a second fracture of the hip was ~ 1.5 years post-index event. Patients with index hip fracture contributed the most to fracture-related initial surgeries (64.1%) and post-surgery complications (71.9%) and had the second-highest total mean healthcare cost per patient in the first year after index fracture ($62,793  44,438). One-year mortality (any cause) after index hip fracture was 26.2% vs. 15.9% in the entire cohort, and 25.9% after second hip fracture. CONCLUSION: A second fracture at the hip was observed in one in four patients after any index fracture and in one in three patients with an index hip fracture, on average within 1.5 years. Index hip fracture was associated with high mortality and post-surgery complication rates and healthcare costs relative to other fractures.

After lifting the societal restriction, the activity showed a tendency towards only partial normalisation. The median decline of the 43 weeks following the first 9 weeks of 2020 in the hospitals catchment area corresponded to 18.2%.. (Figure Presented) Dividing the curative BC referrals into two subgroups: a) local-only RT or b) loco-regional RT showed that the decline in referrals where mainly driven by the first group. Median monthly referrals dropped from 34 to 24 and from 20 to 18 respectively with declines of 29.4% and 10.0%. Monthly referrals in both subgroups where found to correlate with the total number of referrals before the lockdown (Pearson Correlation Coefficient C both with p<0.001), while only the first subgroup correlated after the lockdown (p<0.001 and p0.065 respectively). Conclusion: Although no acute nor life-threatening activities in the Danish Healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic have been closed nor reduced in activity, significant declines in patients diagnosed with cancer have been reported. Analysis of local referrals for one radiotherapy centre for curative RT for BC supports this, with a suggested decline of around 20% cumulative for the 11 months period following the COVID-19 pandemic onset in Denmark. Further analysis suggests that this decline was mainly driven by the subgroup of patients referred for local-only RT of the conserved breast. This might indicate that patient behaviour during the societal restriction have had unintended effects in early diagnosis of BC by voluntarily participations in national mammography screening program.","output":"PO-1451 Unintentional effects of societal restrictions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on referral for RT B.

Demographic data on age-specific mortality are used to estimate life expectancy, and validated data on exceptional life spans are used to study the maximum length of life. In the countries doing best each year, life expectancy started to increase around 1840 at a pace of almost 2.5 y per decade. This trend has continued until the present. Contrary to classical evolutionary theories of senescence and contrary to the predictions of many experts, the frontier of survival is advancing to higher ages. Furthermore, individual life spans are becoming more equal, reducing inequalities, with octogenarians and nonagenarians accounting for most deaths in countries with the highest life expectancy. If the current pace of progress in life expectancy continues, most children born this millennium will celebrate their 100th birthday. Considerable uncertainty, however, clouds forecasts: Life expectancy and maximum life span might increase very little if at all, or longevity might rise much faster than in the past. Substantial progress has been made over the past three decades in deepening understanding of how long humans have lived and how long they might live. The social, economic, health, cultural, and political consequences of further increases in longevity are so significant that the development of more powerful methods of forecasting is a priority.","output":"Demographic perspectives on the rise of longevity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For this 2020 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations, the Education, Implementation, and Teams Task Force applied the population, intervention, comparator, outcome, study design, time frame format and performed 15 systematic reviews, applying the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidance.

This research proposes real-time AI platform for people detection, and social distancing classification of individuals based on thermal camera. YOLOv4-tiny is proposed in this research for object detection. It is a simple neural network architecture, which makes it suitable for low-cost embedded devices. The proposed model is a better option compared to other approaches for real-time detection. An algorithm is also implemented to monitor social distancing using a birds-eye perspective. The proposed approach is applied to videos acquired through thermal cameras for people detection, social distancing classification, and at the same time measuring the skin temperature for the individuals. To tune up the proposed model for individual detection, the training stage is carried out by thermal images with various indoor and outdoor environments. The final prototype algorithm has been deployed in a low-cost Nvidia Jetson devices (Xavier and Jetson Nano) which are composed of fixed camera. The proposed approach is suitable for a surveillance system within sustainable smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature measurement.

For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, antiviral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS Sera (n = 533) from patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 94 with acute infections and n = 59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS High-sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease.

Data on colorectal EMR training are limited. We aimed to evaluate the en bloc EMR rate of polyps  20 mm among advanced endoscopy trainees and to identify predictors of failed en bloc EMR. Methods This was a multicenter prospective study evaluating trainee performance in EMR during advanced endoscopy fellowship. A logistic regression model was used to identify the number of procedures and lesion cut-off size associated with an en bloc EMR rate of  80 %. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of failed en bloc EMR. Results Six trainees from six centers performed 189 colorectal EMRs, of which 104 (55 %) were for polyps  20 mm. Of these, 57.7 % (60/104) were resected en bloc. Trainees with  30 EMRs (OR 6.80; 95 % CI: 2.80-16.50; P = 0.00001) and lesions  17 mm (OR 4.56;95 CI:1.23-16.88; P = 0.02) were more likely to be associated with an en bloc EMR rate of  80 %. Independent predictors of failed en bloc EMR on multivariate analysis included: larger polyp size (OR:6.83;95 % CI:2.55-18.4; P = 0.0001), right colon location (OR:7.15; 95 % CI:1.31-38.9; P = 0.02), increased procedural difficulty (OR 2.99; 95 % CI:1.13-7.91; P = 0.03), and having performed < 30 EMRs (OR: 4.87; 95 %CI: 1.05-22.61; P = 0.04). Conclusions In this pilot study, we demonstrated that a relatively low proportion of trainees achieved en bloc EMR for polyps  20 mm and identified procedure volume and lesion size thresholds for successful en bloc EMR and independent predictors for failed en bloc resection.

Therefore, we aimed to examine how environmental parameters change the body physiology in a hot environment during the coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study extracted from the MEDIC Japan heatstroke prevention database, which was recorded between 1 August and 7 September, 2020. Its database is a registry collection from seven healthy health\\\\care providers. Subjects recorded their own vital signs (forehead and tympanic temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation) and environmental factors (type of weather, wet\\\\bulb globe temperature [WBGT], air temperature, humidity, and location) every hour during their working shift. RESULTS: From 323 records, a weak positive but statistically significant correlation was observed between WBGT and pulse rate (correlation coefficient [95% confidence interval], r = 0.34 [0.23, 0.45]) and between WBGT and core body temperature. Forehead temperature had a stronger correlation than tympanic temperature (forehead, r = 0.33 [0.21, 0.43]; tympanic, r = 0.17 [0.05, 0.28]), which also showed a larger effect (forehead, (2) = 0.08; tympanic, (2) = 0.05). The effect size of oxygen saturation measured outdoors was large ((2) = 0.30). Forehead temperature increased abruptly at 28C WBGT and at 33C air temperature. CONCLUSION: A hot environment significantly affected forehead temperature, and the daytime imposed a high risk of heatstroke. To avoid heatstroke, environmental parameters are important to note as outdoor environments had a large effect on vital sign changes depending on the time of day.","output":"Evaluation of the physiological changes in prehospital health\\\\care providers influenced by environmental factors in the summer of 2020 during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate what factors need consideration for telehealth services for cancer supportive care, given the rapid transition to telehealth as a result of COVID-19.

Epidemiologic and molecular evidence suggests a superspreading event with a non-variant of concern (non-VOC) SARS CoV-2 strain at the root of the first outbreak. The second outbreak involved two childcare facilities experiencing infection activity with the variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (Alpha). We show that the index cases in all outbreaks had been childcare workers, and that children contributed substantially to secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from childcare facilities to households. The frequency of secondary transmissions in households originating from B.1.1.7-infected children was increased compared to children with non-VOC infections. Self-reported symptoms, particularly cough and rhinitis, occurred more frequently in B.1.1.7-infected children.

Heat-sensitive moxibustion was operated according to the required standard, 40 min to 60 min each time, once daily. Before and after moxibustion, the improvements in clinical symptoms were evaluated, such as chest oppression, poor appetite, lassitude and negative emotions. Results (1) The number of cases and the incidence was 21 cases (50.0%), 24 cases (57.1%) and 26 cases (61.9%) for chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude before heat-sensitive moxibustion. The number of cases was reduced to be 10 cases (23.8%), 7 cases (16.7%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 1st treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion for chest oppression, poor appetite, and lassitude. It was reduced to be 11 cases (26.2%), 8 cases (19.0%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 2nd treatment of moxibustion and it was reduced to be 18 cases (42.9%), 10 cases (23.8%) and 6 cases (14.3%) after the 3rd treatment of moxibustion. The incidences of the symptoms were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (2) Before treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion, there were 24 cases of negative emotions (57.1%). It was reduced to be 16 cases (38.1%), 11 cases (26.2%) and 3 cases (7.1%) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion successively.

FINDINGS: Telemedicine has demonstrated its advantages during the COVID-19 epidemic and can provide diversified clinical care services for patients with chronic diseases; these services have played a vital role in epidemic prevention and control, greatly alleviated the shortage of medical resources, increased the utilization level of medical resources, and reduced the cross-infection risk during treatment in hospitals. Furthermore, the epidemic situation presents opportunities for the development of diagnosis and treatment methods via the internet and active health management modalities.","output":"Telemedicine maybe an effective solution for management of chronic disease during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections have been associated with altered host defense and increased susceptibility to secondary infection. In previous experiments, we observed impaired migratory and chemotactic activity of neutrophils harvested from mice during sublethal murine CMV (MCMV) infection. To investigate further the effects of CMV infection upon phagocytic leukocytes, we incubated murine leukocyte suspensions (95% neutrophils) in vitro with MCMV derived either from tissue culture passage or salivary gland homogenate. Neutrophils incubated with salivary gland MCMV had depressed chemotactic activity at 2 and 4 h. For example, at 4 h the mean chemotactic index of neutrophils incubated with MCMV was 0.92 vs 2.56 in controls (p<0.01). Phagocytic activity at 4 h was also reduced (mean of 1.53 latex particles/cell in MCMV-incubated vs 2.39 in controls, p<0.01). In contrast, tissue culture-passed MCMV did not alter leukocyte function. Adherence of MCMV to phagocytic leukocytes was comparable to adherence of virus to mouse embryo fibroblast cells (2 to 3 log plaque forming units of MCMV/10(6) cells). Transmission electron microscopy at 4 h demonstrated occasional intracytoplasmic virions. These results indicate that impaired chemotactic and phagocytic activity of phagocytic leukocytes occurs after in vitro incubation with salivary gland-derived MCMV but not with tissue culture-passed virus. These differences may be attributable to altered virulence of MCMV or to the presence of soluble factors in salivary gland MCMV pools","output":"MURINE CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION OF PHAGOCYTIC LEUKOCYTES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The PD-1 pathway regulates dysfunctional T cells in chronic infection and cancer, but the role of this pathway during acute infection remains less clear. Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8+ T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of CD8+ T cell signals that promotes CD8+ T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 continues to fine-tune CD8+ T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in patients.","output":"The PD-1 Pathway Regulates Development and Function of Memory CD8+ T Cells following Respiratory Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the Preventive and Mandatory Social Isolation, because of COVID-19, the temples had to dose their doors and many priests began to celebrate masses online and, with them, the practice of \\"spiritual communion\\" reappeared In this text we propose to briefly review this category to replace it with another more present in the early Church and in the first Christians: \\"the sacrament of desire\\" The explanation will be from documents of the Magisterium of the Church, especially conciliar, valuing both texts and contexts, which allow us to delve into history and experience rather than in rigid formulations","output":"The Sacrament of Desire.

This study explores the ability of (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy to depict RCC and to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor. METHODS The ability to depict RCC with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy was tested in 14 patients scheduled to undergo a tumor nephrectomy; of these, 9 RCC patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice a day). In the latter group, baseline and posttreatment (111)In-bevacizumab scans were compared. The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-bevacizumab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of VEGF-A, glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase IX, -smooth-muscle actin, and Ki67 was determined by immunohistochemistry and compared with the local concentration of (111)In-bevacizumab. Additionally, the VEGF-A content in tumor samples was determined quantitatively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS In all 5 non-neoadjuvant-treated patients, preferential accumulation of (111)In-bevacizumab was observed in the tumors. All ccRCC lesions with enhanced (111)In-bevacizumab targeting expressed high levels of VEGF-A. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in the tumor in the patients with ccRCC (mean change, -60.5%; range, +1.5% to -90.1%). The decrease in uptake was due to destruction of the tumor neovasculature, whereas the VEGF-A expression remained intact. In the patient with papillary RCC, limited uptake without change after sorafenib was observed. CONCLUSION RCC lesions were clearly delineated with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy. Neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in RCC. (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy can be an attractive biomarker for response and needs further study.","output":"111In-bevacizumab imaging of renal cell cancer and evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor sorafenib."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Special Issue exploring the role of pharmacists in palliative and end of life care, we sought articles that would shed light on the ways in which pharmacists could impact end of life care [...].","output":"Preface: The Role of Pharmacists in Palliative and End of Life Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lessons from arthritis and cell therapy in cancer patients point to therapy for severe disease.","output":"Cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed healthcare systems. The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions. Materials and Methods: Using real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions. Results: 162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with [] 2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels. Discussion: Physical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff. Conclusion: Simulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.","output":"Staffing and Capacity Planning for SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Facilities: A Performance Estimation Calculator based on Discrete-Event Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A contra-classical logic is a logic that, over the same language as that of classical logic, validates arguments that are not classically valid.

Amid reported health and mental health disparities, and economic insecurity, we conducted a scoping review to explore the breadth of the literature, map and summarize the evidence, and identify knowledge gaps on LGBT+ inclusion and human rights in Thailand. METHODS We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We systematically searched 16 databases for peer-reviewed literature, and government and nongovernmental organization websites for grey literature, published in English or Thai from January 1, 2000-August 21, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened studies according to pre-set criteria. We abstracted and analyzed data on publication characteristics and focal populations, and synthesized findings in six domains of LGBT+ inclusion: political and civic participation, education, family, personal security and violence, economic well-being, and health. RESULTS The review captured 3327 results in total, which was scoped to 76 peer-reviewed articles and 39 grey literature sources, the majority published after 2010. Gay men and transgender women were the primary focal populations in the peer-reviewed literature, LGBT+ people as a whole in the grey literature. Health was the predominant domain across publications. Key findings include the absence of generalized antidiscrimination legislation for LGBT+ individuals and lack of recourse for transgender individuals to change their legal gender; multifaceted stigma and discrimination in the educational system; social isolation and exclusion in families; disproportionate prevalence of sexual violence and reluctance to report to police; discrimination and marginalization in employment; and LGBT+ disparities in health and mental health. CONCLUSIONS Future research and programmatic initiatives on LGBT+ inclusion in Thailand should aim to address: 1) understudied populations-lesbian and bisexual women, transmasculine persons; 2) underrepresented topics, including constraints to LGBT+ advocacy; 3) strategic policy initiatives around anti-discrimination laws and legal recognition of same-sex marriage and families; and 4) the need for consistent collection of disaggregated data on LGBT+ persons in education, family, economic, personal security/violence, and health domains in order to assess indicators of inclusion and progress in advancing human rights for LGBT+ people in Thailand.","output":"LGBT+ inclusion and human rights in Thailand: a scoping review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four billion people worldwide have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confinement.

This systematic review aims to identify (i) the social consequences of mass quarantinecommunity-wide movement restrictionsduring previous and current infectious disease outbreaks and (ii) recommended strategies to mitigate the negative social implications of COVID-19 lockdowns. Considering social determinants of health, we conducted a systematic review by searching five databases (Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database) for publications from inception to 9 April 2020. No limitation was set on language, location or study type. Studies that (i) contained peer-reviewed original empirical evidence and (ii) focussed on non-epidemiological implications of mass quarantine were included. We thematically synthesized and reported data due to heterogeneous disease and country context. Of 3067 publications found, 15 original peer-reviewed articles were selected for full-text extraction. Psychological distress, heightened communication inequalities, food insecurity, economic challenges, diminished access to health care, alternative delivery of education and gender-based violence were identified as negative social consequences of community-based quarantine in six infectious disease epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, altruistic attitudes were identified as a positive consequence during previous quarantines. Diverse psychological and social consequences of mass quarantine in previous and current epidemics were evident, but individual country policies had been highly varied in how well they addressed the needs of affected individuals, especially those who are socially marginalized. Policymakers should balance the pros and cons of movement restrictions, facilitate multisectoral action to tackle social inequalities, provide clear and coherent guidance to the public and undertake time-bound policy evaluations to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and to establish preparedness strategies for future epidemics.","output":"Social consequences of mass quarantine during epidemics: a systematic review with implications for the COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Superficial temporal artery (STA) pseudoaneurysm is a very rare occurrence that usually presents as a pulsatile mass along the STA distribution following trauma or an iatrogenic cause.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Professional societies provided ad-hoc guidance at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic on deferral of surgical and perioperative interventions, but these lack specific parameters to determine the optimal timing of surgery. METHODS: Using the GRADE system, published evidence was analyzed to generate weighted statements for stage, site, acuity of presentation, and hospital setting to specify when surgery should be pursued, the time and duration of oncologically acceptable delays, and when to utilize nonsurgical modalities to bridge the waiting period. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer surgeries-prioritized as emergency, urgent with imminent emergency or oncologically urgent, or elective-were matched against the phases of the pandemic. Surgery in COVID-19-positive patients must be avoided. Emergent and imminent emergent cases should mostly proceed unless resources are exhausted. Standard practices allow for postponement of elective cases and deferral to nonsurgical modalities of stage II/III rectal and metastatic colorectal cancer. Oncologically urgent cases may be delayed for 6(-12) weeks without jeopardizing oncological outcomes. Outside established principles, administration of nonsurgical modalities is not justified and increases the vulnerability of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed already limited health care resources and forced rationing, triage, and prioritization of care in general, specifically of surgical interventions.

Seven-day Consultant presence and morning AMU discharges have been advocated to improve hospital bed management. AIMS: To determine whether a later time of daily peak AMU occupancy correlates with measures of hospital stress; whether seven-day Consultant presence, for COVID-19, abolished weekly periodicity of discharges. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis METHODS: Anonymised AMU admission and discharge times were retrieved from the Profile Information Management System (PIMS), at a large, urban hospital from 14(th) April 201431(st) December 2018 and 20(th) March2(nd) May 2020 (COVID-19 peak). Minute-by-minute admission and discharge times were combined to construct a running total of AMU bed occupancy. Fourier transforms were used to determine periodicity. We tested association between i) average AMU occupancy and ii) time of peak AMU occupancy, with measures of hospital stress (total medical bed occupancy and medical outliers on non-medical wards). RESULTS: Daily, weekly and seasonal patterns of AMU bed occupancy were evident. Timing of AMU peak occupancy was unrelated to each measure of hospital stress: total medical inpatients (Spearmans rho, r(s)=0.04, P = 0.24); number of medical outliers (r(s)=-0.06, P = 0.05). During COVID-19, daily bed occupancy was similar, with continuation of greater Friday and Monday discharges than the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: Timing of peak AMU occupancy did not alter with hospital stress. Efforts to increase morning AMU discharges are likely to have little effect on hospital performance.

Ameloblastoma is a frequently encountered tumor of the maxillofacial area. An extensive lesion might occupy the floor of the mouth, prevent displacement of the tongue, limiting the space for inserting a laryngoscope blade and resulting in difficult intubation even with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Case presentation A 66-year-old man (67 kg; 171 cm) with a mental swelling was diagnosed with ameloblastoma and scheduled for surgical resection. The tumor was extensive, occupying most of the anterior floor of the mouth. We were concerned about impossible direct laryngoscopy because the massive tumor in the floor of the mouth compressed the base of the tongue against the posterior wall of the pharynx, restricting the space for inserting the laryngoscope blade. Therefore, we planned to perform awake nasal fiberoptic intubation to secure the airway. Although the procedure was complicated by the massive tumor, successful intubation was achieved by hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the endotracheal tube (ETT) under direct laryngoscopy. Discussion Awake fiberoptic intubation was complicated by the tumor protrusion to deviate the ETT. Discovering of the ETT deviation by the insufficient blade insertion facilitated visualizing the vocal cords with the fiberoptic scope. Conclusion Identification of ETT deviation even with insufficient blade insertion and hand-assisted alteration of the direction of the ETT might raise the chances of successful fiberoptic intubation.

In this multicenter prospective cohort study, HCWs from frontline departments were included in March and April 2020 and followed for 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed at month 0 (M0), M1, and M3 and RT-PCR in case of symptoms. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3. Risk factors of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 were identified by multivariate logistic regression. Among 1062 HCWs (median [interquartile range] age, 33 [28C42] years; 758 [71.4%] women; 321 [30.2%] physicians), the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3 was 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] [12.5; 16.9]). Risk factors were the working department specialty, with increased risk for intensive care units (odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI [0.38; 8.58]), emergency departments (3.91 [0.83; 18.43]) and infectious diseases departments (4.22 [0.92; 18.28]); current smoking was associated with reduced risk (0.36 [0.21; 0.63]). Age, sex, professional category, number of years of experience in the job or department, and public transportation use were not significantly associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at M3.

We aimed to evaluate risk factors associated with AKI beyond COVID-19 severity. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between risk factors and AKI (based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). Dominance analysis was performed to evaluate the relative importance of individual factors. RESULTS: Seven hundred seven patients were included. Median age was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 29C57) and 57% were male with few comorbidities (93%, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] <1). AKI occurred in 57 patients (8.1%); 39 were in AKI stage 1 (68%), 9 in stage 2 (16%), and 9 in stage 3 (16%). Older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01C1.07), baseline use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (aOR 2.86; 95% CI: 1.20C6.83), exposure to vancomycin (aOR 5.84; 95% CI: 2.10C16.19), use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aOR 3.04; 95% CI: 1.15C8.05), and severe COVID-19 with hypoxia (aOR 13.94; 95% CI: 6.07C31.98) were associated with AKI in the multivariable logistic regression model. The 3 highest ranked predictors were severe COVID-19 with hypoxia, vancomycin exposure, and age, accounting for 79.6% of the predicted variance (41.6, 23.1, and 14.9%, respectively) on dominance analysis. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 is independently associated with increased risk of AKI beyond premorbid conditions and age. Appropriate avoidance of vancomycin and NSAIDs are potentially modifiable means to prevent AKI in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Risk Factors for Development of Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the onset of COVID-19 restrictions and the slow relaxing of many restrictions, it is imperative that we understand what this means for the performance of the transport network.

Tranexamic acid does not result in a complete shutdown of the fibrinolysis, supporting its safe use without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications. ABSTRACT: Background: An endoprosthetic reconstruction in musculoskeletal oncology patients is associated with significant blood loss. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) for these patients and to assess any changes in their hemostatic profile using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed including 61 patients with primary or metastatic bone tumors who underwent surgery. Group A (n = 30) received both intravenous and local TXA whereas Group B (n = 31) was the control group. The primary outcomes were perioperative blood loss and blood unit transfusions and the secondary outcomes included the incidence of thromboembolic complications and a change in blood coagulability as reflected by ROTEM parameters. Results: The median difference in blood loss between the two groups was 548.5 mL, indicating a 29.2% reduction in the 72 h blood loss following TXA administration (p < 0.001). TXA also led to a reduced transfusion of 1 red blood cell (RBC) unit per patient (p < 0.001). The two groups had similar rates of thromboembolic complications (p = 0.99). The antifibrinolytic properties of TXA were confirmed by the significantly higher INTEM, FIBTEM and EXTEM LI60 (p < 0.001, p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) values in the TXA group. Conclusion: Tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements without a complete shutdown of the fibrinolysis. Larger studies are warranted to assess the frequency of these outcomes in musculoskeletal oncology patients.","output":"The Safety and Efficacy of Tranexamic Acid in Oncology Patients Undergoing Endoprosthetic Reconstruction and a ROTEM-Based Evaluation of Their Hemostatic Profile: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify critical elements of return to learn (RTL) for students with concussion and examine the state of the peer-reviewed published literature through a scoping review.

Objective: To examine the association between clinical characteristics and levels of NAbs in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a total of 175 patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 24 to February 26, 2020, were followed up until March 16, 2020, at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infections were diagnosed and confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers. Secondary outcomes included spike-binding antibodies, cross-reactivity against SARS-associated CoV, kinetics of NAb development, and clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration, length of stay, lymphocyte counts, and blood C-reactive protein level. Results: Of the 175 patients with COVID-19, 93 were female (53%); the median age was 50 (interquartile range [IQR], 37-63) years. The median length of hospital stay was 16 (IQR, 13-21) days, and the median disease duration was 22 (IQR, 18-26) days. Variable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were observed at the time of discharge (50% inhibitory dose [ID50], 1076 [IQR, 448-2048]). There were 10 patients whose NAb titers were less than the detectable level of the assay (ID50, <40), and 2 patients who showed very high titers of NAbs, with ID50 levels of 15 989 and 21 567. NAbs were detected in patients from day 4 to 6 and reached peak levels from day 10 to 15 after disease onset. NAbs were unable to cross-react with SARS-associated CoV and NAb titers correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1 (r = 0.451; 95% CI, 0.320-0.564; P < .001), receptor binding domain (r = 0.484; 95% CI, 0.358-0.592; P < .001), and S2 regions (r = 0.346; 95% CI, 0.204-0.473; P < .001).

The design of multivalent virus binding inhibitors is complex as many properties, such as inhibitor size and functionalization with virus attachment factors, have a strong impact on the inhibition efficiency. In this study, we synthesized virus binding inhibitors, the design of which has been inspired by mucins, which are naturally occurring glycosylated proteins with molecular weights in the MDa range and which show high affinity in the interaction with various viruses. Hyperbranched polyglycerols (hPG), serving as polymeric scaffolds, were functionalized with sialic acids and sulfate groups at degrees of functionalization as suggested from the structure of mucins. The molecular weights of the hPG-based inhibitors ranged between 10 and 2600 kDa, thereby hitting the size of mucins (MDa scale) and allowing for comparing the inhibition efficiency of the largest, mucin-sized inhibitor (2600 kDa) with related inhibitors of lower molecular weight. Inhibition efficiencies were determined by various methods based on the inhibition of influenza A virus (IAV) binding to lipid membranes, including an assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy that allows for probing the interaction of IAV with its native attachment factor, sialic acid. Potent inhibition is observed in all assays already at pM concentrations for the mucin-sized inhibitor, while decreasing the inhibitor's molecular weight also decreased its inhibition efficiency. In addition, a biphasic binding behavior of the inhibitors to IAV is observed, which is attributed to differences in the binding affinity to two IAV envelope proteins, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin.","output":"Mucin-inspired, high molecular weight virus binding inhibitors show biphasic binding behavior to influenza A viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors assert that art-based inquiry can serve as a powerful medium for understanding the connection between faith and resilience as perceived and understood by older African-Americans adults disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic Utilizing the CRT method of counterstorytelling as our conduit to elucidate our culturally situated responses to the COVID-19 pandemic We seek to explore the connections between faith and resilience in social work practice during this public health crisis Drawing from our shared experiences as two Black social workers we discuss the role spirituality plays in mitigating loneliness and stress among socially isolated older African-American adults (i e , social distancing) Finally, with physical contact limited (i e , social distancing) because of COVID-19, implications and recommendations for using spiritual-based practices with older African-American adults and families are discussed","output":"\\"There is a Balm in Gilead\\": Black Social Workers' Spiritual Counterstory on the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Risk factors associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are unknown.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with MS and COVID-19 and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Covisep registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in MS expert centers and general hospitals and with neurologists collaborating with MS expert centers and members of the Socit Francophone de la Sclrose en Plaques. The study included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 diagnosed with a polymerase chain reaction test on a nasopharyngeal swab, thoracic computed tomography, or typical symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results: A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS &#8805;6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity).

An individuals autonomy can be impaired and their control over their social identity diminished, even without infringing the anonymity surrounding their personal identity. A century-old individualistic conception of privacy that aimed at safeguarding a person from unwarranted social interference is incapable of protecting their autonomy and identity when they are targeted on the basis of their interdependent social and algorithmic group affiliations. In order to overcome these limitations, in this article, I develop a theoretical framework in the form of a triumvirate model of the group right to privacy (GRP), which is based on privacy as a social value (Pv). An individual has an interest in protecting their social identity arising out of their participation in social groups. The panoptic sorting of individuals by Big Data Analytics for behavioral targeting purposes gives rise to epistemic bubbles and echo chambers that impede the formation of an individuals social identity. I construct the formulation of GRP1 to protect an individuals interest in their social identity and their socially embedded autonomous self. Thereafter, I emphasize an individuals right to informational self-determination and against algorithmic grouping in GRP2. Lastly, I highlight instances where GRP3 entitles an organized group to privacy in its own right. I develop a Razian formulation to state that Big Data Analytics constant surveillance and monetization of human existence is an infringement of individual autonomy. The violation of GRP subjects an individual to behavioral targeting (including hyper-targeted political advertising) and distorts their weltanschauung, or worldview. As regards COVID-19 Apps, I assert that the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the pandemic do not provide an everlasting justification for reducing an individuals identity to a potential disease carrier. I argue that the ambivalence regarding existence of surveillance surrounding an individuals social identity can leave them in a perpetual state of simulated surveillance (simveillance). I further assert that it is in the long-term best interests of the Big Tech corporations to respect privacy. In conclusion, I highlight that our privacy is not only interdependent in nature, but it is also existentially cumulatively interlinked. It increases in force with each successive protection. The privacy challenge posed by COVID-19 Apps has helped us realize that while limited exceptions to privacy may be carved out in grave emergencies, there is no moral justification for round-the-clock surveillance of an individuals existence by Big Data Analytics. Similarly, the threat to privacy posed by Big Data Analytics has helped us realize that privacy has been wrongly focusing on the distinguishing aspects of the individual. It is our similarities that are truly worth protecting. In order to protect these similarities, I formulate the concept of mutual or companion privacy, which counterintuitively states that in the age of Big Data Analytics, we have more privacy together rather than individually.","output":"A Theory of Group Privacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel respiratory coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China, causing the disease termed COVID-19 that has caused millions of infections worldwide.

This baculovirus expression system has many advantages for the synthesis of viral structural proteins resulting in the formation of VLPs. It allows production of large amounts of correctly folded proteins while also providing cell membranes that can serve as structural elements for enveloped viruses. These features give us the opportunity to gain insights into the interactions and requirements accompanying VLP formation that are similar to the assembly events occurring in mammalian cells. Other encouraging elements are the ability to easily scale up the system and the simplicity of purification of the assembled VLPs. The growing number of VLPs carrying foreign protein fragments on their surface and studies on the successful assembly of these chimeric molecules is a promising avenue towards the development of a new technology, in which the newly designed VLPs will be directed to particular mammalian cell types by exposing specific binding domains. The progress made in modeling the surface of VLPs makes them to date the best candidates for the design of delivery systems that can efficiently reach their targets.","output":"Virus\\\\Like Particles: Models for Assembly Studies and Foreign Epitope Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has rarely been associated with immune-mediated phenomena such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA).

We show that cholesterol depletion by treatment with methyl--cyclodextrin (mCD) affects infection by SARS-CoV to the same extent as infection by vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes containing the surface glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV (VSV-G-S). Therefore, the role of cholesterol for SARS-CoV infection can be assigned to the S protein and is unaffected by other coronavirus proteins. There have been contradictory reports whether or not angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, is present in detergent-resistant membrane domains. We found that ACE2 of both Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells co-purifies with marker proteins of detergent-resistant membranes supporting the notion that cholesterol-rich microdomains provide a platform facilitating the efficient interaction of the S protein with the cellular receptor ACE2. To understand the involvement of cholesterol in the initial steps of the viral life cycle, we applied a cell-based binding assay with cells expressing the S protein and cells containing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Alternatively, we used a soluble S protein as interaction partner. Depletion of cholesterol from the ACE2-expressing cells reduced the binding of S-expressing cells by 50% whereas the binding of soluble S protein was not affected. This result suggests that optimal infection requires a multivalent interaction between viral attachment protein and cellular receptors.","output":"Importance of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the interaction of the S protein of SARS-coronavirus with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NHS cancer services should be ring-fenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, recommends Macmillan Cancer Support, which could mean that cancer nurse specialists would not be redeployed","output":"Call for ring-fencing of cancer services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine Translation (MT) has the potential to help people overcome language barriers and is widely used in high-stakes scenarios, such as in hospitals.

Collective aeromedical evacuations (MEDEVACS) might help rebalance the demand and supply of health care. If interhospital transport of patients suffering from ARDS is relatively common, little is known about the specific challenges of collective medevac. Oxygen management in such context is crucial. We describe our experience with a focus on this resource. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the first six collective medevac performed during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic by the French Military Health Service from March 17 to April 3, 2020. Oxygen management was compliant with international guidelines as well as aeronautical constraints and monitored throughout the flights. Presumed high O2 consumers were scheduled to board the last and disembark the first. RESULTS: Thirty-six mechanically ventilated patients were successfully transported within Europe. The duration of onboard ventilation was 185 minutes (145-198.5 minutes), including the flight, the boarding and disembarking periods. Oxygen intake was 1,650 L per patient per flight (1,350-1,950 L patient per flight) and 564 L per patient per hour (482-675 L per patient-1 per hour) and surpassed our anticipation. As anticipated, presumed high O2 consumers had a reduced ventilation duration onboard. The estimations of oxygen consumptions were frequently overshot, and only two hypoxemia episodes occurred.

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has recently been developed and seems equally effective while associated with fewer side-effects. Both require general anaesthesia, which could be quantified using the bispectral index (BIS). We compared ECT and MST with respect to recovery times, left-sided BIS, and left-right differences in BIS. METHODS In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 10 successive patients receiving ECT and 10 patients undergoing MST. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol and monitored with a bilateral BIS sensor. The seizure was elicited when the BIS was within a range from 50 to 60. The time to eye opening was measured and bilateral BIS were recorded for 10 min after seizure induction. RESULTS A comparable anaesthetic depth was observed in the ECT and MST groups at baseline [mean (standard deviation, sd) BIS values of 94.1 (4.1) and 95.5 (3.0), respectively] and before seizure induction [mean (sd) BIS values of 52.3 (9.6) and 55.2 (10.3), respectively]. Post-ictally, MST patients opened their eyes significantly earlier than ECT patients [3.0 (1.0) vs 6.7 (1.3) min, P<0.001]. They showed a significantly higher BIS at 2 min after seizure induction [69.2 (10.1) vs 50.9 (15.9), P=0.003], and this difference was still present at 10 min after seizure induction [BIS 81.5 (6.5) vs 68.0 (16.4), P<0.001]. Significant differences between the left and right BIS were observed in neither the ECT nor the MST group. CONCLUSIONS At a comparable anaesthetic depth, MST is superior to ECT in terms of post-ictal recovery, which is correctly reflected by higher post-ictal BIS values. Unilateral BIS monitoring is sufficient to monitor anaesthetic depth in ECT and MST patients.

Here we compared the epidemiological characteristics of laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19 in Wuhan. METHODS: Demographics, case severity and outcomes of 29,886 confirmed cases and 21,960 clinically diagnosed cases reported between December 2019 and February 24, 2020, were compared. The risk factors were estimated, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated. RESULTS: The age and occupation distribution of confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases were consistent, and their sex ratio were 1.0 and 0.9, respectively. The epidemic curve of clinical diagnosis cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and the city centers had more cumulative cases and higher incidence density than suburbs in both of two groups. The proportion of severe and critical cases (21.5 % vs. 14.0 %, P < 0.0001) and case fatality rates (5.2 % vs. 1.2 %, P < 0.0001) of confirmed cases were all higher than those of clinically diagnosed cases. Risk factors for death we observed in both of two groups were older age, male, severe or critical cases. Rt showed the same trend in two groups, it dropped below 1.0 on February 6 among confirmed cases, and February 8 among clinically diagnosed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic characteristics and spatiotemporal distributions of confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases are roughly similar, but the disease severity and clinical outcome of clinically diagnosed cases are better than those of confirmed cases.

Traditional methods of population-level disease surveillance do not capture household transmission. Data collected from smartphone-connected thermometers that can differentiate among individuals in a household can be used to study these characteristics. Using this technology, we estimated the household secondary attack rate (SAR) of febrile illness, assessed its correlation with CDC-reported influenza-like illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case incidence, and identified risk factors for secondary transmission. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 596,096 febrile illness index cases recorded from August 1, 2016 to January 20, 2021 in households with two or more individuals in all 50 states. Fevers were measured using the Kinsa Smart Thermometer and mobile device app. Secondary cases were defined as household members who recorded a fever 1C10 days after an index case. We calculated SAR prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic within the study period, and assessed correlation to ILI and COVID-19 case incidence using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient. Bivariate and multivariable mixed logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. Results SAR in the pre-COVID-19 period was 5.9% (95% CI: 5.8%C6.0%) during flu season (November to April), and 3.7% (95% CI: 3.6%C3.7%) in flu off-season, and weekly SAR was significantly correlated with ILI reported from CDC (=0.84, p< 0.001). Secondary transmission was 40% more likely to occur in households where the index cases initial temperature was  39.1C. During the COVID-19 period, SAR was 3.3% (95% CI: 3.3%C3.4%), and daily SAR was significantly correlated with national daily COVID-19 incidence rates (=0.86, p< 0.001). Households in census tracts with >50% essential workforce were 50% more likely to experience secondary transmission. Conclusion Household SAR was highly correlated with ILI and COVID-19 cases. Capturing household transmission of febrile illness through routine public health surveillance may identify risk factors for infectious disease transmission, allowing for more targeted interventions.

A case-control design was utilized and previously published criteria for PJI were included to distinguish between cases and control subjects with/without TJA. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the genes for interleukin-1beta (SNP: IL1B-511, +3962), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-308, -238) and interleukin-6 (IL6-174, nt565) were genotyped in 303 Caucasian (Czech) patients with TJA (89 with PJI / 214 without PJI), and 168 unrelated healthy Czech individuals without TJA.

Diagnosis of severe postvaccination acute eosinophilic pneumonia was retained given the history of allergy, lack of improvement on antibiotics, elimination of all other probable causes of eosinophilia, and improvement on corticosteroids. Such reactions of eosinophilic pneumonia have only been described twice: once following vaccination with the influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip*) and the other after vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax 23*). Hypereosinophilia must be taken into consideration, feared, and prevented. Although rare and severe, post-COVID-19 vaccination acute eosinophilic pneumonia remains well manageable with corticosteroids with a good outcome. Therefore, in some poorly monitored patients with allergy or asthma, the use of another less allergenic vaccine could be considered to avoid such reactions.","output":"Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia Associated With the Anti-COVID-19 Vaccine AZD1222"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT There have been many laboratory-based investigations since the emergence of the novel coronaviruses in the autumn of 2012, but most of the parameters required for establishing scientifically the control measures that will protect against them have yet to be determined.

Our hospital successfully restarted elective orthopaedic surgery during the pandemic to help improve the quality of life of patients with chronic disabilities. This study describes the development of local protocols and pathways to allow for a safe restart of elective orthopaedic surgery in a COVID-19-free green site. It includes the morbidity and mortality outcomes of those patients who underwent non-emergency orthopaedic operations during this time. Methods This is a prospective cohort study over an eight-week period evaluating 104 patients undergoing non-emergency orthopaedic procedures through a COVID-19-free surgical pathway. The primary outcome measure was 14-day postoperative mortality. The main secondary outcome measures were the development of a COVID-19 infection in the hospital and 14 days postoperatively as well as the need for intensive care unit admissions. Results No patients developed a COVID-19 infection. There were no intensive care unit admissions or postoperative deaths during our study time frame. There was no statistical difference seen for age (< 70 or > 70), gender, body mass index, or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades in the development of postoperative complications. Conclusions This study describes a roadmap to setting up a protocolised elective operating service for orthopaedic surgery. It has shown that standardised protocols in a COVID-19-free green site, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and adherence to national guidelines on self-isolation can help prevent developing COVID-19 infection postoperatively and reduce the risk of postoperative mortality.","output":"Restarting Elective Orthopaedic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) may be obtained from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Although not FDA approved, preliminary data suggests patients who receive convalescent plasma from recovered donors may have shortened recovery time and symptom reduction. The purpose of the study is to detail learner recruitment of convalescent plasma donation (CPD) for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prisma Health Midlands formed a multidisciplinary CP donation team, consisting of seven COVID-19-certified pharmacy learner volunteers, two pharmacists, and two providers. Primary eligibility criteria were SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity at least 28 days prior to donation and asymptomatic for a minimum of 14 days. Donors were excluded based on FDA guidelines for CPD, limiting ineligible contact. Team learners were trained on call techniques and subsequently contacted, educated, and requested candidates donate through this program. Willing donors were then linked to The Blood Connection to circulate CP back into the Prisma Health System, creating a self-sustaining and closed-loop donation cycle. RESULTS: In total, 253 recovered adult patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results were evaluated. 195 patients met baseline inclusion criteria for contact. This pre-screen reduced call and travel time for ineligible candidates. 108 patients were successfully reached. Of the 108, n=79 (73.14%) accepted referral to The Blood Connection, and n=29 (26.85%) were no longer candidates primarily due to patient communicated new exclusionary factors, such as active COVID-19 symptoms. The program allowed for rapid, internal access to CP for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at Prisma Health Midlands. CONCLUSION: Interest and awareness in COVID-19 CPD was successfully increased upon direct communication from the team and was felt to represent a personnel intense but successful model for recruiting potential CP donors. This program educated and utilized learners during this pandemic to enhance Prisma Healths ability to obtain CP for hospitalized patients using a closed system.

Pulmonology OBJECTIVE: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests primarily as a lung infection, its involvement in acute kidney injury (AKI) is gaining recognition and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Concurrent infection, which may require administration of a potentially nephrotoxic agent, can worsen AKI and lead to poor outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus associated with nosocomial infections, especially in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Trimethoprim/sulfa-methoxazole combination (TMP/SMX) is considered the treatment of choice but can itself lead to AKI, posing a significant challenge in the management of patients with concomitant COVID-19 and S. maltophilia pneumonia. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and post renal transplant presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission. His renal functions were normal at the time of admission. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia requiring administration of TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX led to the development of AKI, which continued to worsen despite appropriate management including hemodialysis. This coincided with and most likely resulted in the patients clinical deterioration and ultimate death. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving and appears to be multifactorial. The condition can significantly worsen especially when nephrotoxic agents are given, probably due to a cumulative or synergistic effect. Great caution should be taken when administering nephrotoxic agents in the setting of COVID-19 as it can lead to adverse patient outcomes.","output":"Renal Transplant Recipient with Concurrent COVID-19 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Pneumonia Treated with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Leading to Acute Kidney Injury: A Therapeutic Dilemma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both urban planners and urban scholars have been keenly interested in identifying the characteristics associated with neighborhood satisfaction.

We found that a simple parent vs. non-parent dichotomy hides significant heterogeneity among these groups. Co-parents and not-yet-parents both experience distinctively high levels of neighborhood satisfaction, while single parents and childfree individuals experience significantly less neighborhood satisfaction. We also find that population density and COVID-related stress reduce the neighborhood satisfaction of each group in similar ways.

In the current era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is worth mentioning that the disease itself and several drugs used for its treatment have been associated with QTc prolongation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement and clinical precision of a portable single-lead ECG device to measure the QTc interval compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: In sequential tests, QTc of ECG recordings obtained with the device KardiaMobile (KM-1L) (AliveCor?) were compared to QTc obtained with conventional 12-lead ECG. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the Lin's concordance coefficient. Consistency between the two devices in determining QTc prolongation (QTc &#8805;470 ms in males, or &#8805;480 ms in females), was evaluated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: 128 patients with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to a University Hospital were included. QTc intervals measured with KM were similar to QTc measured with conventional ECG (442.4540.5 vs. 441.6540.3 ms, p:0.15). Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference in QTc values (average difference of -0.797, 95% Limits Of Agreement:-13.179;11.585). Lin's concordance coefficient showed an excellent agreement (0.988, p<0.001). Concordance between the two devices for determining QTc prolongation was excellent (Kappa>0.90). CONCLUSION: ECG recordings obtained with KM-1L allow an accurate QTc interval assessment. Considering its simplicity of use, this approach has advantages over conventional ECG and can provide an alternative for the evaluation of QTc in hospitalized patients, during the current time of pandemic by COVID-19 and beyond.","output":"PORTABLE SINGLE-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM DEVICE IS ACCURATE FOR QTc EVALUATION IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To evaluate the association between ventilator type and hospital mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2 infection) during the first wave of the disease in France. Methods: : We retrospectively included consecutive adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated tertiary hospital for ARDS related to proven COVID-19, between March and May 2020. All patients were intubated. We compared two patient groups defined by whether an ICU ventilator or a less sophisticated ventilator such as a transport ventilator was used. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted. Cox multivariate regression was performed to identify associations between patient characteristics and hospital mortality. Results: : We included 82 patients (61 [74.4%] men) with a median age of 64 years [55C74], of whom 23 (28.1%) died before hospital discharge. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were older age (HR, 1.06/year;95%CI, 1.00C1.11;P =0.05) and diabetes mellitus (HR, 3.32;95%CI, 1.13C9.76;P =0.03) but not ventilator type. Using non-ICU ventilator was associated neither with a longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (20 [12-36] vs. 25 [15-31] days;P =0.87) nor with a longer ICU stay (24 [14-40] vs. 27 [15-37] days;P =0.64). Conclusions: : In patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, the use of non-ICU ventilators, such as transport ventilators, was not associated with worse outcomes. Although prospective data are needed to confirm our findings, this study suggests that transport ventilators may be valuable during COVID-19 surges that overwhelm ICU resources.","output":"Association of Ventilator Type with Hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients with SARS-CoV2 Infection: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-Covid-19 infection got spread in many countries and WHO declared it as a serious global Pandemic.

Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2/8 and 1/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct 25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","output":"Evaluation of NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome characterisation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the entrance of pollutants in different branches of the river network, it is essential to study contaminant transport at the river confluences. In the present study, it was attempted to investigate the conservative pollution transport at channel confluence by operating a series of experiments in the laboratory flume. In the designed laboratory model, two branches, with different widths of 45, 25 cm, were intersected and a channel confluence was created. Five entrance discharges and three initial contaminant concentrations, introduced using a linear feeder, were chosen as experimental variables. Conservative tracer of sodium chloride solution was used, and the electrical conductivities were measured at eight locations of the main channel and upstream branches with 2 seconds interval. Junction zone was assumed as a control volume, and by applying mass equilibrium to it, a new mathematical model was extracted. It was observed that there is concentration fluctuation in the falling limbs of the experimental breakthrough curves of the junction zone; however, it was diminished by downstream motion. Moreover, the observed pollution graphs had double peak points which changed to a single point with an increase of distance from the confluence position. Operation of the presented model was investigated by variation of its parameters. It was found that the contaminant residence time parameters of the confluence zone have the most significant influence in the simulation of the analytical model. Additionally, it was observed that the values of Gaussian distribution of the upstream branches could displace the position of pulses of resultant breakthrough curves or can overlap them.

A descriptive study was performed. A simple and anonymous questionnaire was created for parents of children between 0 and 3 years old who lived in Spain during the period of home confinement due to COVID-19 (March to June 2020). The measurement instrument used was a questionnaire made in Google Forms, where the variables were collected: Motor development (measured through the Ages & Stages Questionnaire, ASQ3), Quality of life (assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, PedsQL) and other variables, such as stimulation, performed during home confinement. Eighty-eight questionnaires were validated. The highest score in the motor development domains were obtained in children 2C3 years old.

Given these important roles, zinc has a sophisticated transport system to regulate its homeostasis. Determination of zinc status, however, is difficult to determine as serum levels are closely maintained and are not an accurate reflection of total body zinc or metabolism at the organ level. Fortunately, the discovery of zinc-specific fluorescent dyes has allowed for a much better assessment of zinc status in the respiratory system and has revealed that alcoholism perturbs this highly developed zinc metabolism such that its distribution to the lung and alveolar space is significantly decreased. As a result, this pulmonary zinc deficiency impairs function in the alveolar macrophage, which is the primary host immune cell within the lower airway. Experimental models have demonstrated that correction of this zinc deficiency restores immune function to the alveolar macrophage as best reflected by improved bacterial clearance in response to infection. While the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced zinc deficiency are still under investigation, there is experimental evidence of several important connections with granulocyteCmacrophage colony-stimulating factor and oxidative stress, suggesting that alteration of zinc homeostasis may be a fundamental mechanism underlying the cellular pathology seen in the alcohol lung phenotype. This chapter reviews zinc homeostasis and offers insight into our understanding of zinc deficiency in the setting of alcoholism and the potential of zinc as a therapeutic modality in the vulnerable alcoholic host.","output":"Alcohol-Mediated Zinc Deficiency Within the Alveolar Space: A Potential Fundamental Mechanism Underlying Oxidative Stress and Cellular Dysfunction in the Alcoholic Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have shown in a previous paper that the standard time-invariant SIR model was not effective to predict the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic propagation.

METHODS: 165 patients admitted from March 8th to April 17th, 2020, with COVID-19 in an acute geriatric ward in Italy were included. Pre-disease frailty was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Multimorbidity was defined as the co-occurrence of 2 of these in the same patient. The hazard (HR) of in-hospital mortality as a function of CFS score and number of chronic diseases in the whole population and in those aged 70+ years were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 165 patients, 112 were discharged, 11 were transferred to intensive care units and 42 died. Patients who died were older (81.0 vs. 65.2 years, p<0.001), more frequently multimorbid (97.6 vs. 52.8%; p<0.001) and more likely frail (37.5 vs. 4.1%; p<0.001). Less than 2.0% of patients without multimorbidity and frailty, 28% of those with multimorbidity only and 75% of those with both multimorbidity and frailty died. Each unitary increment in the CFS was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death in the whole sample (HR=1.3; 95%CI=1.05-1.62) and in patients aged 70+ years (HR=1.29;95%CI=1.04-1.62), whereas the number of chronic diseases was not significantly associated with higher risk of death. The CFS addition to age and sex increased mortality prediction by 9.4% in those aged 70+ years. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty identifies patients with COVID-19 at risk of in-hospital death independently of age. Multimorbidity contributes to prognosis because of the very low probability of death in its absence.","output":"Beyond chronological age: Frailty and multimorbidity predict in-hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) carries a high risk of infection and has spread rapidly around the world. However, there are limited data about the clinical symptoms globally. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify the prevalence of the clinical symptoms of patient with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, medRxiv, and Google Scholar, from December 1st, 2019 to January 1st, 2021. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I(2)) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 215 studies, involving 132,647 COVID-19 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of the four most common symptoms were fever 76.2% (n = 214; 95% CI 73.9C78.5); coughing 60.4% (n = 215; 95% CI 58.6C62.1); fatigue 33.6% (n = 175; 95% CI 31.2C36.1); and dyspnea 26.2% (n = 195; 95% CI 24.1C28.5). Other symptoms from highest to lowest in terms of prevalence include expectorant (22.2%), anorexia (21.6%), myalgias (17.5%), chills (15%), sore throat (14.1%), headache (11.7%), nausea or vomiting (8.7%), rhinorrhea (8.2%), and hemoptysis (3.3%). In subgroup analyses by continent, it was found that four symptoms have a slight prevalence variationfever, coughing, fatigue, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, coughing, fatigue, and dyspnea.

Clinical and histopathologic features of pernio are well described, but the pathogenesis is not entirely understood; vasospasm and a type I interferon (IFN-I) immune response are likely involved. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, dermatologists have observed an increase in pernio-like acral eruptions. Direct causality of pernio due to COVID-19 has not been established in many cases because of inconsistent testing methods (often negative results) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a form of COVID-19?associated pernio (also called COVID toes) is likely because of the increased occurrence, frequently in young patients with no cold exposure or prior history of pernio, and reports of skin biopsies with positive SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry. PubMed was searched for 2020 publications using the following keywords: pernio, chilblain, and acral COVID-19. On the basis of our review of the published literature, we speculate that several unifying cutaneous and systemic mechanisms may explain COVID-19?associated pernio: 1) SARS-CoV-2 cell infection occurs through the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), subsequently affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with an increase in the vasoconstricting, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic angiotensin II pathway. 2) SARS-CoV-2 cell infection triggers an immune response with robust IFN-I release in patients predisposed to COVID-19?associated pernio. 3) Age and sex discrepancies correlated with COVID-19 severity and manifestations, including pernio as a sign of mild disease, are likely explained by age-related immune and vascular differences influenced by sex hormones and genetics, which affect susceptibility to viral cellular infection, the RAAS balance, and the IFN-I response.","output":"Pernio (Chilblains), SARS-CoV-2, and COVID Toes Unified Through Cutaneous and Systemic Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an inflammatory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms range from mild infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation and intensive care. At the time of data collection, UK cases were around 300 000 with a fatality rate of 13% necessitating over 10 000 critical care admissions; now there have been over 4 million cases. Nutrition is important to immune function and influences metabolic risk factors such as obesity and glycaemic control, as well as recovery from acute illnesses. Poor nutritional status is associated with worse outcomes in ARDS and viral infections, yet limited research has assessed pre-morbid nutritional status and outcomes in patients critically unwell with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of body mass index (BMI), glycaemic control and vitamin D status on outcomes in adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients admitted to a central London ICU between March and May 2020 with confirmed COVID-19. Electronic patient records data were analysed for patient demographics; comorbidities; admission BMI; and serum vitamin D, zinc, selenium and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentrations. Serum vitamin D and HbA1c were measured on admission, or within 1 month of admission to ICU. Primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary outcomes included time intubated, ICU stay duration and ICU-related morbidity. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients; 54 (75%) men, mean age 57.1 (9.8) years, were included. Overall, mortality was 24 (33%). No significant association with mortality was observed across BMI categories. In the survival arm admission, HbA1c (mmol/mol) was lower, 50.2 vs 60.8, but this was not statistically significant. Vitamin D status did not significantly associate with mortality (p=0.131). However, 32% of patients with low vitamin D (<25 IU/L) died, compared with 13% of patients with vitamin D levels >26 IU/L. Serum zinc and selenium, and vitamin B(12) and folate levels were measured in 46% and 26% of patients, respectively. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Increased adiposity and deranged glucose homeostasis may potentially increase risk of COVID-19 infection and severity, possibly relating to impaired lung and metabolic function, increased proinflammatory and prothrombotic mechanisms. Vitamin D deficiency may also associate with poorer outcomes and mortality, supporting a possible role of vitamin D in immune function specific to pulmonary inflammation and COVID-19 pathophysiology. There are plausible associations between raised BMI, glycaemic control, vitamin D status and poor prognosis, as seen in wider studies; however, in this service evaluation audit during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, with a limited data set available for this analysis, the associations did not reach statistical significance.

Despite inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) recommendations, IIV uptake in patients with RD is suboptimal, a problem of increasing importance in the COVID\\\\19 era. We estimated the frequency of IIV hesitancy and associated factors among Canadian patients with RD. METHODS: A cross\\\\sectional vaccine hesitancy survey was completed by rheumatology clinic patients (November 2019 to January 2020). Patients rated their likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine (scale of 0\\\\10). We categorized these as follows: likely to refuse (scale of 0\\\\2), uncertain (scale of 3\\\\7), or likely to accept (scale of 8\\\\10). Multivariate logistical regression was used to evaluate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: A total of 282 patients (63.5% of those approached) completed the survey, with 165 (58.5%) being likely to accept, 67 (23.8%) being likely to refuse, and 50 (17.7%) uncertain. Uncertain patients were younger and more likely to be employed than those in the other two groups. No previous influenza vaccination (odds ratio [OR] 36.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3\\\\252.9), belief that vaccination should not be mandatory (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0\\\\0.7), unwillingness to take time off work to be vaccinated (OR 6.8, 95% CI 1.5\\\\30.6), and distrust in pharmaceutical companies (OR 41.0, 95% CI 5.6\\\\301.5) predicted likeliness to refuse.

The present study was conducted to examine the effects of the N- and C-terminal tags of uvsY on its function in RPA to detect SARS-CoV-2 DNA. METHODS: Untagged uvsY (uvsY-his), N-terminal tagged uvsY (uvsY-Nhis), C-terminal tagged uvsY (uvsY-Chis), and N- and C-terminal tagged uvsY (uvsY-NChis) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. RPA reaction was carried out with the in vitro synthesized standard DNA at 41 C. The amplified products were separated on agarose gels. RESULTS: The minimal initial copy numbers of standard DNA from which the amplified products were observed were 6  10(5), 60, 600, and 600 copies for the RPA with uvsY-his, uvsY-Nhis, uvsY-Chis, and uvsY-NChis, respectively. The minimal reaction time at which the amplified products were observed were 20, 20, 30, and 20 min for the RPA with uvsY-his, uvsY-Nhis, uvsY-Chis, and uvsY-NChis, respectively.

In 2020, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) led to an ongoing pandemic, known as \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\\". The disease can spread among individuals through direct (via saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets) or indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces) contact. The pandemic has spread rapidly from Asia to Europe and later to America. It continues to affect all parts of the world at an increasing rate. There have been over 92 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 by mid-January 2021. The similarity of homological sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-CoVs is high. In addition, clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS viruses show similarities. However, some COVID-19 cases show neurologic signs like headache, loss of smell, hiccups and encephalopathy. The drugs used in the palliative treatment of the disease also have some neurotoxic effects. Currently, there are approved vaccines for COVID-19. However, there is a need for specific therapeutics against COVID-19. This review will describe the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotoxicity of COVID-19 drugs used in clinics.

We used differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to explore how the blood transcriptome differs between individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, performing pairwise comparisons between groups. Increasing COVID-19 severity was characterised by an abundance of inflammatory immune response genes and pathways, including many related to neutrophils and macrophages, in addition to an upregulation of immunoglobulin genes.

Given the critical contribution of such activities in achieving health system quality goals, we undertook to address the question: What is known about work that has been done on patient engagement activities during the pandemic? OBJECTIVE: To examine peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify the range of patient engagement activities, broadly defined (inclusive of engagement to support clinical care to partnerships in decision-making), occurring within health systems internationally during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as key barriers and facilitators for sustaining patient engagement activities during the pandemic. METHODS: The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase and LitCOVID; a search for grey literature focused on the websites of professional organizations. Articles were required to be specific to COVID-19, describe patient engagement activities, involve a healthcare organization and be published from March 2020 to September 2020. Data were extracted and managed using Microsoft Excel. A content analysis of findings was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles were included. Few examples of more genuine partnership with patients were identified (such as co-design and organizational level decision making); most activities related to clinical level interactions (e.g. virtual consultations, remote appointments, family visits using technology and community outreach). Technology was leveraged in almost all reported studies to interact or connect with patients and families. Five main descriptive categories were identified: (1) Engagement through Virtual Care; (2) Engagement through Other Technology; (3) Engagement for Service Improvements/ Recommendations; (4) Factors Impacting Patient Engagement; and (5) Lessons Learned though Patient Engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of how healthcare systems and organizations stayed connected to patients and families during the pandemic was identified; the majority of activities involved direct care consultations via technology. Since this review was conducted over the first six months of the pandemic, more work is needed to unpack the spectrum of patient engagement activities, including how they may evolve over time and to explore the barriers and facilitators for sustaining activities during major disruptions like pandemics.","output":"A scoping review of patient engagement activities during COVID-19: More consultation, less partnership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome.

Methods We analysed data collected in a trial of hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis. Covid-19 cases and their contacts were identified through the local epidemiological surveillance system. VL, estimated by quantitative PCR, was assessed at enrollment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported Covid-19-like symptoms. Risk of transmission, risk of developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics were evaluated using random-effects regression analysis. Findings We identified 314 cases, 282 of which had at least one contact (753 contacts in total). Ninety (33%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 16% (125/753), with a variation from 12% to 24% for VL of the index case of <106, and >109 copies/mL, respectively (OR per log10 increase in VL 1.3 95%CI 1.1 to 1.6). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (OR 2.7; 1.4 to 5.06) and age of the contact (OR 1.02; 1.01 to 1.04). The proportion of PCR positive contacts who developed symptomatic Covid-19 was 40.3% (181/449), with a variation from 25% to 60% for VL of the contact <107, and >109 copies/mL (HR log10 increase in VL 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.2). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5 to 10) for individuals with an initial viral load <107 to 6 days (4 to 8) and 5 days (3 to 8) for individuals with an initial viral load of 107 to 109 and >109, respectively. Interpretation We show that the viral load of the index case is a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic Covid-19 is strongly associated with viral load of the contact at baseline, which shortens the incubation time in a dose-dependent manner.","output":"Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of COVID-19 cases in India and around the world has resulted in acute oxygen shortage.

AIM: Combining dual-energy X-ray and bone turnover markers (BTM) to explore the VitD level in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Harbin and monitor its effect on the anti-osteoporosis effect of ZOL. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) were enrolled .These patients were divided into two groups with 25(OH)D levels = 10ng/ml as a critical point, and each group was randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups). All of the patients were conducted 5 mg ZOL. Then the experimental group was given calcitriol and calcium carbonate, and the control group was only given calcium carbonate. BTM were measured at baseline, 24h, 3 months and 6 months. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD) of bilateral hips (TH BMD) and lumbar spine (LS BMD) at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: The VitD deficiency rates of the patients enrolled were 84.1%. There was an inverse relationship between the baseline level of VitD and the serum levels of P1NP / ?-CTX, (r=-0.452,p=0.00; r=-0.225, p=0.01). Comparing with baseline, the level of serum P1NP,?-CTX in each group declined significantly after the treatment (P<0.05). The mean decreasing rates of P1NP and ?-CTX in the both experimental groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups at the same time point (P<0.05), after 6 months of medication.

However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is subject to rapid mutations yielding more and more variants that might lose their affinity toward the currently used antibodies. The virus entry into the host cell involves interactions between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain. Consequently, ACE2 could be a target with limited mutation escaping possibilities. However, as the enzyme has not evolved to recognize the virus, its affinity with the spike protein receptor-binding domain is lower than that with specific antibodies. The present molecular dynamics simulations study suggests that the adsorption of the ACE2 on specific silane monolayers could increase its affinity toward the spike protein receptor-binding domain. Indeed, silane monolayers, combining silane molecules with short alkyl chains and positively charged head groups and silane molecules without charged head groups, could adsorb the ACE2 while maintaining its bioactivity (orientation compatible with the spike protein trapping, low conformational changes) and increasing its interactions with the spike protein receptor-binding domain (number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions) to lead to an increase by 20% both in the binding free energy and in the enzyme /receptor-binding domain rupture force.

Among these targets, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of COVID-19 spike protein (SP) does frequently occur in the repertoire of candidate vaccines. However, the immunogenicity of RBD per se is limited by its low molecular mass, and by a structural rearrangement of full-length SP accompanied by the detachment of RBD.

However, performance data are lacking, especially in asymptomatic people. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing when used for facility-wide testing during a nursing home outbreak. DESIGN: A prospective evaluation involving 3 facility-wide rounds of testing where paired respiratory specimens were collected to evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW antigen test compared with virus culture and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Early and late infection were defined using changes in RT-PCR cycle threshold values and prior test results. SETTING: A nursing home with an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. PARTICIPANTS: 532 paired specimens collected from 234 available residents and staff. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of positive agreement (PPA) and percentage of negative agreement (PNA) for BinaxNOW compared with RT-PCR and virus culture. RESULTS: BinaxNOW PPA with virus culture, used for detection of replication-competent virus, was 95%. However, the overall PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 69%, and PNA was 98%. When only the first positive test result was analyzed for each participant, PPA of antigen testing with RT-PCR was 82% among 45 symptomatic people and 52% among 343 asymptomatic people. Compared with RT-PCR and virus culture, the BinaxNOW test performed well in early infection (86% and 95%, respectively) and poorly in late infection (51% and no recovered virus, respectively). LIMITATION: Accurate symptom ascertainment was challenging in nursing home residents; test performance may not be representative of testing done by nonlaboratory staff. CONCLUSION: Despite lower positive agreement compared with RT-PCR, antigen test positivity had higher agreement with shedding of replication-competent virus. These results suggest that antigen testing could be a useful tool to rapidly identify contagious people at risk for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 during nascent outbreaks and help reduce COVID-19 burden in nursing homes.

Those explanations are based on the assumption that women take on the majority of childcare responsibilities, and take the same level of leave at the birth of a child. Changing social dynamics around parenting has seen fathers increasingly take an active role in parenting. This demands a more nuanced approach to understanding how parenting affects both men and women. Using a global survey of 11,226 academic parents, this study investigates the effect of parental engagement (Lead, Dual (shared), and Satellite parenting), and partner type, on measures of research productivity and impact for men and for women. It also analyzes the effect of different levels of parental leave on academic productivity. Results show that the parenting penalty for men and women is a function of the level of engagement in parenting activities. Men who serve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to serve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks. Taking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of productivity, however the productivity advantage is lost for the US-sample at 6 months, and at 12-months for the non-US sample.

The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-&#945;, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23109/L to 0.57109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable.

The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018 and June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million inhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined with a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the quarantine impact.

However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single-atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed.

METHODS This is a prospective cohort study involving patients scheduled to undergo pelvic reconstructive surgery. Eligible patients were enrolled at the preoperative appointment and compared by presence or absence of a support person. Questionnaires were completed before and after the preoperative appointment, 1-3 days before surgery, and at the postoperative appointment. Previsit questionnaires included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, 6-item short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and Brief Health Literacy screen. Postvisit questionnaires included the STAI-6, satisfaction with decision scale for pelvic floor disorders, preoperative preparedness questionnaire, and knowledge questionnaire. At the postoperative appointment, participants completed the patient global impression of improvement and postoperative symptom and satisfaction questionnaire. Primary outcome was patient anxiety measured by the STAI-6. RESULTS Seventy-six patients participated in the study: 37 were categorized in the support person cohort and 39 were categorized in the no support person cohort. The mean scores of the STAI-6 did not differ between the support person and no support person cohorts at all time points (previsit: 42.97  13.23 vs 41.53  17.11, P = 0.68; postvisit: 38.11  12.76 vs 36.33  11.72, P = 0.53, and 1-3 days before surgery: 42.61  13.0 vs 41.05  16.39, P = 0.65). Overall preparedness, satisfaction with decision scale for pelvic floor disorders, and knowledge questionnaire did not differ between cohorts at both time points.

To gain information on this risk, we studied the potential for reassortment between two contemporary H9N2 and H5N8 viruses. While the replacement of the PB2, PA, and NS genes of highly pathogenic H5N8 by homologous segments from H9N2 produced infectious H5N8 progeny, PB1 and NP of H9N2 were not able to replace the respective segments from H5N8 due to residues outside the packaging region. Furthermore, exchange of the PB2, PA, and NS segments of H5N8 by those of H9N2 increased replication, polymerase activity and interferon antagonism of the H5N8 reassortants in human cells. Notably, H5N8 reassortants carrying the H9N2-subtype PB2 segment and to lesser extent the PA or NS segments showed remarkably increased virulence in mice as indicated by rapid onset of mortality, reduced mean time to death and increased body weight loss. Simultaneously, we observed that in chickens the H5N8 reassortants, particularly with the H9N2 NS segment, demonstrated significantly reduced transmission to co-housed chickens. Together, while the limited capacity for reassortment between co-circulating H9N2 and H5N8 viruses and the reduced bird-to-bird transmission of possible H5N8 reassortants in chickens may limit the evolution of such reassortant viruses, they show a higher replication potential in human cells and increased virulence in mammals.","output":"Genetic incompatibilities and reduced transmission in chickens may limit the evolution of reassortants between H9N2 and panzootic H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 avian influenza virus showing high virulence for mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theworld iswelcoming the newnormal - the coronavirus pandemic has significantly changed the way people live, work, communicate and learn.

The objective of this study is to describe epidemiology of non-surgical febrile patients at the ED and to identify risk factors for adverse outcome. METHODS Blood, sputum, urine and faeces cultures, urine sediments and throat swaps for viral diagnostics were obtained from febrile ED patients. Outcome parameters were bacterial/viral infection, non-bacterial/non-viral infection, non-infectious febrile disease; mortality, hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stay. RESULTS 213 Patients were included (87.8% were hospitalised, 8.5% were admitted to ICU, 4.2% died). In 75 patients (35.2%), bacterial infection was confirmed; in 78 patients (36.6%) bacterial infection was suspected. In nine patients (4.2%), viral diagnosis was confirmed; in six patients (2.8%), a viral condition was suspected. The most frequently encountered infection was bacterial pneumonia (58 patients, 27.2%). Only older age was correlated with mortality (=0.176, p=0.01). CONCLUSION A majority of the febrile patients were admitted to the hospital, mostly for bacterial infection. An overall mortality rate of 4.2% was registered.

The CARES Act authorized a $600-per-week supplement, which hugely increased the value of unemployment benefits, such that the median jobless worker received unemployment benefits equal to 145% of their pre-job loss wages compared to 50% in normal times. The $600 weekly supplement expired at the end of July, however, causing the total value of unemployment benefits paid out to fall by 52 percent between July and August. In this paper, we present evidence that the increased unemployment benefits boosted both spending and savings among the unemployed and that upon the expiration of the $600 benefit supplement in August, families receiving unemployment benefits sharply cut spending and dipped into savings. Our first finding shows that spending of the unemployed increased by 22 percent upon receipt of unemployment benefits and declined by 14 percent in August with the expiration of the $600 supplement. Our second finding shows that the unemployed roughly doubled their liquid savings over the four month period between March and July 2020 but then spent two-thirds of the accumulated savings in August alone. Eventually, without further government support or significant labor market improvements, jobless workers may exhaust their accumulated savings buffer, leaving them with a choice to further cut spending or fall behind on debt or rent payments.","output":"The Unemployment Benefit Boost: Initial Trends in Spending and Saving When the $600 Supplement Ended"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients are suffering from related symptoms.

Currently, many clinics are facing difficulties in delivering optimal surveillance because of the increased number and complexity of kidney transplant recipients, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional ways of performing follow-up visits are needed and telemedicine has emerged as a tool to strengthen patient care intensity. Six Italian transplant surgeons and nephrologists convened via teleconference to develop a consensual model of video visits for the follow-up of kidney transplant recipients. Issues discussed were: profile of eligible patients; assessments that can be carried out; video visit organization and medical professionals involved; supporting tools and implementation. The video visit was consensually recognized as the most relevant for the follow-up of kidney transplant recipients. Eligible patients should have basic electronic devices and the skills to correctly use them and be in clinically stable condition.

However, the external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk Meter) is proposed. The FRM@ EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in addition to the Adrian & Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned countries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID -9 crisis and the Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose the suitable market for investment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For that purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies and FRM network centrality is developed.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HCW (n = 546) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW; n = 283) with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were recruited from a large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals. In this cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection status (as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs) by healthcare worker status and role. RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among HCW (7.3%) than in NHCW (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7, 9.3%).

METHODS Proteomic analysis of blood samples collected after overnight fast and mixed meal challenge in individuals with PBH, asymptomatic RYGB, severe obesity, or overweight recruited from outpatient hypoglycemia or bariatric clinics. RESULTS The top-ranking differentially abundant protein at 120 min after mixed meal was fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), an intestinally derived hormone regulated by bile acid-FXR signaling; levels were 2.4-fold higher in PBH vs. asymptomatic post-RYGB (mean + SEM, 1094  141 vs. 428  45, P < 0.001, FDR < 0.01).

While plasma bile acids did not differ between PBH and asymptomatic post-RYGB, these data suggest unique interrelationships between GLP-1 and FGF-19 in PBH.

We performed a deep analysis by flow cytometry of lymphocyte populations of 125 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients on the day of hospital admission. Five clusters of patients were identified using hierarchical classification on the basis of their immunophenotypic profile, with different mortality outcomes. Some characteristics were observed in all the clusters of patients, such as lymphopenia and an elevated level of effector CD8+CCR7- T cells. However, low levels of T cell activation are associated to a better disease outcome; on the other hand, profound CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia, a high level of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation and a high level of CD8+ T-cell senescence are associated with a higher mortality outcome. Furthermore, a cluster of patient was characterized by high B-cell responses with an extremely high level of plasmablasts.

Introduction: Viral pneumonia (PNA) causes oxidative stress to the pulmonary vasculature, triggering endothelial dysfunction and activation of the coagulation cascade. Elevations in coagulation markers, including d-dimer and fibrinogen, have been observed. Recent studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes endothelial cell injury, with activation of the coagulation cascade, and a high frequency of systemic thrombotic events. It remains unclear whether it is viral pneumonia itself, a specific viral strain (and/or viral load) that drives the clinical and thrombotic outcomes. Furthermore, limited data is available regarding clinical outcomes in a diverse patient population hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study is from a single urban medical center in Chicago, Illinois. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study evaluating the medical records of hospitalized adult patients admitted to University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System (UIHHSS) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia or other viral (H1N1 or H3N2) pneumonia between 10/01/2017 and 09/01/2020. Methods: Patients were included if 18 years old, hospitalized, with a primary confirmed diagnosis of viral pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2, H1N1 or H3N2) based on ICD-10 code, viral diagnostic testing, diagnosis description, and appropriate clinical characteristics/imaging studies. Past medical history, inpatient medications, coagulation parameters, arterial/venous thrombotic outcomes, and other clinical outcomes (renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, co-infection) were abstracted from UIHHSS electronic health record database. Results: Medical records of 257 patient with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia were reviewed, 199 patients with SARS-CoV-2 PNA (95 male, average age 58 years, 52% Hispanic, 37% non-Hispanic Black) and 58 patients with other viral PNA (24 male, average age 63 years, 21% Hispanic, 55% non-Hispanic Black; 34 with H3N2, 24 with H1N1). Coagulation parameters (maximum D-dimer, fibrinogen, INR) were similar in both groups; average D-dimer was >3x ULN. Anticoagulation therapy was similarly prescribed in both groups (SARS-CoV-2, 95% vs 84%, H1N1 or H3N2), with prophylactic dose anticoagulation prescribed most frequently (73% vs 62%) and with high average compliance rates (89% vs 83%). Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU; 32% vs 29%) and the median length of stay (10 vs 4 days) was similar in both groups. Thrombotic events (n = 6, 3%) occurred only in SARS-CoV-2 PNA patients in the ICU: 3 pulmonary embolism (PE), 1 distal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 2 non-ST elevated myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI). There was a significantly higher incidence of use of renal replacement therapy (8.5% vs 0%, p=0.016) and mortality (15.6% vs 3.4%, p=0.048) in the SARS-CoV-2 PNA group compared to the H3N2/H1N1 PNA group. There were no differences in the rates of mechanical ventilation, the incidence of major bleeding or co-infection. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (aOR 1.07), the presence of SARS-CoV-2 PNA (aOR 11.37), and ICU admission (aOR 41.95) were significantly associated with risk of mortality during hospitalization. Race and ethnicity were not associated with mortality. Conclusion: The overall incidence of thrombotic events was low and occurred only in the SARS-CoV-2 PNA group. The low rate of venous thrombosis detected in this group, especially in the ICU setting, is likely related to the reduced use of diagnostic studies during the first COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and to the high rates of anticoagulation prophylaxis orders and compliance. SARS-CoV-2 PNA was associated with a higher rate of renal failure and mortality compared to patients with H3N2/H1N1 viral pneumonia. There was no difference in mortality rates between Hispanic and non-Hispanic and between Black and non-Black patients. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia leads to greater endothelial dysfunction than that observed in H3N2/H1N1 viral pneumonia and that race/ethnicity does not drive mortality outcomes.

One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty. The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations. Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients. Methods: A prospective multi-centre study of COVID-19 patients  70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded. Results: The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72-78, range 70-96), 16.3% were older than 80 years and 21% of the patients were frail. The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95%CI 56-62), with 66% (63-69) in fit, 53% (47-61) in vulnerable and 41% (35-47) in frail patients (p<0.001). In frail patients, there was no difference in 30 day survival between different age categories. Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation. In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.

Strong TRPV1 stimulation with capsaicin causes mitochondrial damage in primary sensory neurons. However, the effect of repetitive and moderate exposure to capsaicin on the integrity of neuronal mitochondria remains largely unknown. Our electron microscopic analysis revealed that repetitive stimulation of the facial skin of mice with 10 mM capsaicin induced short-term damage to the mitochondria in small-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons. Further, capsaicin-treated mice exhibited decreased sensitivity to noxious heat stimulation, indicating TRPV1 dysfunction, in parallel with the mitochondrial damage in the trigeminal ganglion neurons. To analyze the capsaicin-induced mitochondrial damage and its relevant cellular events in detail, we performed cell-based assays using TRPV1-expressing PC12 cells. Dose-dependent capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity was observed. High doses of capsaicin caused rapid destruction of mitochondrial internal structure, while low doses induced mitochondrial swelling. Further, capsaicin induced a dose-dependent loss of mitochondria and autophagy-mediated degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). Concomitantly, transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, Mic60/Mitofilin, and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 was observed, which implied induction of mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for the loss of mitochondria. Collectively, although trigeminal ganglion neurons transiently exhibit mitochondrial damage and TRPV1 dysfunction following moderate capsaicin exposure, they appear to be resilient to such a challenge. Our in vitro data show a dose-response relationship in capsaicin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. We postulate that induction of mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in response to capsaicin stimulation play important roles in repairing the damaged mitochondrial system.","output":"Resilience to capsaicin-induced mitochondrial damage in trigeminal ganglion neurons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To offer an interpretation of bereaved parents' evaluations of communication with healthcare practitioners surrounding the death of a child.

Successful communication from healthcare practitioners takes account of parents' experiences related to these themes. Conclusions This study suggests that healthcare practitioners when communicating with bereaved parents need to recognise, and seek to comprehend, the ways in which the loss impacts upon an individual's identity as a parent, the 'physical' nature of the emotions that can be unleashed, and the ways in which the death of a child can alter their metaphorical conceptions of time.","output":"Metaphors that shape parents' perceptions of effective communication with healthcare practitioners following child death: a qualitative UK study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 crisis lockdown caused rapid transformation to remote working/learning modes and the need for e-commerce-, web-education-related projects development, and maintenance However, an increase in internet traffic has a direct impact on infrastructure and software performance We study the problem of accurate and quick web-project infrastructure issues/bottleneck/overload identification The research aims to achieve and ensure the reliability and availability of a commerce/ educational web project by providing system observability and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) methods In this research, we propose methods for technical condition assessment by applying the correlation of user-engagement score and Service Level Indicators (SLIs)/Service Level Objectives (SLOs)/Service Level Agreements (SLAs) measurements to identify user satisfaction types along with the infrastructure state Our solution helps to improve content quality and, mainly, detect abnormal system behavior and poor infrastructure conditions A straightforward interpretation of potential performance bottlenecks and vulnerabilities is achieved with the developed contingency table and correlation matrix for that purpose We identify big data and system logs and metrics as the central sources that have performance issues during web-project usage Throughout the analysis of an educational platform dataset, we found the main features of web-project content that have high user-engagement and provide value to services customers According to our study, the usage and correlation of SLOs/SLAs with other critical metrics, such as user satisfaction or engagement improves early indication of potential system issues and avoids having users face them These findings correspond to the concepts of SRE that focus on maintaining high service availability ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"User-engagement score and SLIs/SLOs/SLAs measurements correlation of e-business projects through big data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A reference standard is needed for quality control of protein subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to meet urgent domestic needs.

The potency and stability of the national candidate standard (CS) were determined by collaborative calibration, and accelerated and freeze-thaw degradation studies. Moreover, a suitability study of the CS was performed. Eight laboratories in mainland China were asked to detect antigen content of CS using a common validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit established by NIFDC and in-house kits in the collaborative study. Six laboratories returned valid results, which established that the antigen content of the CS was 876,938 YU/mL, with good agreement across laboratories. In the suitability study, the CS exhibited excellent parallelism and a linear relationship with four samples produced by different expression systems and target proteins.

UV-based technologies represent promising IPC tools: their effective application for sanitation has been extensively evaluated in the past but scant, heterogeneous and not conclusive evidence is available on their effect on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: With the aim of pooling the available evidence on the efficacy of UV technologies against coronaviruses, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library, and the main clinical trials' registries (WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane and EU Clinical Trial Register). Quantitative data on studies' interventionS were summarized in tables, pooled by different coronavirus species and strain, UV source, characteristics of UV light exposure and outcomes. FINDINGS: Eighteen papers met our inclusion criteria, published between 1972 and 2020. Six focused on SARS-CoV-2, four on SARS-CoV-1, one on MERS-CoV, three on seasonal coronaviruses, and four on animal coronaviruses. All were experimental studies. Overall, despite wide heterocenicity within included studies, complete inactivation of coronaviruses on surfaces or aerosolized, including SARS-CoV-2, was reported to take a maximum exposure time of 15 minutes and to need a maximum distance from the UV emitter up to 1 meter. CONCLUSION: Advances in UV-based technologies in the field of sanitation and their proved high virucidal potential against SARS-CoV-2 support their use for IPC in hospital and community settings and their contribution towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, we explored the global impact of environmental temperature and neonatal BCG vaccination coverage on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19. The COVID-19 data for reported cases, deaths and global temperature were collected from 31st December 2020 to 3rd April 2020 for 67 countries. Temperature data were split into quartiles for all three categories (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and mean temperature).

R0 is used to determine the ability of a disease to spread within a given population. The reproduction number (R) represents the transmissibility of a disease. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to calculate the R0 of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in Sri Lanka and to describe the variation of R, with its implications to the prevention and control of the disease. METHODS: Data was obtained from daily situation reports of the Epidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka and a compartmental model was used to calculate the R0 using estimated model parameters. This value was corroborated by using two more methods, the exponential growth rate method and maximum likelihood method to obtain a better estimate for R0. The variation of R was illustrated using a Bayesian statistical inference-based method. RESULTS: The R0 calculated by the first model was 1.02 [confidence interval (CI) of 0.75C1.29] with a root mean squared error of 7.72. The exponential growth rate method and the maximum likelihood estimation method yielded an R0 of 0.93 (CI of 0.77C1.10) and a R0 of 1.23 (CI of 0.94C1.57) respectively. The variation of R ranged from 0.69 to 2.20. CONCLUSION: The estimated R0 for COVID-19 in Sri Lanka, calculated by three different methods, falls between 0.93 and 1.23, and the transmissibility R has reduced, indicating that measures implemented have achieved a good control of disease.","output":"Estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) for the novel coronavirus disease in Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about end-of-life care among Muslim patients, particularly during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic, which we report here. METHODS: The clinical characteristics, end-of-life care and resuscitation status of Muslim patients who died in the ICU of our tertiary care hospital in year 2020 from COVID were compared to Non-COVID patients. RESULTS: There were 32 patients in COVID and 64 in the Non-COVID group. A major proportion, mainly of Non-COVID patients, already had a hospice eligible terminal disease at baseline (p=.002). COVID patients were admitted to the ICU sooner after hospitalization (2.2 vs. 17 days), had prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (18.5 vs. 6 days) and longer ICU stay (24 vs. 8 days) than non-COVID patients, respectively (p<.001). Almost all patients were \\"Full Code\\" initially. However, status was eventually changed to 'do-not-attempt resuscitation' (DNAR) in about 60% of the cohort. COVID patients were made DNAR late in their ICU stay, predominantly in the last 24 hours of life (p=.04). Until the very end, patients in both groups were on tube feeds, underwent blood draws and imaging, required high dose vasopressors, with few limitations or withdrawal of therapies. Family members were usually not present at bedside at time of death. There was minimal involvement of chaplain and palliative care services.

At day 8, iron status, serum biochemical parameters, serum metabolome, hepatic histology, and hepatic expression of genes for the metabolism were analyzed. Results indicated that piglets without iron supplementation had significantly reduced iron values and increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations at day 8 (p < 0.05). Analysis of serum metabolome revealed that concentrations of serum lysine, leucine, tyrosine, methionine, and cholesterol were significantly decreased while concentrations of 3-Methyldioxyindole, chenodeoxycholate acid, indoleacetic acid, icosadienoic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, pantothenic acid, ursocholic acid, and cholic acid were significantly increased in iron deficient piglets (p < 0.05).

The primary aim was to determine the mortality risk and associated variables when operating on urgent cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objective was to assess differences in the outcome of patients treated between sites treating COVID-19 and a separate surgical site. METHODS: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Secondary measures included complications of surgery, COVID-19 infection, and length of stay. Multiple variables were assessed for their contribution to the 30-day mortality. In total, 433 patients were included with a mean age of 65 years; 45% were male, and 90% were Caucasian. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 7.6% for all patients and 15.9% for femoral neck fractures. The mortality rate increased from 7.5% to 44.2% in patients with fracture neck of femur and a COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 rate in the 30-day postoperative period was 11%.

The interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed according to recurrent themes using the directed content analysis approach. Key themes identified included high quality midwifery care, information provision, costs, under/over treatment, interprofessional collaboration, and shared decision making. The quality of midwifery care during the COVID-19 pandemic was experienced to be sufficient, given the challenging circumstances. The midwives experienced the lack of face-to-face check-ups to be problematic. Unclear information and lack of personal protective equipment caused stress and confusion, and they worked an additional 2C4 h per working day. Some pregnant women were hesitant to call or visit them when they thought something was wrong. The midwives perceived some advantages in using video or telephone calls. Considerations for future pandemics include an additional face-to-face check-up between 16 and 27 weeks of pregnancy and one postpartum visit.

Despite considerable investments in research and development, the usage of DCT apps was found to be phenomenally low across the world. In this context, the current study investigates the factors influencing citizens continuance intentions to use the DCT app. Methods : A theoretical framework was developed by extending the Expectation-confirmation model (ECM) of Information system continuance with Technology trust theory and a contextual factor perceived security and privacy to predict citizens continuance intentions to use the DCT app. The model was empirically tested using data from a field survey of 206 actual users of a DCT app implemented in India. Results : The findings reveal that user satisfaction, trust in government, and trust in technology are significant predictors of citizens continuance intention. The model demonstrates high explanatory power by explaining 57.8% of the variance of continuance intention. It also validates the role of perceived security and privacy and trust in technology in determining user satisfaction.

METHODS AND RESULTS This prospective observational study included 35 patients admitted to a UK district general hospital with COVID-19 and evidence of cardiac involvement, that is, raised Troponin I levels or clinical evidence of heart failure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). All patients underwent echocardiography including speckle tracking for right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) providing image quality was sufficient (30 out of 35 patients). Upon comparison of patients who survived COVID-19 with non-survivors, survivors had significantly smaller RVs (basal RV diameter 38.2 vs 43.5 mm P = .0295) with significantly better RV function (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE): 17.5 vs 15.3 mm P = .049; average RVLS: 24.3% vs 15.6%; P = .0018). Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) maximal velocity was higher in survivors (2.75 m/s vs 2.11 m/s; P = .0045) indicating that pressure overload was not the predominant driver of this effect and there was no significant difference in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis of patients split into groups according to average RVLS above or below 20% revealed significantly increased 30-day mortality in patients with average RVLS under 20% (HR: 3.189; 95% CI: 1.297-12.91; P = .0195).

Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM10 concentration was 189 to 278 g/m3 in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 g/m3 after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3C5 C, noise level is dropped to <65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river. For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times.

Among them, Celiac disease (CeD) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease causing a plethora of symptoms from diarrhea and malabsorption to lymphoma. Even though GRDs have been intensively studied, the environmental triggers promoting the diverse reactions to gluten proteins in susceptible individuals remain elusive. It has been proposed that pathogens could act as disease-causing environmental triggers of CeD by molecular mimicry mechanisms. Additionally, it could also be possible that unrecognized molecular, structural, and physical parallels between gluten and pathogens have a relevant role. Herein, we report sequence, structural and physical similarities of the two most relevant gluten peptides, the 33-mer and p31-43 gliadin peptides, with bacterial pathogens using bioinformatics going beyond the molecular mimicry hypothesis. First, a stringent BLASTp search using the two gliadin peptides identified high sequence similarity regions within pathogen-derived proteins, e.g., extracellular proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Granulicatella sp. Second, molecular dynamics calculations of an updated -2-gliadin model revealed close spatial localization and solvent-exposure of the 33-mer and p31-43 peptide, which was compared with the pathogen-related proteins by homology models and localization predictors. We found putative functions of the identified pathogen-derived sequence by identifying T-cell epitopes and SH3/WW-binding domains. Finally, shape and size parallels between the pathogens and the superstructures of gliadin peptides gave rise to novel hypotheses about activation of innate immunity and dysbiosis. Based on our structural findings and the similarities with the bacterial pathogens, evidence emerges that these pathologically relevant gluten-derived peptides could behave as non-replicating pathogens opening new research questions in the interface of innate immunity, microbiome, and food research.","output":"Molecular and Structural Parallels between Gluten Pathogenic Peptides and Bacterial-Derived Proteins by Bioinformatics Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China.

METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to evaluate the independency of NCD4LR in predicting NCT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Compared with low NCD4LR patients, patients with high NCD4LR had an older age; higher incidence of fever, fatigue, chest distress/breath shortness, severer disease assessment on admission; higher levels of inflammatory indicators; low levels of lymphocyte subsets, and a longer NCT. Multivariate analysis also identified NCD4LR as an independent risk factor for delayed NCT.

How youth have been impacted by the pandemic, and which pre-existing factors best relate to COVID-19 responses, is of high importance for effective identification and treatment of those most vulnerable. Youth with pre-pandemic mental health difficulties like ADHD could be at risk for worse well-being during and after the pandemic. METHODS: The current study tested potential risk factors (i.e., pre-pandemic mental health, age, and parent education) and their relation to family experiences during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were previously enrolled in an on-going, yearly longitudinal study examining the relationship between mental health and executive functions in youths. Families with 1-4 annual pre-pandemic lab visits filled out an online COVID-19 survey in May-July 2020 to assess how the pandemic impacted their well-being (n=135 youth). RESULTS: Youth pre-pandemic mental health difficulties, especially ADHD symptoms, related to worse well-being during the early pandemic. Trajectories of recent ADHD symptoms over time also predicted cognitive difficulties during the pandemic. We found that youth age was a strong predictor of pandemic response, with younger youths showing fewer negative responses. Parental education level buffered family economics during early COVID-19. Families showed synchrony in their pandemic response. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-pandemic ADHD severity and slope, youth age, and parent education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) were risk factors that influenced youth or family well-being early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this information can help identify those who may need more community and educational support.","output":"Examination of Pre-Pandemic Measures on Youth Well-Being During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic presented numerous challenges to inpatient care, including overtaxed inpatient medicine services, surges in patient censuses, disrupted patient care and educational activities for trainees, underused providers in certain specialties, and personal protective equipment shortages and new requirements for physical distancing. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 surge began, an interdisciplinary group of administrators, providers, and trainees at Brigham and Womens Hospital created an inpatient virtual staffing model called the Virtual Team Rounding Program (VTRP). APPROACH: The conceptual framework guiding VTRP development was rapid-cycle innovation. The VTRP was designed iteratively using feedback from residents, physician assistants, attendings, and administrators from March to June 2020. The VTRP trained and deployed a diverse set of providers across specialties as virtual rounders to support inpatient teams by joining and participating in rounds via videoconference and completing documentation tasks during and after rounds. The program was rapidly scaled up from March to June 2020. OUTCOMES: In a survey of inpatient providers at the end of the pilot phase, 10/10 (100%) respondents reported they were getting either a lot or a little benefit from the VTRP and did not find the addition of the virtual rounder burdensome. During the scaling phase, the program grew to support 24 teams. In a survey at the end of the contraction phase, 117/187 (62.6%) inpatient providers who worked with a virtual rounder felt the rounder saved them time. VTRP leadership collaboratively and iteratively developed best practices for challenges encountered during implementation. NEXT STEPS: Virtual rounding provides a valuable extension of inpatient teams to manage COVID-19 surges. Future work will quantitatively and qualitatively assess the impact of the VTRP on inpatient provider satisfaction and well-being, virtual rounders experiences, and patient care outcomes.","output":"Virtual Team Rounding: A Cross-Specialty Inpatient Care Staffing Program to Manage COVID-19 Surges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity (p=0.92).

We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models transition from research to clinical practice. Methods: In this pilot study, we performed a literature search in the PubMed and WHO databases to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and were published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles. Results: The open source website currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work. Conclusion: We have successfully demonstrated in this pilot study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19.

This classification system can also be used to predict prognosis in different clinical subgroups. Further analysis suggested that high-risk patients were characterized by low immune scores, distinctive immune cell proportions, different immune checkpoint profiles, and a low tumor mutational burden.

However, circumstances where antibody formation is impaired after vaccination, such as in older people, require us to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin successful vaccination in order to improve vaccine design for at-risk groups. Here, by studying the breadth of anti-haemagglutinin (HA) IgG, serum cytokines, and B and T cell responses by flow cytometry before and after influenza vaccination, we show that formation of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells was associated with high-titre antibody responses. Using Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) class II tetramers, we demonstrate that HA-specific cTfh cells can derive from pre-existing memory CD4(+) T cells and have a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. In older people, the differentiation of HA-specific cells into cTfh cells was impaired. This age-dependent defect in cTfh cell formation was not due to a contraction of the TCR repertoire, but rather was linked with an increased inflammatory gene signature in cTfh cells. Together, this suggests that strategies that temporarily dampen inflammation at the time of vaccination may be a viable strategy to boost optimal antibody generation upon immunisation of older people.","output":"Impaired HA-specific T follicular helper cell and antibody responses to influenza vaccination are linked to inflammation in humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a surge of COVID-19 cases, the majority of care delivery at a large academic medical center moved to virtual care.

The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. OUTCOME MEASURES: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. RESULTS: Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286).

Pseudouridine (), the most common modification in RNA, was sequenced with a nanopore system using a protein sensor with a helicase brake in synthetic RNAs with 100% modification at 18 known human pseudouridinylation sites. The new signals were compared to native uridine (U) control strands to characterize base calling and associated errors as well as ion current and dwell time changes. The data point to strong sequence context effects in which  can easily be detected in some contexts while in others  yields signals similar to U that would be false negatives in an unknown sample. We identified that the passage of  through the helicase brake slowed the translocation kinetics compared to U and showed a smaller sequence bias that could permit detection of this modification in RNA. The unique signals from  relative to U are proposed to reflect the syn-anti conformational flexibility of  not found in U, and the difference in  stacking between these bases.

METHODS: A total of 159 T1-2 GC patients who had undergone surgery with lymphadenectomy between March 2012 and November 2017 were retrospectively collected and divided into a training cohort (n = 80) and a testing cohort (n = 79). Radiomic features were extracted from both tumor region and No. 3 station LNs based on computed tomography (CT) images per patient. Then, key features were selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and fed into two radiomic signatures, respectively. Meanwhile, the predictive performance of clinical risk factors was studied. Finally, a nomogram was built by merging radiomic signatures and clinical risk factors and evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) as well as decision curve. RESULTS: Two radiomic signatures, reflecting phenotypes of the tumor and LNs respectively, were significantly associated with LN metastasis. A nomogram incorporating two radiomic signatures and CT-reported LN metastasis status showed good discrimination of LN metastasis in both the training cohort (AUC 0.915; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.832C0.998) and testing cohort (AUC 0.908; 95% CI 0.814C1.000). The decision curve also indicated its potential clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram received favorable predictive accuracy in predicting No.3 LNM in T1-2 GC, and the nomogram showed positive role in predicting LNM in No.4 LNs. The nomogram may be used to predict LNM in T1-2 GC and could assist the choice of therapy.

To calculate the transmission rate, we propose a function that accounts for contact rate, duration of the contact, age structure of the population, susceptibility to infection, and the number of transmission events per contact. Moreover, the COVID-19 cases are divided into different groups according to the severity of their disease and are allocated to appropriate health facilities that provide care tailored to their needs. The multi-stage fuzzy stochastic programming approach is applied to cope with uncertainty, in which the probability associated with nodes of the scenario tree is treated as fuzzy variables. To handle the probabilistic model, we use a more flexible measure, [Formula: see text] measure, which allows decision-makers to adopt varying attitudes by assigning the optimistic-pessimistic parameter. This measure does not force decision-makers to hold extreme views and obtain the interval solution that provides further information in the fuzzy environment. We apply the proposed model to the case of Tehran, Iran. The results of this study indicate that assigning patients to appropriate medical centers improves the performance of the healthcare system. The result analysis highlights the impact of the demographic differences on virus transmission, and the older population has a greater influence on virus transmission than other age groups.

DESIGN: Observational descriptive cross-sectional study. DATA SOURCES: The study was carried out receiving 1089 questionnaires from non-health workers that were working away from home and doing so from their homes. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, physical symptoms, self-perceived health, use of preventive measures and possible contacts, and the Goldberg GHQ-12. RESULTS: 71.6% of non-health female workers and 52.4% of non-health male workers had psychological distress, with differences among those working away from home and those working from home. The level of psychological distress among non-health workers is predicted by 66.5% through the variables: being a woman, 43 years old or younger, having a home with no outdoor spaces, poor perception of health, number of symptoms, and having been in contact with contaminated people or material. Among workers who work away from home, being self-employed is another predictive variable of distress.

Machine learning-based medical imaging diagnostic approaches play an important role in tracking the spread of this virus, identifying high-risk patients, and controlling infections in real-time. Researchers aggregate radiographic samples from different data sources to establish a multi-source learning scheme to mitigate the insufficiency of COVID-19 samples from individual hospitals, especially in the early stage of the disease. However, data heterogeneity across different clinical centers with various imaging conditions is considered a significant limitation in model performance. This paper proposes a contrastive learning scheme for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 to effectively mitigate data heterogeneity in multi-source data and learn a robust and generalizable model. Inspired by advances in domain adaptation, we employ contrastive training objectives to promote intra-class cohesion across different data sources and inter-class separation of infected and non-infected cases. Extensive experiments on two public COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for tackling data heterogeneity problems with boosted diagnosis performance. Moreover, benefiting from the contrastive learning framework, our method can be generalized to solve data heterogeneity problems under a broader multi-source learning setting. ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Learning from heterogeneous data via contrastive learning: An application in multi-source covid-19 radiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The richness of social media data has opened a new avenue for social science research to gain insights into human behaviors and experiences.

PRIMARY PRACTICE OF SETTING: Acute care inpatient units in an academic medical center. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: A correlational design was utilized, and a prospective medical record review of patients was conducted while implementing face-to-face prehospital discharge meeting interventions. The study sample (N = 176) included adult patients in two neurosurgical wards who were admitted between June 2016 and September 2016. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to explore the balance between the intervention group receiving a face-to-face prehospital discharge meeting and comparison group receiving standard prehospital discharge care. Bivariate statistics were employed to determine associations between variables. RESULTS: A total of 15 sociodemographic and medical-surgical variables were used to correlate TFU reach rates, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmission rates. Educational attainment (p = .002), employment status (p = .014), parental status (p = .010), and hospital service (p = .039) had significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups. Results demonstrated an improved reach rate for the intervention group but despite the differences in the groups, phi and Cramer's V coefficients did not correlate any associations with TFU reach rate, ED visits, and readmission rates with sociodemographic and surgical variables. This outcome affirmed that despite the similarities and differences in the sample, a face-to-face meeting prehospital discharge is an effective intervention to improve telephone outreach. IMPLICATIONS TO CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: There is a need to determine the most cost-effective way to increase TFU reach rates to prevent subsequent ED visits and hospital readmissions. There is also a need to develop a tool that can predict the hardest-to-reach patients posthospital discharge, so that case managers can meet those patients before leaving the hospital.

This seems particularly feasible for update searches, where a machine classifier can be trained from past screening decisions. However, feasibility is unclear for broad topics. To evaluate the performance and implementation of machine classifiers for update searches of public health research. Two case studies. The first study evaluates the impact of using different sets of training data on classifier performance, comparing recall and screening reduction with a manual screening 'gold standard'. The second study uses screening decisions from a review to train a classifier that is applied to rank the update search results. A stopping threshold was applied in the absence of a gold standard. Time spent screening titles and abstracts of different relevancy-ranked records was measured. Results: Study one: Classifier performance varies according to the training data used; all custom-built classifiers had a recall above 93% at the same threshold, achieving screening reductions between 41% and 74%. Study two: applying a classifier provided a solution for tackling a large volume of search results from the update search, and screening volume was reduced by 61%. A tentative estimate indicates over 25 hours screening time was saved. Custom-built machine classifiers are feasible for reducing screening workload from update searches across a range of public health interventions, with some limitation on recall.

To do this, our approach repeatedly makes use of a heuristic for optimisation to efficiently find the best combination of the hyperparameters of a convolutional deep learning model. The framework starts with optimising a basic convolutional neural network which represents the starting point for the evolution process. Subsequently, at most two additional convolutional layers are added, at a time, to the previous convolutional structure as a result of a further optimisation phase. Each performed phase maximises the the accuracy of the system, thus requiring training and assessment of the new model, which gets gradually deeper, with relevant COVID-19 chest X-ray images. This iterative process ends when no improvement, in terms of accuracy, is recorded. Hence, the proposed method evolves the most performing network with the minimum number of convolutional layers. In this light, we simultaneously achieve high accuracy while minimising the presence of redundant layers to guarantee a fast but reliable model.

A search of electronic information was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Setting: Studies that compared the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected patients. Participants: Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Main outcome measures: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics and discrepant findings between both investigations. Results: Chest CT had a median sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.91 (range 0.82C0.98), 0.775 (0.25C1.00) and 0.87 (0.68C0.99), respectively, with RT-PCR as the reference. Importantly, early small, China-based studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger, non-China studies. Conclusions: A relatively high false positive rate can be expected with chest CT.

The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections.

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0 , variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1;95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12;k 0.04-0.2);however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","output":"Estimating the overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission using outbreak sizes outside China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic and affects all ages, even newborns.

MS coupled with various chromatography- and affinity-based techniques simplifies the complexity of the signals of the microbial biomarkers and provides more accurate results. Affinity-based methods, including those employing nanotechnology, can be used to concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions and, thereby, improve detection limits. Approaches combining amplification of nucleic acid targets from pathogens with MS-based detection are alternatives to biomarker analyses. Many data analysis methods, including multivariate analysis and bioinformatics approaches, have been developed for microbial identification. The review concludes with some current clinical applications of MS in the identification and typing of infectious microorganisms, as well as some perspectives.

Research has documented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout among healthcare workers during the pandemic. Thus, creative interventions are needed now more than ever to provide brief, accessible support to frontline workers. Virtual reality is a rapidly growing technology with potential psychological applications. In this study, we piloted a three-minute Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation of a nature scene to lower subjective stress among frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment units. We chose to film a nature scene because of the extensive empirical literature documenting the benefits of nature exposure and health. METHODS: A convenience sample of frontline healthcare workers, including direct care providers, indirect care providers, and support or administrative services, were recruited from three COVID-19 units located in the United States. Inclusion criteria for participation included adults aged 18 years and older who could read and speak in English and were currently employed by the healthcare system. Participants viewed a 360-degree video capture of a lush, green nature preserve in an Oculus Go or Pico G2 4K head-mounted display. Prior to viewing the simulation, participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire and the visual analogue scale to rate their subjective stress on a 10-point scale, with 1 = Not at all stressed to 10 = Extremely stressed. We conducted paired t-tests to examine pre- and post-simulation changes in subjective stress as well as Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to examine differences by demographic variables. All analyses were conducted in SPSS statistical software version 28.0. We defined statistical significance as a p-value less than .05. RESULTS: A total of 102 individuals consented to participate in the study. Eighty-four (82.4%) participants reported providing direct patient care, 73 (71.6%) identified as women, 49 (48.0%) were between the ages of 25C34 years old, and 35 (34.3%) had prior experience with VR. The pre-simulation mean stress score was 5.52.2, with a range of 1 to 10. Thirty-three (32.4%) participants met the 6.8 cutoff for high stress pre-simulation. Pre-simulation stress scores did not differ by any demographic variables. Post-simulation, we observed a significant reduction in subjective stress scores from pre- to post-simulation (mean change = -2.21.7, t = 12.749, p < .001), with a Cohens d of 1.08, indicating a very large effect. Further, only four (3.9%) participants met the cutoff for high stress after the simulation.

Even if we know part of the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2, (viral replication cycle, parameters and dynamics of transmissibility), in the absence of specific treatment, this paucy-symptomatic respiratory infection in the vast majority of cases, leads to mortality in about 1% of the cases and a morbidity of 10%. This resulted in a deep tension of our healthcare system. The diagnosis is based on the association of clinical signs of low respiratory infection and direct detection of the virus by PCR or indirect radiological pulmonary lesions. Very symptomatic and severe forms most often require hospital treatment. Once the diagnosis has been made, management is based on the recognition of severe cases and on symptomatic therapeutic measures: oxygenation, antibiotic therapy to prevent secondary infection, anticoagulation and hydration. Anti-viral treatments and immune-modulators for the second phase of the disease linked to a cytokine storm are being evaluated. Prevention is an essential element using specific patient path, protection of patients and caregivers by droplets and contact isolation (mask, personal hygiene, hydro-alcoholic solution) and physical and social distancing. These measures aim to counterbalance the saturation of the healthcare system by reducing epidemic peaks.

Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March. Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown. Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks. When used in real-time, we believe they can serve to identify transmission events and supplement traditional methods such as contact tracing.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains from genetic data: a Danish case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Insulator based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) is becoming increasingly important in emerging biomolecular applications, including particle purification, fractionation, and separation.

METHODS Twenty-two patients who underwent ultrasonographic assessment in MICS were reviewed retrospectively. In all patients, the right femoral artery was used for arterial cannulation. Ultrasonographic assessment was performed using a 15-MHz ultrasonography small probe, and regional oxygen saturation was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RESULTS The mean flow velocity at the distal side of the cannulation site was 46.2  25.4 cm/s. In six patients, a >40% decreased from baseline regional oxygen saturation was observed. In five of the six patients, the flow velocity was very slow, and spontaneous echo contrast was also observed in three cases. Their regional oxygen saturation was improved rapidly after distal leg perfusion. In the remaining case, the flow velocity was not decreased. In another one case, the stenosis at the cannulation site was detected after decannulation and repaired immediately. No limb ischemic complications were observed in this series.

This study aims to explore whether the centrifugation of synovial fluid could influence the positive result of LE strip caused by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). METHODS From March 2016 to December 2018, 64 patients who were diagnosed as PJI or aseptic arthritis and another 20 patients with inflammatory arthritis were enrolled in our study. After synovial fluid samples were obtained, the LE strip test was performed with and without centrifugation. Then clinicians read the color changes 3 min after the samples were dropped and classify the results based on the instruction of strip. The differences between septic and aseptic arthritis patients and septic and inflammatory arthritis patients were analyzed. RESULTS Among the included 21 PJI samples, 19 of them showed positive results (++) of LE strip before centrifugation. After centrifugation, two samples changed from two-positive (++) to one-positive (+), which is also considered as positive. Before centrifugation, 29 of the LE strip tests in the aseptic arthritis group (43 samples included) were ++ or +. After centrifugation, 16 of the samples yielded negative results. Among 20 samples with inflammatory arthritis, LE strip of 18 samples were positive (++ or +) before centrifugation, among which only 3 samples remained as positive after centrifugation. CONCLUSION LE strip test results could be influenced by inflammatory arthritis during the diagnosis of PJI.

Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA. Data was compiled and statistically analysed. Results: 204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males. Mean age of the study population was 51.44  16.501 years. Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample. Conclusion: Pre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers. RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures. However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team.","output":"Pre-Operative SARS CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction: A conundrum in surgical decision making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many factors have simultaneously affected peoples psychological distress (PD).

Abstract Introduction: The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has required adaptation by hospitals affected by the pandemic, which has caused a reduction in elective surgical activity. Material and method: Retrospective study of patients operated on in the previous month and during the peak of the pandemic. We analysed the COVID-19 infection rate, the severity of respiratory infection according to the Brescia respiratory COVID-19 severity scale (BRCSS), the adopted therapeutic measures and the overall postoperative complications. Results: From 17th February to 31st March 2020, there was a progressive decrease in surgical activity, with only 213 patients operated on. This comprised 59 (27.8%) elective operations for oncological diseases, 97 (45.5%) elective operations for benign diseases and 57 (26.7%) as urgent procedures. There was a progressive increase in the rate of infection by COVID-19, with a total of 15 cases (7%). This included 10 patients (16.9%) in the elective group for oncological disease, 1 (1%) in the elective surgery group for benign disease and 4 (7%) in the urgent surgery group (p <0.001). Five patients presented with a severe respiratory infection, of which 4 were affected by oncological disease. There were 3 deaths (1.4%), which were all due to the worsening of a respiratory infection. Conclusions: The patients undergoing the surgical procedures showed high rates of COVID-19 infection and postoperative complications, especially the patients with oncological diseases.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases. The primary endpoints were pathological outcomes, and the secondary endpoints included survival rate, sphincter preservation rate, R0 resection rate and toxicity. RevMan 5.3 was used to calculate pooled risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of seven eligible studies and 1865 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the LCCRT, SCRT/CCT increased pathologic complete response (pCR) rate [RR = 1.74, 95% CI (1.41, 2.15), P < 0.01] and led to a lower proportion of patients with adjuvant pathologic tumor stage 3C4 (ypT3-4) disease [RR = 0.88, 95% CI (0.80, 0.97), P = 0.01] or lymph node positive (ypN +) disease [RR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.71, 0.98), P = 0.02].

Studies conducted on the relationship between NII and bank risk for the USA and Europe have found that emphasis on income diversification lowers risk in European banks but exacerbates it in American banks. Current research on Asian banks has not led to a coherent view of the relationship between NII and bank risk. We employ data over 25 years for 24 Asian countries to examine this relationship. Using the GMM estimation approach we estimate equations for two time-periods, 1996C2007 and 2008C2018, to examine the NII-bank risk relationship in the presence of some controlling financial, macroeconomic and policy variables. Our results show that non-interest income worsens bank risk for all 24 countries as well as for sub-groups of countries. We also find that, by and large, economic growth improves bank risk while inflation above a threshold worsens it.

While quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTCPCR) is the most reliable method to detect viral genes of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for specific antiviral antibodies are also important as they identify false negative qRTCPCR responses, track how effectively the patients immune system is fighting the infection, and are potentially helpful for plasma transfusion therapies.

Inhaled NO was delivered in the ventilatory circuit of a continuous flow ventilator (Babylog 8000, Dr?ger) in a concentration of 20C80 ppm for 7 days. NO and NO(2) were continuously monitored (Polyton Draeger). Respiratory mechanics were evaluated by using the method of passive inflation by the ventilator. RESULTS: NO inhalation improved oxygenation (tcSaO(2)) and reduced respiratory system resistance without affecting arterial pressure. NO(2) level remained below 5 ppm, and methaemoglobin level below 1%. The child survived without neurologic sequela.

Multiple studies have struggled to determine the optimal strategy to combat, and ultimately prevent, trauma-induced coagulopathy. This chapter discusses the risks and benefits of resuscitation protocols utilizing plasma in its various forms. Plasma is the aqueous portion of blood that contains coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, albumin, immunoglobulins, and numerous other proteins. Plasma can be obtained via whole blood from phlebotomy or by apheresis. Once collected, it can be frozen for storage. If frozen within 8 hours, the product is labeled as fresh frozen plasma. If frozen after this window but within 24 hours, it is labeled as plasma frozen within 24 hours, or FP24. When these frozen forms are mobilized from the blood bank, they are thawed in a water bath to create thawed plasma, which can be stored in liquid form for up to 5 days prior to transfusion. Liquid plasma is a distinct product derived from whole blood and never frozen. While most centers employ its use for 21C26 days, it can be stored for up to 30 days prior to transfusion. Dried plasma is produced from frozen plasma by lyophilization or spray-drying and then later reconstituted for transfusion. These forms vary in their activity of coagulation factors, but all may be useful in the resuscitation of the injured patient. Beyond the well-known coagulation factors, other proteins and microparticles abound in plasma, and these have profound protective effects. Studies looking at the endotheliopathy associated with hemorrhagic shock have shown a decrease in the inflammatory response, promotion of endothelial repair, and decreased edema with plasma transfusion. Plasma also remains one of the best volume expanders and acid-base buffers available. Protocols utilizing plasma early in resuscitation, at the time of patient presentation, have shown a decrease in the amount of blood products transfused, as well as an improvement in survival. Transfusion ratios of plasma-platelet-red blood cell units in a 1:1:1 ratio show significant improvement reduction in hemorrhage-related mortality compared to 1:1:2. Adverse events are more common with plasma transfusion than with other fractionated blood products, but the overall incidence remains extremely low. Major risks include transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), infectious disease transmission, acute transfusion reactions, and leukocyte-associated reactions. Future possibilities for the development of plasma products have recently focused on dried plasma. French, German, and South African dried plasma products are currently used in their respective countries, but none is approved for use in the United States. With encouraging reports out of recent military and civilian prehospital use and numerous ongoing trials in the United States, dried plasma may be the solution to the many logistical problems inherent in frozen, thawed, and liquid plasma.","output":"Plasma Transfusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With smartphones' omnipresence in people's pockets, Machine Learning (ML) on mobile is gaining traction as devices become more powerful. With applications ranging from visual filters to voice assistants, intelligence on mobile comes in many forms and facets. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference remains a compute intensive workload, with devices struggling to support intelligence at the cost of responsiveness.On the one hand, there is significant research on reducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded devices. On the other hand, the strive to maximise the accuracy of a task is supported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of state-of-the-art DNNs a moving target. In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations. Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep learning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning models in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem.","output":"Smart at what cost?

We estimate parameters of a metacommunity SusceptibleCExposedCInfectedCRecovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about [Formula: see text] individuals (as of March 25, 2020).

DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Single academic institution, Parma University Hospital, Italy, between March 5, 2020 and March 15, 2020. Final follow-up: March 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS 500 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent HRCT as a gatekeeper were initially selected and the subgroup with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection formed the final study group. EXPOSURES SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality was the end point. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and HRCT data were collected from hospital electronic records, and HRCT features (CCS and PCAT) were measured post-hoc from HRCT images. RESULTS Among 500 patients with suspected COVID-19, 279 had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and formed the study group. Among them, 170 patients (61%) were discharged alive and 109 (39%) died. Comparing patients discharged alive with patients who died, the median age was 65 vs 77 (p<0.001), with males 56% vs 68% (p=0.061), prior cardiovascular disease 9% vs 24% (p=0.001), median D-dimer 723 vs 1083 ng/ml (p<0.001), median C-reactive protein 78 vs 148 mg/L (p<0.001), the mean CCS 17 vs 189 (p<0.001) and the median PCAT -76.4 HU vs -68.6 HU (p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, only age (p<0.001), D-dimer (p=0.041), C-reactive protein (p=0.002), extent of lung disease (p=0.002), and PCAT (p<0.001), remained associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increased age, D-dimer, C-reactive protein and the HRCT image features of extent of lung disease and coronary inflammation by PCAT (but not the CCS) were independently associated with mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to compare the inflammatory effects of NOTES and laparoscopy. METHODS Forty female pigs were assigned to transgastric, transrectal, and transvaginal NOTES and laparoscopic peritoneoscopy groups. Antiseptic technique was utilized for NOTES whereas laparoscopy was performed sterile. Intraperitoneal pressures were monitored and maintained below 15 mmH(2)O. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained with CO(2) in all groups. Pre- and postoperative blood samples of IL-6, Il-1, and TNF, and peritoneal fluid collected at surgery were analyzed. Animals were followed daily for 14 days. At necropsy, peritoneal fluid was collected for cytokine analysis. RESULTS Thirty-nine peritoneoscopies were successfully completed. The median procedure time was longer in the NOTES groups (57 min, range = 33-109) than in the laparoscopy group (33 min, range 32-36; P < 0.001); this was related to longer incision time and closure time. All 39 completed follow-up. Severe bleeding in the post-transrectal approach required early sacrifice of the remaining animal. Besides this, complications were similar among groups. At necropsy, adhesions were seen in four animals in the gastric group, five in the rectal group, two in the vaginal group, and two in the laparoscopic group (P = ns). There were no statistical differences in serum levels of TNF among the groups. When serum TNF values were expressed as the difference from the baseline, in the transvaginal group they were significantly lower than in the transrectal at 2 h [0.5 pg/ml (range = -14 to 59) vs. 60 pg/ml (range = -8 to 303); P = 0.041] and at 8 h [-5.5 pg/ml (range = -86 to 55] vs. 37 pg/ml (range = -30 to 62); P = 0.031]. The limitations of this study were that the analyses of IL-6 and Il-1 were not possible because most of the samples were below detectable levels, it was an animal model, and the sample size was small.

METHODS: From a registry of consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hub hospital in Italy from 25/02/2020 to 03/07/2020, we selected those  60 year-old and with cTnI measured within three days from the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When available, a second cTnI value within 48 h was also extracted. The relationship between increased cTnI and all-cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated by a Cox regression model and restricted cubic spline functions with three knots. RESULTS: Of 343 included patients (median age: 75.0 (68.0-83.0) years, 34.7% men), 88 (25.7%) had cTnI above the upper-reference limit (0.046 g/L). Patients with increased cTnI had more comorbidities, greater impaired respiratory exchange and higher inflammatory markers on admission than those with normal cTnI. Furthermore, they died more (73.9%vs. 37.3%, P &lt; 0.001) over 15 (6-25) days of hospitalization. The association of elevated cTnI with mortality was confirmed by the adjusted Cox regression model (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.06-2.52, P = 0.039) and was linear until 0.3 g/L, with a subsequent plateau.

Besides the inflammatory process and tissue damage, the presence of a cytokine storm has been related to a higher mortality rate. Other infectious viral diseases, such as Zika, chikungunya, and influenza, were associated with complications in pregnant women, such as growth restriction, malformation, preterm birth, low birth weight, miscarriage, and death, although they can also cause developmental disorders in infants and adolescents.

Emergency health care professionals (HCPs) are at risk of contracting nosocomial transmission of CCHF. We, therefore, aim to analyze the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) of at-risk physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in Pakistan and the factors associated with good KAP. METHOD A validated questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha 0.71) was used to collect data from HCPs in two CCHF endemic metropolitan cities of Pakistan by employing a cross-sectional study design. For data analysis percentages, chi-square test and Spearman correlation were applied by using SPSS version 22. RESULTS Of the 478 participants, 56% (n = 268) were physicians, 37.4% (n = 179) were nurses, and 6.5% (n = 31) were pharmacists. The proportion of HCPs with good knowledge, attitude, and perception scores was 54.3%, 81, and 69%, respectively. Being a physician, having more work experience, having a higher age, working in tertiary care settings, were key factors for higher knowledge (p < 0.001). The correlation coefficient showed significant positive correlation between attitude- perception (r = 0.560, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION We have observed average knowledge of HCPs. Therefore, we recommend time to time education campaigns and workshops in highly endemic CCHF regions to be launched by health ministries and HCPs, in particular nurses, encouraged to follow authentic academic sources of information to prevent nosocomial transmission.","output":"Knowledge, attitude and perceptions about Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) among occupationally high-risk healthcare professionals of Pakistan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly and presenting with different clinical features with different mortality rates worldwide. In the initial days of the pandemic, most of the patients presented with the complaints of lower respiratory tract infection of varying severity, and most of the deaths were also attributable to respiratory failure. As time progressed, more atypical presentations and causes of mortality were encountered according to different age groups. In the present scenario, a surge of COVID-19 cases is expected. Those new cases will also include patients with various problems requiring surgical interventions. In this brief review, we have discussed various presentations and mortality risks of COVID-19 infections in different age groups. We did literature searched on the PubMed database and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Altogether, 503 articles were retrieved out of which 31 were analyzed to put up this summary. Important atypical findings in neonates and infants were axial hypotonia, drowsiness, moaning sound, intussusception, and late-onset neonatal sepsis with the cause of death being multi-organ failure. Frequently reported comorbidities among children were hydronephrosis, leukemia, and intussusception. Observed risk factors for unfavorable outcome in the adult population were obesity, HIV, tuberculosis, and the intake of immunosuppressive agents in the form of anticancer drugs and steroids. The factors adding to the vulnerability in the elderly population could be enumerated as diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, obesity, and cancers. ? 2020 Bali Journal of Anesthesiology ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","output":"Influence of patient's age on the clinical presentation, morbidity, and mortality in COVID-19: A brief review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed both physical and psychological burdens on healthcare workers (HCWs).

Thus, the current study investigated the prevalence and gender differences of various MHPs among HCWs in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. This nationwide survey was conducted online from January 29 to February 3, 2020. General information was collected by questions about socio-demographics, work-related factors, and living situations. Depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Among the 2198 contacted HCWs, 1563 (71.1%) responded with valid data, of whom 1293 (82.7%) were females. The prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms in participants were 50.7%, 44.7%, 52.5%, and 36.1%, respectively. Female HCWs had significantly higher scores in all four scales (p < 0.001) and higher prevalences in all MHPs involved (range, odds ratio [OR] 1.55-1.97). After adjusting for potential confounders, female HCWs still had higher risks for all MHPs involved than males (range, adjusted OR 1.36-1.96). HCWs present high prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, female HCWs are more vulnerable to all MHPs involved.

Participants who knew more people who had been infected and those who lived in postal codes with higher prevalence of COVID-19 perceived their risk of infection to be higher and reported greater pandemic-related stress. Perceived risk of infection and pandemic-related stress were higher overall in women and those reporting greater future-orientedness. Finally, participants who were more politically conservative reported lower perceived risk of becoming infected and lower stress than those who were more liberal, but there was no reliable difference in mask wearing between these groups.

The demographic characteristics mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers were identified and inferential statistics t-test, ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to show the relationship between variables. RESULTS: A total of 230 healthcare workers (92% response rate) had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 80.88 and 7.881.32, respectively with good knowledge and a low positive attitude. Majority (94.7%) were familiar with the sign and symptoms, agreed that chronic diseases patients and HCWs are at a higher risk (97%) and (87.8%) respectively while knowledge related to COVID 19 vaccination, isolation period and treatment by antibiotics was poor with low positive attitude towards information availability about COVID 19 (41%), government ability to control the epidemic (49%), and the family members might get infection (60%). There was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and attitude scores (r=0.28, p<0.0001).

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data collected through a nationwide audit of people admitted to hospital with diabetes and COVID-19, conducted by the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists from March to October 2020. Prespecified demographic, clinical, medication and laboratory data were collected from the electronic and paper medical record systems of the participating hospitals by local clinicians. The primary outcome of the study, severe COVID-19, was defined as death in hospital and/or admission to the adult intensive care unit (AICU). Logistic regression models were used to generate age-adjusted ORs. RESULTS: Forty UK centres submitted data. The final dataset included 196 adults who were admitted to hospital and had both type 1 diabetes and COVID-19 on admission (male sex 55%, white 70%, with mean [SD] age 62 [19] years, BMI 28.3 [7.3] kg/m2 and last recorded HbA1c 76 [31] mmol/mol [9.1 (5.0)%]). The prevalence of pre-existing microvascular disease and macrovascular disease was 56% and 39%, respectively. The prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis on admission was 29%.

throughout the world causing a global health crisis Wide range of clinical presentations of COVID 19 has been demonstrated in the literature We present a case of isolated pleural effusion in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 METHODS: A 52-year-old male patient, presented with three weeks history of right sided chest pain, dyspnea, and fever On examination, patient was comfortable with normal vital signs during admission and chest examination was remarkable for decreased breath sound on the right side Investigations showed high C-reactive protein, raised ferritin, hyponatremia and increased liver enzymes Chest x -ray and CT scan demonstrated moderate right sided pleural effusion and pleural thickening with normal lung parenchyma Diagnostic pleural analysis was consistent with an exudative effusion with pleural fluid PH of 7 5, glucose of 6 8 mmol/L and very high LDH of 1185U/L The pleural fluid differential white cell count had 45% lymphocytes, 41% neutrophils, 9% eosinophils with cytology negative for malignant cells Pleural fluid stains and culture were negative for bacteria and tuberculosis RESULTS: In view of significant community spread of SARS-COV2, nasopharyngeal

We tested the hypothesis that the pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with substance use disorder by evaluating average daily 911 ambulance calls for substance use-related issues compared with all other calls. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 911 ambulance calls before and after the start of COVID-19 in Massachusetts. We used consecutive samples of 911 ambulance calls, categorized into those which were substance-related or not. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine if there were changes in numbers of daily calls before a statewide declaration of emergency for COVID-19 (February 15-March 9, 2020), from the emergency declaration until a stay-at-home advisory (March 10-March 22, 2020) and following the stay-at-home advisory (March 23-May 15, 2020). Results: Compared with prior to the statewide emergency, the post-statewide emergency average of daily ambulance calls decreased from 2,453.2 to 1,969.6, a 19.7% decrease. Similarly, calls for substance-related reasons decreased by 16.4% compared with prior to the statewide emergency. However, despite an initial decrease in calls, after the stay-at-home advisory calls for substance use began increasing by 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-1.1) calls/day, while calls for other reasons did not significantly change (+1.2 (95% CI -0.8 to 3.1) calls/day). Refusal of transport for substance-related calls increased from 5.0% before the statewide emergency to 7.5% after the declaration (p < 0.001). Conclusions: After an initial decline in substance-related ambulance calls following a statewide declaration of emergency, calls for substance use increased to pre-COVID-19 levels while those for other reasons remained at a lower rate.

However, the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the near-total temporary loss of the foodservice distribution channel, exposed a vulnerability that many found surprising. Instead of continued shortages, however, the agri-food sector has since moved back to near normal conditions with prices and production levels similar to those typically observed in years prior to the pandemic. Ironically, the specialization in most food supply chains designed for just-in-time delivery to specific customers with no reserve capacity, which led to the initial disruptions, may have also been responsible for its rapid rebound. A common theme in assessing the impacts across the six commodities examined is the growing importance of understanding the whole supply chain. Over the longer term, a continuation of the pandemic could push the supply chain toward greater consolidation of firms and diversification of products given the increasing option value of maintaining flexibility. Other structural changes will be felt through input markets, most notably labour, as the trend toward greater automation will continue to accelerate as a response to meeting concerns about a consistent supply of healthy and productive workers. The economic fall out from the pandemic may lead to greater concentration in the sector as some firms are not able to survive the downturn and changes in consumer food buying behaviour, including movement toward online shopping and enhanced demand for attributes associated with resiliency, such as local. On the other hand, online shopping may provide opportunities for small producers and processors to shorten supply chains and reach customers directly. In the long term, COVID-19 impacts on global commerce and developing country production are more uncertain and could influence poverty reduction.

Indications included three iatrogenic injuries, two impacted stones, two ureterovaginal fistulas, two idiopathic ureteral strictures refractory to conservative treatment, one primary transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter, one colon cancer metastasis to the ureter, and one invasive endometriosis. There were two proximal, three middle, and seven distal ureteral pathologies. RESULTS Tension-free anastomosis was achieved in all 12 patients. All patients with proximal and middle ureteral pathology received concomitant downward nephropexy (DN) as a standard part of RUU. Mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 52 years (range 30-69), mean body mass index was 30.0 kg/m(2) (range 21-38), mean operative room time was 190 minutes (range 104-354), mean estimated blood loss was 181 mL (range 50-400), and mean length of excised ureter on pathologic analysis was 2.0 cm (range 1.0-4.5). There was one intraoperative complication in which liver and gallbladder laceration occurred during trocar placement. Mean length of hospital stay was 1.4 days (range 1-5), and there were no postoperative complications. Mean follow up was 10 months (range 3-36). One patient had a ureteral stricture recurrence at 7 months postoperatively that led to renal unit loss and eventual nephrectomy. CONCLUSION RUU is feasible, safe, and demonstrates good outcomes for pathologies at the proximal, middle, and distal ureter.

The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Measurement of viral load requires the use of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), which in turn requires advanced equipment and techniques. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viral load measurement using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which is a simpler procedure compared to RT-qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The RT-LAMP assay was performed by using the Loopamp? 2019-SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent kit and 10-fold serial dilutions of known viral load RT-LAMP were used to measure Tt, which is the time until the turbidity exceeds the threshold. Based on the relationship between viral load and Tt, the linearity and detection sensitivity of the calibration curve were evaluated. In addition, 117 clinical specimens were measured, and RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assay results were compared. RESULTS: The dilution linearity of the calibration curve was maintained at five orders of magnitude 1.0 106 to 1.0  101 copies/L, and was confirmed to be detectable down to 1.0  100 copies/L.

The ILD consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high-resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes the linear and reticular pattern, the nodular pattern, the increased attenuation pattern (such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation), and the low attenuation pattern (such as emphysema and cystic lung diseases). In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, the final diagnosis of many ILD requires close cooperation between clinicians and radiologists and complementary lung biopsy is recommended in many cases.","output":"Interstitial Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant psychological disorder that can affect women during or after pregnancy. Its risk increases throughout the first 90 days and may last up to almost two years, which can create an overall burden on society. Although the etiology is unknown yet, there are risk factors that contribute to developing PPD. This study aims to assess the prevalence of PPD and the risk factors among women in Jeddah, western Saudi Arabia in 2019. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in infant vaccination clinics of the primary healthcare centers (PHC) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of National Guard (MNGHA) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) from mothers up to four months postpartum. Results Of the 172 postpartum women, the study estimated the prevalence of postpartum depression to be 20.9%. The significant risk factors predicted by multivariate regression analysis were history of previous depression (odds ratio {OR}=4.7; 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.9 to 11.5), difficult life event interval (OR=3.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 10.7), and attitude toward pregnancy (OR=2.1; 95% CI 0.9 to 4.5). Conclusion A fairly high prevalence of postpartum depression was revealed among the females in Jeddah.

However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we design a wireless smart face mask by integrating an ultrathin self-powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of 5.5 m) and lightest (total weight of 4.5 mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open-circuit voltage of up to 10 V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath-monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, we use it to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS Consecutive patients who experienced failed reperfusion and subsequently did or did not undergo RS at 16 comprehensive stroke centers were enrolled from January 2015 to June 2018. Propensity score matching was used to achieve baseline balance between the patient groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) at 48 hours and the modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in the two groups were compared. RESULTS A total of 90 patients with RS and 117 patients without RS after failed MT were enrolled. Propensity score matching analysis selected 132 matched patients. The good outcome rate was significantly higher in matched patients with RS than in those without RS (36.4% vs 19.7%, p=0.033), whereas the sICH (13.6% vs 21.2%, p=0.251) and mortality (31.9% vs 43.9%, p=0.151) were not significantly different between the groups.

Objective: To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200a?000 IU of vitamin D3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. Results: Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL). Median (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P = .59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P = .62). The difference between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P = .43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P = .30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P = .09). Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased after a single dose of vitamin D3 vs placebo (44.4 ng/mL vs 19.8 ng/mL; difference, 24.1 ng/mL [95% CI, 19.5-28.7]; P < .001). There were no adverse events, but an episode of vomiting was associated with the intervention. Conclusions and Relevance: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a single high dose of vitamin D3, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay.

The IRL selects predominantly group O donors tested for CMV, and these RBC are sometimes needed to fill orders for nongroup O patients. This study evaluated units sent that were out of group to fulfill CMV-seronegative requests. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Requests for CMV-seronegative and antigen-negative RBCs were divided into Period 1 (January 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) before intervention and Period 2 (March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020) post intervention. ABO Rh units requested were compared to ABO Rh units provided. RESULTS Period 1: 537 CMV-seronegative RBC units were provided. 99/188(52.66%) B-positive requests were fulfilled using O RBCs. 58/504 (11.51%) of D-negative units were sent to D-positive patients.

There are no detailed reports describing any other gastrointestinal effects of SARS-CoV-2 even though >3,000,000 people have died from COVID-19 worldwide. The purpose of this study is to report the intestinal findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection by way of a small case series including one with evidence of direct viral cytopathic effect and 2 with secondary injury attributed to viral infection. Infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemical stains directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in situ hybridization for spike protein-encoding RNA, and ultrastructural visualization of viruses within the epithelium. It induces cytoplasmic blebs and tufted epithelial cells without inflammation and may not cause symptoms. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause gastrointestinal symptoms after the virus is no longer detected, reflecting systemic activation of cytokine and complement cascades rather than direct viral injury. Reversible mucosal ischemia features microvascular injury with hemorrhage, small vessel thrombosis, and platelet-rich thrombi. Systemic cytokine elaboration and dysbiosis likely explain epithelial cell injury that accompanies diarrheal symptoms.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey of frontline healthcare workers using the PCL-5 for PTSD. Total of 212 frontline healthcare providers were included in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that PCL-5 is a reliable instrument in our sample. The total and subscale scores showed good internal consistency. The convergent and discriminant validity of the PCL-5 were also well demonstrated. Our result showed a better fit with the seven-factor hybrid model compared with other models and supported that the PCL-5 Chinese version can be used as a reliable screening tool to conduct psychological screening for Chinese healthcare workers. LIMITATION: We could not examine other aspects of reliability and validity like test-retest reliability or criterion validity. We didn't use the gold-standard structured interview for PTSD in our study. Besides, most of our samples were young people who had access to the internet.

This observational retrospective study aims to further investigate the potential pathophysiology through assessing the pattern of microhaemorrhage and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and microhaemorrhage. By comparing with similar patterns of microhaemorrhage in other non-COVID-19 disease, this study aims to propose possible common pathogenic mechanisms. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series was performed identifying all patients with COVID-19 complicated by cerebral microhaemorrhage on MRI. The distribution and number of microhaemorrhages were recorded using the microbleed anatomical scale, and patients baseline characteristics and salient test results were also recorded. RESULTS: Cerebral microhaemorrhages were noted to have a predilection for the corpus callosum, the juxtacortical white matter and brainstem. All patients had a preceding period of critical illness with respiratory failure and severe hypoxia necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a pattern of cerebral microhaemorrhage that is similar to the pattern reported in patients with non-COVID-19 related critical illness and other causes of severe hypoxia. This raises questions regarding whether microhaemorrhage occurs from endothelial dysfunction due the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or from the secondary effects of critical illness and hypoxia.","output":"Cerebral microhaemorrhage in COVID-19: a critical illness related phenomenon?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medical experts in the domain of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) acquire specific knowledge from diabetic patients through monitoring and interaction. This allows them to know the disease and information about other conditions or comorbidities, treatments, and typical consequences of the Mexican population. This indicates that an expert in a domain knows technical information about the domain and contextual factors that interact with it in the real world, contributing to new knowledge generation. For capturing and managing information about the DM, it is necessary to design and implement techniques and methods that allow: determining the most relevant conceptual dimensions and their correct organization, the integration of existing medical and clinical information from different resources, and the generation of structures that represent the deduction process of the doctor. An Ontology Network is a collection of ontologies of diverse knowledge domains which can be interconnected by meta-relations. This article describes an Ontology Network for representing DM in Mexico, designed by a proposed methodology. The information used for Ontology Network building include the ontological resource reuse and non-ontological resource transformation for ontology design and ontology extending by natural language processing techniques. These are medical information extracted from vocabularies, taxonomies, medical dictionaries, ontologies, among others. Additionally, a set of semantic rules has been defined within the Ontology Network to derive new knowledge. RESULTS: An Ontology Network for DM in Mexico has been built from six well-defined domains, resulting in new classes, using ontological and non-ontological resources to offer a semantic structure for assisting in the medical diagnosis process. The network comprises 1367 classes, 20 object properties, 63 data properties, and 4268 individuals from seven different ontologies. Ontology Network evaluation was carried out by verifying the purpose for its design and some quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the Ontology Network offers a set of well-defined ontological modules facilitating the reuse of one or more of them. The inclusion of international vocabularies as SNOMED CT or ICD-10 reinforces the representation by international standards. It increases the semantic interoperability of the network, providing the opportunity to integrate other ontologies with the same vocabularies. The ontology network design methodology offers a guide for ontology developers about how to use ontological and non-ontological resources in order to exploit the maximum of information and knowledge from a set of domains that share or not information.","output":"An ontology network for Diabetes Mellitus in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tocilizumab is FDA-indicated for the adult treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis, and pediatric treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis Tocilizumab has a non-FDA-indicated use in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients prescribed tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis","output":"Tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past decade, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a timely and cost-effective alternative to bacterial identification.

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during a rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during the early adoptive phase (6 April 2020-17 April 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performed telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (293 telemedicine encounters, response rate 40.6%) and 14 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n = 74, 70.6%), and the most common duration was 15 to 29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as \\"excellent\\" or \\"very good\\" across measures (91.6%-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved was in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.7%. Most physicians (57.1%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1 to 4 sessions (71%). Nearly all physicians (92.9%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians. This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices.","output":"Telemedicine During COVID-19 for Outpatient Sports and Musculoskeletal Medicine Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer vaccines (CVs) represent a long-sought therapeutic and prophylactic immunotherapy strategy to obtain antigen-specific T-cell responses, and potentially achieve long-term clinical benefit. However, historically, most CV clinical trials have resulted in disappointing outcomes, despite promising signs of immunogenicity across most formulations. In the past decade, technologic advances regarding vaccine delivery platforms, tools for immunogenomic profiling and antigen/epitope selection have occurred. Consequently, the ability of CVs to induce tumor-specific and, in some cases, remarkable clinical responses have been observed in early-phase clinical trials. It is notable that the record-breaking speed of vaccine development in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic mainly relied on manufacturing infrastructures and technological platforms already developed for CVs. In turn, research, clinical data, and infrastructures put in place for the SARS-CoV2 pandemic can further speed CV development processes. This review outlines the main technological advancements as well as major issues to tackle in the development of CVs.

To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place. FINDINGS: As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 34% of the 82 312 150 cases and 36% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 826% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (22%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

The attenuated Sterne strain of B. anthracis, which lacks the plasmid encoding capsule, is widely adapted as a vaccine strain. Although differences in the outcome of infection with the two strains may have originated from the presence or absence of an anti-phagocytic capsule, the disease pathogenesis following infection will be manifested via the host responses, which is not well understood. To gain understanding of the host responses at cellular level, a microarray analysis was performed using primary rhesus macaque AMs infected with either Ames or Sterne spores. Notably, 528 human orthologs were identified to be differentially expressed in AMs infected with either strain of the B. anthracis. Meta-analyses revealed genes differentially expressed in response to B. anthracis infection were also induced upon infections with multiple pathogens such as Francisella Novicida or Staphylococcus aureus. This suggests the existence of a common molecular signature in response to pathogen infections. Importantly, the microarray and protein expression data for certain cytokines, chemokines and host factors provide further insights on how cellular processes such as innate immune sensing pathways, anti-apoptosis versus apoptosis may be differentially modulated in response to the virulent or vaccine strain of B. anthracis.

Signaling through this receptor is thought to influence the immune activity of microglia as well as monocytes egress from the bone marrow (BM) and their trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) in several neurological diseases. During experimental herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE), CCR2 deficiency has been reported to exacerbate the outcome of the disease. However, the precise contribution of CCR2 expressed in cells of the CNS or peripheral monocytes in the protection against HSE remains unclear. To dissect the differential role of CCR2 during HSE, chimeric mice with receptor deficiency in the brain or blood cells were generated by transplanting wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or CCR2(-/-) BM-derived cells in CCR2(-/-) (WTCCR2(-/-)) and WT (CCR2(-/-)WT) mice, respectively. Our results indicate that following intranasal infection with 1.2x10(6) plaque forming units of HSV-1, CCR2 deficiency in hematopoietic cells and, to a lesser extent, in CNS exacerbates the outcome of HSE. Mortality rates of CCR2(-/-) (71.4%) and CCR2(-/-)WT (57.1%) mice were significantly higher than that of WT (15.3%; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively) but the difference did not reach statistical significance for WTCCR2(-/-) animals (42.8%; P = 0.16). Both peripheral and CNS deficiencies in CCR2 resulted in increased infectious viral titers and wider dissemination of HSV antigens in the brain as well as an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system altered monocytes egress from the BM and their recruitment to the CNS, which may contribute to the failure in HSV-1 containment. Collectively, these data suggest that CCR2 expressed on cells of CNS and especially on peripheral monocytes is important for the control of HSV-1 replication and inflammatory environment during experimental HSE.","output":"Both Cerebral and Hematopoietic Deficiencies in CCR2 Result in Uncontrolled Herpes Simplex Virus Infection of the Central Nervous System in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In most guidelines, upper rectal cancers (URC) are not recommended to take neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation. However, the definitions of URC vary greatly. Five definitions had been commonly used to define URC: 1) >10 cm from the anal verge by MRI; 2) >12 cm from the anal verge by MRI; 3) >10 cm from the anal verge by colonoscopy; 4) >12 cm from the anal verge by colonoscopy; 5) above the anterior peritoneal reflection (APR). We hypothesized that the fifth definition is optimal to identify patients with rectal cancer to avoid adjuvant radiation. METHODS: The data of stage II/III rectal cancer patients who underwent radical surgery without preoperative chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. The height of the APR was measured, and compared with the tumor height measured by digital rectal examination (DRE), MRI and colonoscopy. The five definitions were compared in terms of prediction of local recurrence, survival, and percentages of patients requiring radiation. RESULTS: A total of 576 patients were included, with the intraoperative location of 222 and 354 tumors being above and straddle/below the APR, respectively. The median distance of the APR from anal verge (height of APR) as measured by MRI was 8.7 (range: 4.5C14.3) cm. The height of APR positively correlated with body height (r=0.862, P<0.001).

Rectal cancer above the APR had a significantly lower incidence of local recurrence than those straddle/below the APR (P=0.042). For those above the APR, there was no significant difference in local recurrence between the radiation and no-radiation group. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor location regarding APR was an independent risk factor for LRFS. Tumor height as measured by DRE, MRI and colonoscopy were not related with survival outcomes. Fewer rectal cancer patients required adjuvant radiation using the definition by the APR, compared with other four definitions based on a numerical tumor height measured by MRI and colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of URC as rectal tumor above the APR, might be the optimal definition to select patients with stage II/III rectal cancer to avoid postoperative adjuvant radiation.","output":"Which Definition of Upper Rectal Cancer Is Optimal in Selecting Stage II or III Rectal Cancer Patients to Avoid Postoperative Adjuvant Radiation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION Building reliable phylogenies from very large collections of sequences with a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites is challenging because sequencing errors and recurrent/backward mutations interfere with the phylogenetic signal, confounding true evolutionary relationships. Massive global efforts of sequencing genomes and reconstructing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 strains exemplify these difficulties since there are only hundreds of phylogenetically informative sites and millions of genomes. For such datasets, we set out to develop a method for building the phylogenetic tree of genomic haplotypes consisting of positions harboring common variants to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate and fast phylogenetic inference of resolvable phylogenetic features. RESULTS We present the TopHap approach that determines spatiotemporally common haplotypes of common variants and builds their phylogeny at a fraction of the computational time of traditional methods. We develop a bootstrap resampling strategy that resamples genomes spatiotemporally to assess topological robustness. The application of TopHap to build a phylogeny of 68,057 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (68KG) from the first year of the pandemic produced an evolutionary tree of major SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. This phylogeny is concordant with the mutation tree inferred using the co-occurrence pattern of mutations and recovers key phylogenetic relationships from more traditional analyses. We also evaluated alternative roots of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and found that the earliest sampled genomes in 2019 likely evolved by four mutations of the most recent common ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes. An application of TopHap to more than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes reconstructed the most comprehensive evolutionary relationships of major variants, which confirmed the 68KG phylogeny and provided evolutionary origins of major variants of concern.

Sampling at different stages allows us to reconstruct a pseudo-temporal trajectory of the innate response. A surge of CD169(+) monocytes associated with an IFN-(+)MCP-2(+) signature rapidly follows symptom onset. At later stages, we observe a persistent inflammatory phenotype in patients with severe disease, dominated by high CCL3 and CCL4 abundance correlating with the re-appearance of CD16(+) monocytes, whereas the response of mild COVID-19 patients normalizes.

We previously reported that DC-SIGN mediated H5N1 influenza A virus (AIVs) infection, however, the important DC-SIGN interaction with N-glycosylation sites remain unknown. This study aims to identify the optimal DC-SIGN interacting N-glycosylation sites in HA proteins of H5N1-AIVs. Results from NetNGlyc program analyzed the H5 hemagglutinin sequences of isolates during 2004C2020, revealing that seven and two conserved N-glycosylation sites were detected in HA1 and HA2 domain, respectively. A lentivirus pseudotyped A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 envelope (H5N1-PVs) was generated which displayed an abundance of HA5 proteins on the virions via immuno-electron microscope observation. Further, H5N1-PVs or reverse-genetics (H5N1-RG) strains carrying a serial N-glycosylated mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis assay. Human recombinant DC-SIGN (rDC-SIGN) coated ELISA showed that H5N1-PVs bound to DC-SIGN, however, mutation on the N27Q, N39Q, and N181Q significantly reduced this binding (p < 0.05). Infectivity and capture assay demonstrated that N27Q and N39Q mutations significantly ameliorated DC-SIGN mediated H5N1 infection. Furthermore, combined mutations (N27Q&N39Q) significantly waned the interaction on either H5N1-PVs or -RG infection in cis and in trans (p < 0.01). This study concludes that N27 and N39 are two essential N-glycosylation contributing to DC-SIGN mediating H5N1 infection.","output":"Identification of Important N-Linked Glycosylation Sites in the Hemagglutinin Protein and Their Functional Impact on DC-SIGN Mediated Avian Influenza H5N1 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Lower muscle mass is a known predictor of unfavorable outcome, but its prognostic impact on COVID-19 patients is unknown. Purpose To investigate the contribution of CT-derived muscle status in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods Clinical/laboratory data and outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission and death) were retrospectively retrieved for patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19, who underwent chest CT on admission in four hospitals in Northern Italy from February 21 to April 30, 2020. Extent and type of pulmonary involvement, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion were assessed. Cross-sectional areas and attenuation of paravertebral muscles were measured on axial CT images at T5 and T12 vertebral level. Multivariable linear and binary logistic regression, including calculation odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were used to build four models to predict ICU admission and death, tested and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results A total 552 patients (364 men; median age 65 years, interquartile range 54-75) were included. In a CT-based model, lower-than-median T5 paravertebral muscle area showed the highest ORs for ICU admission (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.7-8.5; P<.001) and death (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-2.9; P=.027).

Thus, timely primary PCI has been emphasized in order to improve outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations on trying to reduce the door-to-balloon time to <90 minutes in order to reduce mortality, less attention has been paid to other components of time to treatment, such as the symptom-to-balloon time, as an indicator of the total ischemic time, which includes the symptom-to-door time and door-to-balloon time, in terms of clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine the association between each component of time to treatment (ie, symptom-to-door time, door-to-balloon time, and symptom-to-balloon time) and in-hospital MACCEs among patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI. METHODS In this observational study, according to a prospective primary PCI 24/7 service registry, adult patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI in one of six catheterization laboratories of Tehran Heart Center from November 2015 to August 2019, were studied. The primary outcome was in-hospital MACCEs, which was a composite index consisting of cardiac death, revascularization (ie, target vessel revascularization/target lesion revascularization), myocardial infarction, and stroke. It was compared at different levels of time to treatment (ie, symptom-to-door and door-to-balloon time <90 and 90 minutes, and symptom-to-balloon time <180 and 180 minutes). Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24 (IBM Corp), with descriptive statistics, such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation, and statistical tests, such as chi-square test, t test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and with a significance level of <.05 and 95% CIs for odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS Data from 2823 out of 3204 patients were analyzed (mean age of 59.6 years, SD 11.6 years; 79.5% male [n=2243]; completion rate: 88.1%). Low proportions of symptom-to-door time 90 minutes and symptom-to-balloon time 180 minutes were observed among the study patients (579/2823, 20.5% and 691/2823, 24.5%, respectively). Overall, 2.4% (69/2823) of the patients experienced in-hospital MACCEs, and cardiac death (45/2823, 1.6%) was the most common cardiac outcome. In the univariate analysis, the symptom-to-balloon time predicted in-hospital MACCEs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4; P=.03), while the symptom-to-door time (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.6; P=.34) and door-to-balloon time (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.8, P=.77) were not associated with in-hospital MACCEs. In the multivariate analysis, only symptom-to-balloon time 180 minutes was associated with in-hospital MACCEs and was a predictor of in-hospital MACCEs (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS A longer symptom-to-balloon time was the only component associated with higher in-hospital MACCEs in the present study.

Multiple genetic approaches have been carried out, primarily in adults with extrapolation to children, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS), and target gene analyses. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from adults with severe COVID-19 have identified genomic regions (human leukocyte antigen locus and 3p21.31) as potential risk factors. Genes related to viral entry into cells (ABO blood group locus, ACE2, TMPRS22) have been linked to severe COVID-19 patients by GWAS and target gene approaches. Type I interferon (e.g. IFNAR2) and antiviral gene (e.g. TLR7) associations have been identified by several genetic approaches in severe COVID-19. WES has noted associations with several immune regulatory genes (e.g. SOCS1). Target gene approaches have identified mutations in perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway genes in children and adults with severe COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. SUMMARY: Several genetic associations have been identified in individuals with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C via various genetic approaches.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand how the quality of visual input and different forms of image degradation can contribute to worse performance on sustained attention tasks, particularly those with dynamic and complex visual stimuli. This study investigated the impact of image degradation on an adapted version of the gradual-onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), where participants must discriminate between gradually fading city and mountain scenes. Thirty-six normal-vision participants completed the task, which featured two blocks of six resolution and contrast levels. Subjects either completed a version with gradually fading or static image presentations. The results show decreases in image resolution impair performance under both types of temporal dynamics, whereas performance is only impaired under gradual temporal dynamics for decreases in image contrast. Image similarity analyses showed that performance has a higher association with an observer's ability to gather an image's global spatial layout (i.e. gist) than local variations in pixel luminance, particularly under gradual image presentation. This work suggests that gradually fading attention paradigms are sensitive to deficits in primary visual function, potentially leading to these issues being misinterpreted as attentional failures.","output":"The impact of image degradation and temporal dynamics on sustained attention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different routes of assembly are probed for the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the bitopic membrane protein Vpu from HIV-1.

CASE REPORTS: We present the cases of 3 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 via RT-PCR in their third trimester of pregnancy. All patients underwent emergent cesarean sections and were managed on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit and eventually discharged in stable condition. CONCLUSIONS: Early cesarean section and aggressive management with mechanical ventilation has been shown to be very beneficial for mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 and their infants. All 3 patients were successfully extubated, and all 3 infants tested negative for COVID-19, suggesting no vertical transmission; although, further studies are needed to confirm this finding.","output":"Successful Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in COVID-19 Pregnant Women: An Institutional Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main transformation dynamics in the province of Potenza territory (Basilicata region in the south of Italy) correspond to those of urban sprinkling. The urban sprinkling phenomena is typical of mainly mountainous internal areas with indices of settlement density and artificial coverage ratios very low. The temporal and spatial analysis of the urban sprinkling phenomenon gives a picture of the transformation dynamics of the territory, i.e. the phenomena of fragmentation and compaction of the urban territory. Through a logistic regression, the driving factors that have affected the dynamics of urban transformation and specifically the phenomena of fragmentation and compaction between 1998 and 2013 will be analyzed. The two transformation phenomena (dependent variables Y), will be analyzed separately and built on the basis of the variation of the sprinkling index in the analyzed period. In the model, eleven independent variables concerning physical characteristics, proximity analysis, socioeconomic characteristics and the urban policies or constraints, have been considered. The result of the logistic regression consists of two probability maps of change of the dependent variable Y from non-urban to fragmented or compacted. The indexes of the relative operational characteristic (ROC) of 0.85 and 0.84 respectively for compaction and fragmentation, testify the goodness of the model.","output":"Analyzing the Driving Factors of Urban Transformation in the Province of Potenza (Basilicata Region-Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit the cellular entry of a broad range of viruses, but it has been suspected that for HIV-1 IFITMs may also inhibit a post-integration replicative step.

Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking this site via neutralizing antibody or nanobody could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","output":"Critical Interactions Between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein and the Human ACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wenyang Jing and Erik Procko.

Charcot arthropathy of the knee (CK) is rare and diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in detrimental outcomes. This scoping review aims to investigate the literature on CK, present the pathognomonic features of CK to aid early diagnosis, and suggest gaps in the literature for future research. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science for literature relevant to CK was performed. Primary studies such as case reports, case series, retrospective studies were included. Review articles and animal studies were excluded. RESULTS: Of the 513 results, 58 were included in qualitative synthesis. Average time from symptom onset to CK diagnosis was 50.5 months. Eighteen and twenty-one studies included patients who had diabetes mellitus and syphilis, respectively. Twenty-one studies reported pain as a presenting complaint, but the degree of pain didnt correspond with the level of destruction. Oedema and joint effusion were noticed in 34 studies. Twenty-nine studies reported lower limb hypoesthesia and 17 studies reported decreased tendon reflex. Twenty-eight studies reported initial conservative treatment, often in a knee brace with minimal weight bearing, 9 of which needed subsequent surgical management. Twelve studies utilised arthrodesis, with fracture at the intramedullary nail entry site being the most common complication. Twenty-four studies utilised TKA. CONCLUSION: The literature on CK remains sparse, with most publications being case reports. Given that CK dramatically reduces quality of life, increases morbidity of patients, there is need for more literature on evidence-based options for early diagnoses and management.

Information on other outcomes is less well explored in patients without diabetes in a long\\\\term perspective. We aimed to explore the relationship between admission glucose level and long\\\\term outcomes in patients with AMI without diabetes in a nationwide setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients without diabetes (n=45 468) with AMI registered in SWEDEHEART (Swedish WebCSystem for Enhancement and Development of Evidence\\\\Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) and admission glucose 11 mmol/L (198 mg/dL) were followed for outcomes (AMI, heart failure, stroke, renal failure, and death) between 2012 and 2017 (mean follow\\\\up time 3.31.7 years). The association between categorized glucose levels and outcomes was assessed in adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses (glucose levels 4.0C6.0 mmol/L [72C109 mg/dL] as reference). Further nonfatal complications and their associated mortality were explored (patients without events served as a reference). A glucose level of 7.8C11.0 mmol/L (140C198 mg/dL) was associated with hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 1.40 [95% CI, 1.30C1.51], P<0.001), renal failure (1.17; 1.04C1.33, P=0.009), and death (1.31; 1.20C1.43, P<0.001), but not with recurrent myocardial infarction (0.99; 0.92C1.07, P=0.849) or stroke (1.03; 0.88C1.19, P=0.742).

Risk factors for COVID-19 include asthma, elderly age, being pregnant, having any underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and experiencing lifelong systemic racism. Recently, connections to certain genes have also been found, although the susceptibility has not yet been established. We aimed to investigate the available evidence for the genetic susceptibility to COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a systematic review of current evidence to investigate the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19. By systematic search and utilizing the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct, we retrieved all the related papers and reports published in English from December 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: According to the findings, COVID-19 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry. Previous studies have shown that people with ACE2 polymorphism who have type 2 transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2) are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, two studies have shown that males are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 than females. Besides, research has also shown that patients possessing HLA-B*15:03 genotype may become immune to the infection. CONCLUSION: Combing through the genome, several genes related to immune system's response were related to the severity and susceptibility to the COVID-19.

We used a two-step strategy for the detection of B.1.1.7 with initial screening through ThermoFisher TaqPathTM SARS-CoV-2 kit followed by partial sequencing of Spike (S) gene of samples having spike gene target failure (SGTF) on real-time PCR. From January 01, 2021, to February 21, 2021, a total of 2,650 samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using TaqPathTM kit and 70.4% (n=1,867) showed amplification of all the 3 genes (S, N, and ORF). Notably, 29.6% (n=783) samples had the spike gene target failure (SGTF). The SGTF cases were detected at a low frequency during the first three weeks of January (n=10, n=13, and n=1 respectively) however, the cases started to increase in the last week. During February, 726 (93%) cases of SGTF was reported with a peak (n=345) found during the 3rd week. Based on the partial sequencing of spike gene of SGTF samples (n=15), 93% (n=14) showed the characteristic N501Y, A570D, P681H, and T716I mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant. Our findings highlight the high prevalence of B.1.1.7 in Pakistan and warrant large scale genomic surveillance and strengthening of laboratory network in the country.","output":"An upsurge of SARS CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Variant in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The second wave of Covid-19 that started in mid-February 2021 in Mumbai is now subsiding. Increasingly the focus amongst the policy makers and general public is on the potential third wave. Due to uncertainties regarding emergence of new variants and reinfections, instead of projecting our best guess scenario, in this report we conduct an extensive scenario analysis for Mumbai and track peak fatalities in the coming months in each of these scenarios. Our key conclusions are - As per our model, about 80% of Mumbai population has been exposed to Covid-19 by June 1, 2021. Under the assumption that all who are exposed have immunity against further infection, it is unlikely that Mumbai would see a large third wave. It is the reinfections that may lead to a large wave. Reinfections could occur because of declining antibodies amongst the infected as well as by variants that can break through the immunity provided by prior infections. Even under a reasonably pessimistic scenario we observe the resulting peak to be no larger than that under the second wave. We further observe that under the scenario where the reinfections are mild so that they affect the fatality figures negligibly, where the new variants (beyond the existing delta variant) have a mild impact, as the city opens up, we observe a small wave in the coming months. However, if by then the vaccine coverage is extensive, this wave will be barely noticeable.

This study aimed to examine the acute mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis as well as coping strategies employed by disadvantaged community members in North India. METHODS: We used an intersectional lens for this qualitative study set in rural Tehri Garwhal and urban Dehradun districts of Uttarakhand, India. In-depth interviews were conducted in May 2020 during lockdown, by phone and in person using purposive selection, with people with disabilities, people living in slums with psychosocial disabilities and widows (total n = 24). We used the framework method for analysis following steps of transcription and translation, familiarisation, coding, developing and then applying a framework, charting and then interpreting data. FINDINGS: The participants with compounded disadvantage had almost no access to mobile phones, health messaging or health care and experienced extreme mental distress and despair, alongside hunger and loss of income. Under the realms of intrapersonal, interpersonal and social, six themes related to mental distress emerged: feeling overwhelmed and bewildered, feeling distressed and despairing, feeling socially isolated, increased events of othering and discrimination, and experiencing intersectional disadvantage. The six themes summarising coping strategies in the COVID-19 crisis were: finding sense and meaning, connecting with others, looking for positive ways forward, innovating with new practices, supporting others individually and collectively, and engaging with the natural world. CONCLUSIONS: People intersectionally disadvantaged by their social identity experienced high levels of mental distress during the COVID-19 crisis, yet did not collapse, and instead described diverse and innovative strategies which enabled them to cope through the COVID-19 lockdown. This study illustrates that research using an intersectional lens is valuable to design equitable policy such as the need for access to digital resources, and that disaggregated data is needed to address social inequities at the intersection of poverty, disability, caste, religious discrimination and gender inherent in the COVID-19 pandemic in India.","output":"\\"We've got through hard times before: acute mental distress and coping among disadvantaged groups during COVID-19 lockdown in North India - a qualitative study\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breathing rate monitoring is a must for hospitalized patients with the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

OBJECTIVE: To determine how health insurance coverage changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of trends in insurance coverage based on repeated cross sections of the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey data, using linear regression to adjust for respondents demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and state of residence. More than 1.2 million US adults aged 18 to 64 years were surveyed from April 23 through December 21, 2020. EXPOSURES: The COVID-19 pandemic, separated into spring and summer and fall and winter time periods during 2020, as well as state Medicaid expansion status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regression-based estimates of the weekly percentage-point change in respondents health insurance status, including having any health insurance, any employer-sponsored health insurance, or only nonemployer sponsored coverage. Nonemployer-sponsored coverage is categorized into private, Medicaid, and other public in some analyses. RESULTS: The study population included 1 212 816 US adults (51% female; mean [SD] age, 42 [13] years) across all 50 US states and Washington DC. Among these respondents, rates of employer-sponsored coverage declined by 0.2 percentage points each week during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other types of coverage, particularly from public sources, increased by 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points in the spring and summer and fall and winter periods, respectively. Overall, health insurance coverage of any type declined, particularly during the spring and summer period, during which uninsurance increased by 1.4 percentage points, representing more than 2.7 million newly uninsured people, over a 12-week period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey, results showed that while public programs played an important role in protecting US adults from pandemic-driven declines in employment-sponsored coverage, many people became uninsured during 2020.","output":"Trends in US Health Insurance Coverage During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study investigated the 1-year clinical outcomes of directional atherectomy combined with drug-coated balloon (DA + DCB) in femoropopliteal artery disease (FPAD) from real-world experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of patients treated between July 2016 and June 2019 using DA + DCB for FPAD. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, clinical characteristics and outcomes, and angiography and duplex ultrasound findings were analyzed. The 6-month and 1-year primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors of primary patency loss or CD-TLR. RESULTS Seventy-nine consecutive patients (83 lesions, mean age 70.9 years, 52 men) were included. Twenty-seven limbs had lifestyle-limiting claudication and 56 limbs had critical limb ischemia. There were 73 and 10 limbs with de novo lesion and in-stent restenosis, respectively. The mean lesion length of all the patients was 22.1 cm. The mean length of chronic total occlusions (CTOs) was 8.3 cm. Severe calcification was found in 32.5% cases. The 1-year primary patency rate was 80.8% and freedom from CD-TLR was 92.2%. The bailout stenting rate was 2.4%. Patients with CTO >10 cm had significantly lower 1-year primary patency rate and freedom from CD-TLR than did patients with CTO 10 cm. Total length of CTO (stratified as 5 cm, 5-10 cm, >10 cm) was identified as an independent risk factor of 1-year primary patency loss and CD-TLR. CONCLUSION DA + DCB appears to be a safe and effective endovascular therapy to treat FPAD in real-world clinical practice, with a promising 1-year patency rate with a low rate of bailout stenting.","output":"One-Year Clinical Outcome and Risk Factor Analysis of Directional Atherectomy Followed With Drug-Coated Balloon for Femoropopliteal Artery Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic due to COVID-19 has had a huge psychological impact on individuals all over the world, in particular the international literature is noting an increase in pathologies among children and adolescents adolescenti (Pappa et al. 2020, Keles et al. 2020, Pigaiani et al. 2020, Solmi et al. 2021). Adolescence is a time when individuals observe physical changes in their bodies, experience new interests and desires, and find themselves with greater freedom, independence and responsibility; although variably defined, adolescence is generally believed to begin with the onset of puberty and end with assuming social roles as adults (Dahl 2004, Spear 2000). Among the changes that the adolescent has to face are: accepting one's body, acquiring a social role, female or male, establishing new relationships with peers of both sexes, achieving emotional independence from parents and other adults, acquiring social behavior responsible, learn a system of values and an ethical conscience as a guide to one's behavior, develop intellectual skills and prepare for a profession, achieve independence (Juli 2020). All this is not always easy and, many times young people find themselves facing a tortuous path that can give rise to the onset of some mental pathologies; if we then take into account the pandemic period we are experiencing, all this can get complicated.

In the current study we used mice deficient for the CXCL10 receptor, CXCR3, to evaluate its role in leukocyte-mediated viral clearance of WNV infection within various CNS compartments. WNV-infected CXCR3-deficient mice exhibited significantly enhanced mortality compared with wild-type controls. Immunologic and virologic analyses revealed that CXCR3 was dispensable for control of viral infection in the periphery and in most CNS compartments but, surprisingly, was required for CD8 T cell-mediated antiviral responses specifically within the cerebellum. WNV-specific, CXCR3-expressing T cells preferentially migrated into the cerebellum, and WNV-infected cerebellar granule cell neurons expressed higher levels of CXCL10 compared with similarly infected cortical neurons. These results indicate that WNV differentially induces CXCL10 within neuronal populations and suggest a novel model for nonredundancy in chemokine-mediated inflammation among CNS compartments.","output":"CXCR3 mediates region-specific antiviral T cell trafficking within the central nervous system during West Nile virus encephalitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract EP after TEE represents a medico-surgical emergency Given the high rate of asymptomatic patients with COVID 19, the risk of contamination and the frailty of esophageal tissues, we should check coronavirus infection in every patient before TEE","output":"An exceptional complication of transesophageal ultrasound in a patient with Coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer has a great socio-sanitary relevance.

Few studies evaluate the effects of robotic surgery in elderly patient, and even fewer are those that compare it with laparoscopic surgery in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of robotic colorectal surgery compared to laparoscopic colorectal surgery in patients older than 65 years. We conducted a retrospective study enrolling 83 elderly patients (age > 65) undergoing robotic and laparoscopic colectomy (32 and 51, respectively) between January 2019 and January 2021. For statistical analysis, p values were calculated using t test and chi-square test. p < 0.05 is the criterion for statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed with the Number Cruncher Statistical System (NCSS) 2020 data analysis version 20.0.1 (Utah, USA). The operation time was higher in robotic left (p = 0.003, mean time 249.6 vs 211.7 min) and right (p = 0.004, mean time 238.5 vs 183.5 min) hemicolectomy and similar for procedures on rectosigmoid and rectum when compared to laparoscopic technique. In terms of length of hospital stay and recovery of bowel function, these values were significantly lower for robotic group in left hemicolectomy (p = 0.004), rectum (p = 0.003) and rectosigmoid (p = 0.003), while right hemicolectomy was similar in two groups (p = 0.26). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding conversion rate, postoperative complications, length of specimen, number of lymph nodes encountered and oncological results.

METHODS: This observational study was conducted at the Intensive Care Department which covered 5 ICUs with 60 single-bedded rooms. We described qualitatively and, as applicable, quantitatively the response of intensive care services to the outbreak. The clinical course and outcomes of healthcare workers (HCWs) who had MERS were noted. RESULTS: Sixty-three MERS patients were admitted to 3 MERS-designated ICUs during the outbreak (peak census = 27 patients on August 25, 2015, and the last new case on September 13, 2015). Most patients had multiorgan failure. Eight HCWs had MERS requiring ICU admission (median stay = 28 days): Seven developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, four were treated with prone positioning, four needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 63.4 % (0 % for the HCWs). In response to the outbreak, the number of negative-pressure rooms was increased from 14 to 38 rooms in 3 MERS-designated ICUs. Patients were managed with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:0.8. Infection prevention practices were intensified. As a surrogate, surface disinfectant and hand hygiene gel consumption increased by ~30 % and 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day on average. Family visits were restricted to 2 h/day. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, all reported to work normally. During the outbreak, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS-designated ICUs reported upper respiratory symptoms, and were tested for MERS-CoV.

There significant differences between those living in care and their community dwelling peers, with evidence showing those in care having fewer teeth and significantly higher levels of dental decay. There are numerous Cochrane reviews linking the use of fluoride to a reduction in dental decay, however, the majority of research on effectiveness has been conducted on children and consequently, children and adolescents tend to be the main recipients of fluoride interventions. There are to date no studies comparing the effectiveness of fluoride interventions in older people in care homes in the UK. However, prior to developing an appropriate protocol for full-scale trial comparing clinical effectiveness of fluoride interventions, there are a number of trial feasibility and statistical parameters that need to be clarified. METHODS: This trial is a single centre, multi-site randomised controlled assessor blind parallel group (three groups) trial, with the primary objective of establishing the feasibility, practicability and compliance of fluoride interventions to prevent dental decay in care homes. Secondary and tertiary objectives will aim to explore the acceptability of the interventions from resident, care home and dental services perspectives, and estimate the efficacy of the three different fluoride treatments. DISCUSSION: This feasibility trial will produce new knowledge and add value to a landscape that is under researched. Although the efficacy of fluoride interventions is proven, the feasibility of dental research and prevention in this vulnerable group and in the complex care home setting is novel. This work will not only add to our understanding of the interface of dental care and social care but will also contribute to our broader understanding on undertaking research in care home settings. Dental care for older people has been a longstanding issue, and the events of this past year has shone a light on the vulnerabilities of those residing in care homes and so this research is landing at a pivotal time.

The story, still unfolding, has all the elements of a recipe for disaster: one of the most elderly populations in the world; a weakened SNS, the result of a litany of policies and interventions by the 'Troika' (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund); a health care delivery system focused on non-communicable diseases and long-term care; the growing public distrust in public services, compared to private, hotel-like health care facilities. We are aware that these are still the early days of the epidemic, yet it is safe to say that algorithmic scenarios of doom and gloom have so far been averted. In the past six months of the pandemic, the level of trust of the Portuguese population in the SNS and its health personnel has significantly improved, while the government has started to provide additional funding and to work for the expansion of the public system. At the very inception of the pandemic, private hospitals practically closed their doors to COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly a new disease, COVID-19, by definition the foe of any health system, has granted the opportunity for a rare consensus amongst different key political and/or corporate actors in a long-called-for reform of the SNS. Social science and humanities, with their analytical tools and theoretical-conceptual frameworks, are mandatory in providing well-funded answers to such riddles and better grasping the reasons for the twist and turns.","output":"The Unlikely Saviour: Portugal's National Health System and the Initial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: A local service evaluation was conducted in order to compare clinical assessment measures and management decisions between an ophthalmic nurse practitioner and a reference standard glaucoma consultant, for patients referred into secondary care with suspected Chronic Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension. METHODS: One hundred patients were selected. A clinical pathway incorporating the assessment methods recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Glaucoma update 2017 (NG81) was delivered by a single ophthalmic nurse practitioner and the reference standard glaucoma consultant. Clinical findings and outcomes were recorded, with both practitioners being masked to each others findings. Agreement was determined employing Cohens kappa, measuring inter-rater agreement allowing for chance agreement. RESULTS: Agreement was observed as follows: Visual field assessment (kappa k = 0.806, 95% CI 0.661C0.951); Optical Coherence Tomography evaluation (kappa k = 0.648, 95% CI 0.507C0.798); C:D Ratio assessment (Cronbachs alpha  = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88C0.94); Diagnosis (kappa k = 0.874, 95% CI 0.818C0.914); and Treatment planning (kappa  = 0.844, 95% CI 0.733C0.955). In three cases the nurse practitioner judged the optic nerve to appear normal, where the reference standard examiner detected glaucoma and commenced treatment. CONCLUSION: This service evaluation demonstrates how an ophthalmic nurse practitioner with appropriate theoretical knowledge and practical training, can develop skills to reach a high level of agreement in patient assessment and management for those patients with suspected glaucoma. Within the limitations of a single centre and single practitioner evaluation, our findings provide evidence that this model of capacity expansion ought to merit wider consideration in secondary care glaucoma services.","output":"Ophthalmic nurse practitioner assessment of glaucoma: evaluating agreement within an initiative to enhance capacity in glaucoma clinics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first described in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern It was named by the World Health Organization as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it garnered unprecedented attention from public health researchers around the world, and studies analyzing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapy have arisen in the last 2 months Objective To review the literature and describe updated facts about the ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an important side effect that can be present in patients with COVID-19 treated with these drugs Data Synthesis The most typical treatment regimen is 5 days of hydroxychloroquine at daily doses of 400 to 600 mg There is no randomized clinical trial that can prove so far the efficacy of this medication, and few studies have evaluated adverse events potentially linked to their use in patients with COVID-19 While there is no concrete evidence on the incidence of ototoxicity using chloroquine in the short term, we need to consider that, as a pandemic disease, millions of patients with COVID-19 may receive this treatment, and ototoxicity can be a possible adverse event Conclusion Despite the urgent global situation caused by the COVID-19, the risk of irreversible hearing loss may outweigh the unproven benefit of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, especially in patients with mild forms of COVID-19, who may be cured with supportive treatment The potential hearing loss that can be caused by these medications may advise against their use in COVID-19 patients","output":"Chloroquine and COVID-19: Should We Care about Ototoxicity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Transfusion of convalescent immune plasma (CP) is commonly used in epidemics. Several articles now describe clinical report data of CP for treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 disease. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted using the NCBI curated COVID-19 related open-resource literature database LitCovid to identify studies using CP as treatment for COVID-19 patients. We retrieved and curated all COVID-19 related patient and treatment characteristics from previously reported studies. A Poisson model was developed to evaluate the association between age of the patients, older age being the most common risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, and recovery time since CP treatment using data extracted from the literature. Results. From 18,293 identified COVID-19 related articles, we included ten studies reporting results of CP treatment for COVID-19 from a total of 61 patients. Decreased symptoms of severe COVID-19 and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were the most direct observations. We found that patients over the age of sixty who received CP treatment for COVID-19 had a significantly prolonged recovery estimated by viral clearance (from 10 to 29 days since first dose of CP) compared to younger patients, who recovered from the infection in less than a week after receiving CP treatment. Conclusions. Limited published results on plasma transfusion treatment for COVID-19 disease with concomitant treatments suggest that CP therapy for COVID-19 is well tolerated and effective. First randomized clinical trial results, however, reveal no improvements in recovery time for elderly patients with severe COVID-19 between standard treatment alone and added with convalescent plasma. Accordingly, we argue that older patients may need a significantly longer time for recovery.

PATIENTS One thousand five hundred and forty-eight subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study who did not have the metabolic syndrome by the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) or International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria at baseline. MEASUREMENTS Waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL). RESULTS After a median interval of 6.4 years, there were 219 and 143 new cases (21.9 and 14.3 per 1000 person-years) of the metabolic syndrome by the NCEP and IDF criteria, respectively. The odds ratio for the NCEP metabolic syndrome was highest for low HDL, 4.08 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.90-5.73] and that for the IDF metabolic syndrome was highest for central obesity, 5.94 [95% CI: 3.98-8.87]. Low HDL, found in 27.8% men and 34.3% women, had the highest sensitivity for the NCEP metabolic syndrome (48% in men and 57% in women) and the IDF metabolic syndrome (41% in men and 54% in women). Central obesity had the highest positive predictive values except that triglycerides had the highest positive predictive value for the NCEP metabolic syndrome in women. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve for waist circumference, triglycerides and HDL were similar. A model that included waist circumference and HDL predicted the metabolic syndrome as well as a model that included all five metabolic syndrome components.

An accurate prognostic model that can be applied to hospitalized patients irrespective of race or COVID-19 status may benefit patient care. RESEARCH DESIGN: This cohort study utilized historical and ongoing electronic health record features to develop and validate a deep-learning model applied on the second day of admission predicting a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or death within 30 days of admission. Model features included patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, inpatient medications, laboratory values, vital signs, and substance use history. Conventional performance metrics were assessed, and subgroup analysis was performed based on race, COVID-19 status, and intensive care unit admission. SUBJECTS: A total of 35,521 patients hospitalized between April 2020 and October 2020 at a single health care system including a tertiary academic referral center and 9 community hospitals. RESULTS: Of 35,521 patients, including 9831 non-White patients and 2020 COVID-19 patients, 2838 (8.0%) met the composite outcome. Patients who experienced the composite outcome were older (73 vs. 61 y old) with similar sex and race distributions between groups. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.88, 0.91) and an average positive predictive value of 0.46 (0.40, 0.52). Model performance did not differ significantly in White (0.89) and non-White (0.90) subgroups or when grouping by COVID-19 status and intensive care unit admission.

Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century.

Thanks to the advent of culture-independent tools, the human body is now known to harbor billions of microbes whose collective genomes work in concert with the human genome. Thus, the human genome can no longer be studied in isolation. Some of these microbes persist by slowing the activity of the vitamin D receptor nuclear receptor, affecting the expression of endogenous antimicrobials and other key components of the innate immune system. It seems that bacteria that cause autoimmune disease accumulate over a lifetime, with individuals picking up pathogens with greater ease over time, as the immune response becomes increasingly compromised. Any one autoimmune disease is likely due to many different microbes within the metagenomic microbiota. This helps explain the high levels of comorbidity observed among patients with autoimmune conditions. What are commonly believed to be autoantibodies may instead be created in response to this metagenomic microbiota when the adaptive immune system is forced to deal with disintegration of infected cells. Similarly, haplotypes associated with autoimmune conditions vary widely among individuals and populations.

The mathematical method used was to explore component similarities and patch them together with a modern geometric statistical projection method called multidimensional scaling (MDS). The comparison looked into similarities between 300 nucleotides (NT) of 7SL RNA and size 300 NT sub-sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA. RN7SL2 and RN7SL3 were also compared with SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA. In the component comparison, use was made of a He Hamiltonian model for the approximation of the density distribution of the outer two electrons. This was considered a basic ingredient of similarity. Improvements can be implemented later on. With MDS it is possible to blend theoretical with experimentally obtained characteristics of components. Furthermore, complementarity was employed to derive a numerical representation of the formation of RNA knots. With the use of crystallographic and electron microscopic coordinate data sets, we aimed to study a more geometric structure of comparing RNA with RNA and RNA with SRP9/14 protein. We found reason to believe that subsequences of the S2 SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA around position NT = 3620, can possibly behave similar to 7SLRNA. The latter can form parasitic Alu DNA. The hypothesis is drawn that under conditions where e.g. broken DNA occurs and RNA dependent DNA polymerase is present these RNA subsequences can, because of similar affinity to SRP9/14, be transformed into transposons and become a DNA parasite.","output":"Approximative He Hamiltonian in descriptive multidimensional scaling statistics of RNA contained information with application to SARS-CoV-2 Spike mRNA and 7SLRNA, RN7SL2 and RN7SL3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to assess the nurses' knowledge, concerns, perceived impact and preparedness toward the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

Methods: A series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears 2 cystine residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with (68)Ga to generate peptide radiotracers ((68)Ga-NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer (68)Ga-NOTA-PEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model. Results: Cyclic DX-600Cderived peptides had markedly lower half-maximal inhibitory concentrations than their linear counterparts. The 3 cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers had calculated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations similar to or lower than the parent DX600 molecule. Peptides were readily labeled with (68)Ga, and the biodistribution of (68)Ga-NOTA-PEP4 was determined in an hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of coadministered NOTA-PEP (blocking) showed a significant reduction of (68)Ga-NOTA-PEP4 signals in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results. Conclusion: NOTA-conjugated cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for (68)Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer, (68)Ga-NOTA-PEP4, showed specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestineorgans known to be affected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that (68)Ga-NOTA-PEP4 could be used to detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2Cinfected murine models and COVID-19 patients.","output":"Cyclic (68)Ga-Labeled Peptides for Specific Detection of Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article positions the 'first female English writer from the Middle Ages', Julian of Norwich (1342-ca 1416), within the context of 'post-scholasticism', the very last period in late Medieval Philosophy, of which one feature was the final separation of theology and philosophy in the late Medieval index Julian should in terms of this placing be engaged as a theologian proper, distinguished from the six other prominent female thinkers from the Medieval Latin West (Heldise, Hildegard, Mechtild, Hadewijch, Marguerite and Catherine), who were all philosopher-theologians However, Julian's epistemology and metaphysics were intertwined with her theology, as presented in her Book of Showings, to such an extent that it is impossible to isolate it from her theological output She is within the socio-historical context of the third wave of the Black Plague in Norwich in 1369 henceforth profiled as a 'post-scholastic theologian' and presented on the basis of prominent theological features in Showings, including its immanent-mystical character (being a presentation of convent theology rather than scholastic theology), its vernacular (Middle English) originality and profound pastoral appeal, its maternal-Christological imagery (Moder Jhesu), its Trinitarian orientation (for the trinitie is god, god is the trinitie) and its deeply eschatological, open-ended engagement with a world devastated by the Plague (alle shalle be wele) Contribution: As a millennium-long discourse, Medieval philosophy functions in a Venn diagrammatical relationship with Medieval history, Church history, patristics and philosophy of religion Whenever 'mainstream' or 'canonised' Medieval philosophy is impacted from specialist research, it may well have implications that these closely related disciplines could take note of Such is the case in this reappraisal of Julian of Norwich' theological and pastoral legacy from its original context of the Black Plague in the 14th century - and indeed within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020","output":"Julian of Norwich (1342-ca.1416) as a post-scholastic theologian"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the effect of how news outlets communicate macroeconomic information to consumers on support for governmental policy in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.

We categorized women as having non-severe (mild or moderate) or severe (severe or critical) COVID-19. We conducted multivariable analyses to identify differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups as risk factors for severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 13 and June 7 2020, 114 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 80.7% (n = 92) had non-severe disease (69 mild, 23 moderate), 15.7% (n = 18) had severe, and 3.5% (n = 4) had critical COVID-19. Women with severe/critical COVID-19 (n = 22) were significantly older (35.0  5.9  31.8  5.1 years, p = 0.011), more likely to have at least one medical comorbidity (81.8%  52.2%, p = .011) or a history of asthma (18.2%  3.3%, p = .025), and tended to have a higher median body mass index (30.1 kg/m2, IQR 28.1-33.9  28.6, IQR 26.2-32.0, p = .056) than women with non-severe disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four factors as independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19: asthma (OR 34.469, 95% CI 1.151-78.030, p = .026), non-white ethnicity (OR 7.932, 95% CI 1.311-47.973, p = .024), maternal age with a best cutoff of &#8805; 34 years (OR 1.195, 95% CI 1.001-1.427, p = .048) and gestational age at diagnosis with a best cut-off of &#8805; 35 weeks (OR 0.876, 95% CI 0.780-0.983, p = .025).

METHODS: Data were obtained from 41 hospitals participating in the prospective Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FITT-STEMI) study, including 15,800 patients treated for acute STEMI from January 2017 to the end of March 2020. RESULTS: There was a 12.6% decrease in the total number of STEMI patients treated at the peak of the pandemic in March 2020 as compared to the mean number treated in the March months of the preceding years. This was accompanied by a significant difference among the modes of admission to hospitals (p = 0.017) with a particular decline in intra-hospital infarctions and transfer patients from other hospitals, while the proportion of patients transported by emergency medical service (EMS) remained stable. In EMS-transported patients, predefined quality indicators, such as percentages of pre-hospital ECGs (both 97%, 95% CI = - 2.2-2.7, p = 0.846), direct transports from the scene to the catheterization laboratory bypassing the emergency department (68% vs. 66%, 95% CI = - 4.9-7.9, p = 0.641), and contact-to-balloon-times of less than or equal to 90 min (58.3% vs. 57.8%, 95%CI = - 6.2-7.2, p = 0.879) were not significantly altered during the COVID-19 crisis, as was in-hospital mortality (9.2% vs. 8.5%, 95% CI = - 3.2-4.5, p = 0.739). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important indicators for STEMI management were unaffected at the peak of COVID-19, suggesting that the pre-existing logistic structure in the regional STEMI networks preserved high-quality standards even when challenged by a threatening pandemic.

This correlates with resistance to restriction mediated by interferon-induced transmembrane protein-2 (IFITM2) and a pronounced infection enhancement by IFITM3. Furthermore, the P681H mutation is necessary for comparative resistance to IFN in a molecularly cloned SARS-CoV-2 encoding alpha Spike.

Although CDC has published COVID-19 guidance for institutions of higher education (2-4), little has been published regarding the response to COVID-19 outbreaks on college and university campuses (5). In August 2020, an Indiana university with approximately 12,000 students (including 8,000 undergraduate students, 85% of whom lived on campus) implemented various public health measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Despite these measures, the university experienced an outbreak involving 371 cases during the first few weeks of the fall semester. The majority of cases occurred among undergraduate students living off campus, and several large off-campus gatherings were identified as common sources of exposure. Rather than sending students home, the university switched from in-person to online instruction for undergraduate students and instituted a series of campus restrictions for 2 weeks, during which testing, contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine programs were substantially enhanced, along with educational efforts highlighting the need for strict adherence to the mitigation measures. After 2 weeks, the university implemented a phased return to in-person instruction (with 85% of classes offered in person) and resumption of student life activities.

The survey examined anthropometric indicators of fat tissue amount in the population of adult males and females from Slovenia from 1950 to 2019. Methods: From a large anthropometric database body height, body mass, seven circumferences (C: waist, hip, relaxed and flexed upper arm, forearm, middle thigh, medial calf) and seven skinfold thicknesses (SFT: triceps, biceps, subscapular, iliac crest, supraspinale, front thigh and medial calf) were obtained in different combinations for more than 3400 males and almost 4600 females of age 18 to 29 years, measured in the years between 1950 and 2019. To evaluate the secular trend, data were classified into 10-year periods and compared with ANOVA. Results: Body mass, waist-to-height ratio, waist-to-hip ratio, waist C, relaxed and flexed upper arm C, calf C, Triceps/subscapular ratio, biceps SFT, supraspinale SFT, front thigh SFT, and medial calf SFT increased (p < 0.001) over the last 70 years, however, thigh C decreased (p < 0.001) over the last 30 years.

In light of an increasing resistance of B. microti to drugs, there is a lack of therapeutic alternatives. Species-specific proteases are essential for parasite survival and possible chemotherapeutic targets. However, the repertoire of proteases in B. microti remains poorly investigated. Herein, we employed several combined bioinformatics tools and strategies to organize and identify genes encoding for the full repertoire of proteases in the B. microti genome. We identified 64 active proteases and 25 nonactive protease homologs.

We aimed to compare the 2D:4D ratio in female Olympic athletes with sedentary controls, and to investigate the 2D:4D ratio in relation to serum and urinary androgens and physical performance in the athletes. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 104 Swedish female Olympic athletes participating in power, endurance and technical sports and 117 sedentary controls. The 2D:4D ratio was calculated using direct digit measurements. Serum androgens and urinary androgen metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The athletes performed standardized physical performance tests and body composition was established by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: The 2D:4D ratio was significantly lower in the athletes compared with controls although serum testosterone levels were comparable between groups and within normal reference values. The 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with urinary levels of testosterone glucuronide and 5&#945;- and 5?Adiol-17G, whereas there were no correlations to serum androgen levels. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio correlated negatively with strength tests and positively with 3,000-meter running in the athletes. Conclusion: Female Olympic athletes had a lower 2D:4D ratio, possibly reflecting a higher prenatal androgen exposure, than sedentary controls. Furthermore, the 2D:4D ratio was related to urinary levels of androgen metabolites and physical performance in the athletes but not to serum androgen levels.

In this study, we have characterized the origin of this wrapping cisterna by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry using lectins, antibodies against endocytic organelles, and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing proteins which behave as Golgi resident proteins. No labelling for endocytic marker proteins could be detected on the wrapping membrane. However, the wrapping membrane labelled significantly for a trans Golgi network (TGN) marker protein. The recycling pathway from endosomes to the TGN appears to be greatly increased following vaccinia virus infection, since significant amounts of endocytic fluid-phase tracers were found in the lumen of the TGN, Golgi complex, and the wrapping cisternae. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we localized the vaccinia virus membrane proteins VV-p37, VV-p42, VV-p21, and VV-hemagglutinin (VV-HA) in large amounts in the wrapping cisternae, in the outer membranes of the IEV, and in the outermost membrane of the EEV. The bulk of the cellular VV-p37, VV-p21, and VV-p42 were in the TGN, whereas VV-HA was also found in large amounts on the plasma membrane and in endosomes. Collectively, these data argue that the TGN becomes enriched in vaccinia virus membrane proteins that facilitate the wrapping event responsible for the formation of the IEV.","output":"Assembly of vaccinia virus: the second wrapping cisterna is derived from the trans Golgi network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

Here, we present the national-level burden of COVID-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Input data were collected from official records or published literature. The proportion of excess COVID-19 deaths was estimated using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Washington data. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to COVID-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). YLL was estimated by multiplying the number of deaths due to COVID-19 by the residual standard life expectancy at the age of death due to the disease. YLD was calculated as a product of the number of incident cases of COVID-19, disease duration and disability weight.

Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles reduces systemic toxicity and increases circulation time of the drugs. In a novel approach to microbubble-assisted drug delivery, nanoparticles are incorporated in or on microbubble shells, enabling local and triggered release of the nanoparticle payload with ultrasound. A thorough understanding of the release mechanisms within the vast ultrasound parameter space is crucial for efficient and controlled release. This set of presented protocols is applicable to microbubbles with a shell containing a fluorescent label. Here, the focus is on microbubbles loaded with poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) polymeric nanoparticles, doped with a modified Nile Red dye. The particles are fixed within a denatured casein shell. The microbubbles are produced by vigorous stirring, forming a dispersion of perfluoropropane gas in the liquid phase containing casein and nanoparticles, after which the microbubble shell self-assembles. A variety of microscopy techniques are needed to characterize the nanoparticle-stabilized microbubbles at all relevant timescales of the nanoparticle release process. Fluorescence of the nanoparticles enables confocal imaging of single microbubbles, revealing the particle distribution within the shell. In vitro ultra-high-speed imaging using bright-field microscopy at 10 million frames per second provides insight into the bubble dynamics in response to ultrasound insonation. Finally, nanoparticle release from the bubble shell is best visualized by means of fluorescence microscopy, performed at 500,000 frames per second. To characterize drug delivery in vivo, the triggered release of nanoparticles within the vasculature and their extravasation beyond the endothelial layer is studied using intravital microscopy in tumors implanted in dorsal skinfold window chambers, over a timescale of several minutes.

The numerous outbreaks that have occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are putting a demand on researchers to develop approaches capable of both predicting contagion in closed environments (predictive assessment) and analyzing previous infections (retrospective assessment). This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The application of a Monte Carlo method allowed the risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable risk of 10(-3) for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time could be well below one hour. Such maximum exposure time clearly depends on the viral load emission of the infected subject and on the exposure conditions; thus, longer exposure times were estimated for mechanically ventilated indoor environments and lower viral load emissions. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we show that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a superspreading event.","output":"Quantitative assessment of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection: prospective and retrospective applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the draconian measures applied to limit its spread have accelerated the process of digitalizing many activities, including those within the health sector.

METHODS: A total of 40 iNPH patients and 41 elderly acquired hydrocephalus patients and 26 age-matched healthy volunteers in the normal control (NC) group were included between November 2017 and October 2019 in this retrospective study. The following CSF flow parameters were measured with PC-MR: peak velocity, average velocity (AV), aqueductal stroke volume (ASV), net ASV, and net flow. The following ventricular volume parameters were measured: ventricular volume (VV), brain volume, total intracranial volume, and relative VV. Differences between the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were compared MannCWhitney U test and correlations between CSF flow and ventricular volume parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Aqueductal stroke volume was significantly higher in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups than in the NC group, but did not differ significantly between the iNPH group and acquired hydrocephalus group. The AV, net ASV, and net flow in the iNPH and acquired hydrocephalus groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P < 0.0001), and those in the acquired hydrocephalus group were significantly higher than those in the iNPH group (P = 0.01, P = 0.007, P = 0.002, respectively). The direction of the AV and net ASV significantly differed among the three groups. There were no associations between the volume parameters and CSF flow according to PC-MR among the three groups.

Ozone is a harmful pollutant and is responsible for many health issues. However, some reports suggest that ozone is a strong disinfectant, and can kill the viruses. We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India. The data obtained from this study advances the fundamental understanding of ozone chemistry that may lead to improved ozone parameterization in chemical transport models and better planning of ozone risk management strategies for any global mega cities.","output":"Anomalous Behaviour of Ozone under COVID-19 and Explicit Diagnosis of O3-NOx-VOCs Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Spains health budget. METHODS: Budget impact analyses based on retrospective data from patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) admitted to a Spanish hospital between February 26 and May 21, 2020. Direct medical costs from the perspective of the hospital were calculated. We analyzed diagnostic tests, drugs, medical and nursing care, and isolation ward and ICU stays for three cohorts: patients seen in the emergency room only, hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and patients who tested negative. RESULTS: The impact on the hospitals budget for the 3 months was calculated at 15,633,180, 97.4% of which was related to health care and hospitalization. ICU stays accounted for 5.3% of the total costs. The mean cost per patient was 10,744. The main costs were staffing costs (10,131 to 11,357 /patient for physicians and 10,274 to 11,215 /patient for nurses). Scenario analysis showed that the range of hospital expenditure was between 14,693,256 and 16,524,924. The median impact of the pandemic on the Spanish health budget in the sensitivity analysis using bootstrapped individual data was 9357 million (interquartile range [IQR], 9071 to 9689) for the conservative scenario (113,588 hospital admissions and 11,664 ICU admissions) and 10,385 million (IQR, 110,030 to 10,758) for the worst-case scenario (including suspected cases). CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on the Spanish public health budget (12.3% of total public health expenditure) is greater than multiple sclerosis, cancer and diabetes cost.

The purpose of this study is to present a contextual, theoretical, and empirical rationale for an intervention, aiming to promote continued engagement in outdoor recreation for older adults in a Swedish context. METHODS: The paper includes a contextualization of outdoor recreation in Sweden, a presentation of evidence on health benefits related to engagement in outdoor recreation, together with theoretical frameworks that may guide future intervention designs. To add empirical knowledge, a mixed methods approach was applied, including an empirical data collection based on a quantitative survey (n = 266) and individual semi-structured interviews with older adults (n = 12). Survey data were presented with descriptive statistics. Associations between disengagement from previously performed activities and age and gender was analyzed with Chi(2) tests. Transcripts and handwritten notes from the interviews were analyzed qualitatively to identify key themes, as well as patterns and disparities among respondents. RESULTS: Outdoor recreation was rated as important/very important by 90% of respondents of the survey. The interviews highlighted that engagement in outdoor recreation aided respondents to keep fit but had also relevance in terms of identity, experiences, and daily routines. Outdoor recreation close to the place of residence was most common and walking was the most frequently reported activity. While 80% considered their health to be good/very good, disability and long-term diseases were common and during the previous year, more than half of all respondents had disengaged from activities previously performed. Reasons for disengagement were mainly related to health decline or that activities were too demanding but also due to social loss. The interviews indicated that continued engagement was important but challenging, and that disengagement could be considered as a loss or accepted due to changing circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: In the design of an intervention aiming to promote engagement in outdoor recreation for older adults, the following features are proposed to be considered: person-centeredness, promoting functioning, addressing self-ageism, providing environmental support, promoting subjective mobility needs and adaptation to find new ways to engage in outdoor recreation.","output":"Promoting outdoor recreation among older adults in Sweden C a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development of an intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A few ideas that deserve to see the light of day.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we retrospectively analyzed 335 COVID-19 patients (median: 56.0; IQR: 43.0-64.0 y) who were admitted to the Wuhan Tongji Hospital between 27 February and 21 March 2020. We also included an age- and sex-matched population of 560 individuals (median: 55; IQR: 49.0-60.0 y) who underwent the physical examination program. Their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured during the same period from 2018-2019. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured for all COVID-19 patients on admission. Severity of COVID-19 was determined based on the level of respiratory involvement. A general linear model with adjustment for covariates was used to compare 25(OH)D concentrations between the COVID-19 and 2018-2019 control groups. Adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for associations between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity were estimated via multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: In the general linear model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and BMI, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients than the 2018-2019 controls [ln transformed values of 3.32  0.04 vs. 3.46  0.022 ln (nmol/L), P = 0.014].

However, toxicological effects associated with inhibition of thiol-containing enzymes, such as the -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (-AlaD), have been described. The molecular mechanism(s) by which they inhibit thiol-containing enzymes at the atomic level, is still not well known. The use of computational methods to understand the physical-chemical properties and biological activity of chemicals is essential to the rational design of new drugs. In this work, we propose an in silico study to understand the -AlaD inhibition mechanism by diphenyl diselenide (DPDS) and its putative metabolite, phenylseleninic acid (PSA), using -AlaD enzymes from Homo sapiens (Hs-AlaD), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-AlaD) and Cucumis sativus (Cs-AlaD). Protein modeling homology, molecular docking, and DFT calculations are combined in this study. According to the molecular docking, DPDS and PSA might bind in the Hs-AlaD and Dm-AlaD active sites interacting with the cysteine residues by Se()S interactions. On the other hand, the DPDS does not access the active site of the Cs-AlaD (a non-thiol protein), while the PSA interacts with the amino acids residues from the active site, such as the Lys291. These interactions might lead to the formation of a covalent bond, and consequently, to the enzyme inhibition. In fact, DFT calculations (mPW1PW91/def2TZVP) demonstrated that the selenylamide bond formation is energetically favored. The in silico data showed here are in accordance with previous experimental studies, and help us to understand the reactivity and biological activity of organoselenium compounds.","output":"The Se S/N interactions as a possible mechanism of -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase enzyme inhibition by organoselenium compounds: a computational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This paper looks into the impact of the recent COVID-19 epidemic on the daily mobility of people Existing research into the epidemic travel patterns points at transport as a channel for disease spreading with especially long-distance travel in the centre of interest We adopt a different approach looking into the effects that epidemic has on the transport system and specifically in relation to short-distance daily mobility activities We go beyond simple travel avoidance behaviours and look into factors influencing change in travel times and in modal split under epidemic This leads to the research problems we posit in this paper We look into the overall reduction of daily travel and into the factors impacting peoples' decisions to refrain from daily traveling This paper focuses on modes affected and explores differences between various societal groups Methods We use a CATI survey with a representative sample size of 1069 respondents from Poland The survey was carried out between March, 24th and April, 6th 2020, with a start date one week after the Polish government introduced administrative measures aimed at slowing down the COVID-19 epidemic For data analysis, we propose using the GLM (general linear model), allowing us to include all the qualitative and quantitative variables which depict our sample Results We observe significant drops in travel times under epidemic conditions Those drops are similar regardless of the age group and gender The time decrease depended on the purpose of travels, means of transport, traveller's household size, fear of coronavirus, main occupation, and change in it caused by the epidemic The more the respondent was afraid of coronavirus, the more she or he shortened the travel time","output":"Lockdowned: Everyday mobility changes in response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with millions infected and more than 1 million fatalities.

A short film has been produced intended for public and professional audiences featuring academics, representatives of advocacy organisations, police and policymakers outlining the problems with, and highlighting alternative approaches to, UK drug policy. A range of ethical arguments are alluded to, which are distilled here in greater depth for interested viewers and a wider professional and academic readership. MAIN BODY: The war on drugs is seemingly driven by the idea that the consumption of illegal drugs is immoral. However, the meaning ascribed to drug in the illicit sense encompasses a vast range of substances with different properties that have as much in common with legal drugs as they do with each other. The only property that distinguishes illegal from legal drugs is their legal status, which rather than being based on an assessment of how dangerous they are has been defined by centuries of socio-political idiosyncrasies. The consequences of criminalising people who use drugs often outweigh the risks they face from drug use, and there is not convincing evidence that this prevents wider drug use or drug-related harm. Additionally, punishing someone as a means, to the end of deterring others from drug use, is ethically problematic. Although criminalising the production of harmful drugs may seem more ethically tenable, it has not reduced the supply of drugs and it precludes effective regulation of the market. Other potential policy approaches are highlighted, which would be ethically preferable to existing punitive policy. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to eliminate all drug use and associated harms. The current approach is not only ineffective in preventing drug-related harm but itself directly and indirectly causes incalculable harm to those who use drugs and to wider society. For policymakers to gain the mandate to rationalise drug policy, or to be held accountable if they do not, wider engagement with the electorate is required. It is hoped that this film will encourage at least a few to give pause and reflect on how drug policy might be improved.","output":"An ethical analysis of UK drug policy as an example of a criminal justice approach to drugs: a commentary on the short film Putting UK Drug Policy into Focus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led many people to suffer from emotional distress.

Our loci provided the necessary power to distinguish among all the genotyped pangolins, tracing the dispatch of same individuals on the markets and within local communities. We developed an approach combining rarefaction analysis of private allele frequencies and cross-validation with observed data that could trace five traded pangolins to their forest origin, c. 200-300 km away from the markets. Although the genetic toolkit that we designed from traditional markers can prove helpful to trace the pangolin trade, our tracing ability was limited by the lack of population structure within DGL. Given the deleterious combination of genetic, demographic and trade-related factors affecting DGL populations, the conservation status of white-bellied pangolins in the DG should be urgently re-evaluated.","output":"Can DNA help trace the local trade of pangolins?

This study examined the feasibility and preliminary, short-term effects of a theory-based intervention aimed at reducing total and prolonged sedentary behaviour in University students. Design: A quasi-experimental (pre-post) pilot study. Methods: Nine ambulatory undergraduate students (Mean age = 22  2.32) participated in a one-on-one session, including an educational component around the health effects of sedentary behaviour and three distinct activities (feedback, pros and cons exercise, and suggested behaviour change strategies). In addition, automated daily text messages targeting sedentary behaviour were sent for 6 days (four messages per day at fixed intervals). The Behaviour Change Wheel framework guided the intervention design process. Outcomes were assessed over 6 days in pre- and post-intervention periods and included accelerometer-based (activPAL) and self-reported (Nightly-Week-U) total sedentary time, as well as accelerometer-based number of steps and prolonged sedentary time. Students completed a process evaluation interview upon completing the trial. Results: From pre- to post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in accelerometer-based total and prolonged sedentary time during weekend days. In addition, there was a significant increase in accelerometer-based standing time and stepping during weekend days. There were no statistically significant changes in accelerometer-based sedentary time, standing time or number of steps during weekdays. Process evaluation results indicated that the intervention and its assessment is feasible. Reductions in sedentary time were likely to be mediated by positive changes in the student's reflective and automatic motivation. Conclusions: Findings from this small, short-term intervention suggest that a single one-on-one session, together with automated text messages, may help University students reduce sedentary behaviour and enhance movement during weekend days. Additional strategies to maximise the intervention effects are discussed (e.g., establishing a collaboration with University staff, introducing sit-to-stand desks, and/or facilitating social support). A randomised control trial assessing sedentary behaviour over a longer period is needed to adequately study the intervention's effectiveness.","output":"Feasibility of Reducing and Breaking Up University Students' Sedentary Behaviour: Pilot Trial and Process Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The purpose of this editorial is to provide guidance for the readers concerning the broad realm of approaches towards successful implementation of digital health applications into the health care system. Recent developments due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic are used as a current angle. SUBJECT AND METHODS: All contributions within the special issue were scanned for their most decisive contribution to the special issue and the field of implementation science, with a focus on digital health. Micro, meso, and macro layers of implementation processes, as well as the technological perspective itself, are used as broad categories for sorting the contributions and structuring the special issue. RESULTS: The ten contributions to this special issue cover micro (n = 1), technology (n = 1), meso (n = 4) and macro (n = 2) perspectives on the implementation process of digital health applications. Two further contributions also tackle the issue from a wider perspective when aiming to structure telemedicine application types and barriers encountered when implementing digital health. CONCLUSION: Considering the wide array of research fields represented in this special issue, an emphasis is put on the importance of interdisciplinary work required for tackling the scale-up problem of digital health. As such, the special issue can assist in leveraging the full potential of digital health, not only when dealing with situations as out-of-the-ordinary as the current pandemic but also well beyond that, for example when dealing with the upcoming challenges of demographic change.","output":"Tackling the scaling-up problem of digital health applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We document and evaluate how businesses are reacting to the COVID-19 crisis through August 2020. First, on net, firms see the shock (thus far) largely as a demand rather than supply shock. A greater share of firms report significant or severe disruptions to sales activity than to supply chains. We compare these measures of disruption to their expected changes in selling prices and find that, even for firms that report supply chain disruptions, they expect to lower near-term selling prices on average. We also show that firms are engaging in wage cuts and expect to trim wages further before the end of 2020. These cuts stem from firms that have been disproportionally negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second, firms (like professional forecasters) have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by lowering their one-year-ahead inflation expectations. These responses stand in stark contrast to that of household inflation expectations (as measured by the University of Michigan or the New York Fed). Indeed, firms one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell precipitously (to a series low) following the onset of the pandemic, while household measures of inflation expectations jumped markedly. Third, despite the dramatic decline in firms near-term inflation expectations, their longer-run inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business expectations()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) is the kingpin of Indian economy.

The study aims to analyse the impact of financial and non-financial measures for the revival of MSME and its impact on firm sustainability and future opportunity as perceived by MSME owners/heads during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach This study, based on a cross-sectional survey of 197 export-oriented Indian MSMEs, attempts to investigate covid crisis mitigation strategies/measures in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was applied to check model fit, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. Findings The results of this study show the financial and non-financial revival measures such as firm revival, marketing training, customer relationship management (CRM), financial incentive and firm support, extending worker social security and financial access and price control positively impact MSMEs' business sustainability and future opportunity as perceived by the respondents that lent good support to the hypothesis.

AIM: To explore the associations between the COVID-19 incidence and malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty, identified as potential risk factors in previous cross-sectional studies. METHODS: Malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty were assessed at the last available follow-up from the Sarcopenia and Physical Impairments with Advancing Age (SarcoPhAge) cohort (i.e., the fifth year that ended in 2019) according to the Mini-Nutritional Assessment short-form, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2), and the Fried criteria, respectively. Information regarding the COVID-19 was gathered by phone calls interviews in April 2021 to measure its self-declared incidence. Adjusted Cox regressions and KaplanCMeier curves were performed. RESULTS: The present study included 241 participants [median age 75.6 (73.0C80.6) years, 63.1% women]. Among them, 27 participants (11.2%) developed the non-fatal Covid-19. No significant increased risks of COVID-19 were observed in patients with malnutrition [adjusted HR 1.14 (0.26C5.07)] and sarcopenia [adjusted HR 1.25 (0.35C4.42)]. Nevertheless, the incidence of COVID-19 was significantly higher in frail (44.4%) than in robust participants (8.5%) [Adjusted HR 7.01 (2.69C18.25)], which was confirmed by the KaplanCMeier curves (p < 0.001). Among the frailty syndrome components, a low physical activity level was the only one significantly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 [adjusted HR 5.18 (1.37C19.54)]. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations in the methodology of this study (i.e., limited sample size, COVID-19 incidence self-reported and not assessed systematically using objective measurements) requiring careful consideration, an increased risk to develop COVID-19 was observed in the presence of the frailty syndrome.

We discuss this vulnerability among LTCF residents using an ecological framework, on levels spanning from the individual to families and caregivers, institutions, health services and systems, communities, and contextual government policies. Challenges abound for fully understanding the burden of COVID-19 in LTCF, including differences in nomenclature, data collection systems, cultural differences, varied social welfare models, and (often) under-resourcing of the LTC sector. Registration of cases and deaths may be limited by testing capacity and policy, record-keeping and reporting procedures. Hospitalization and death rates may be inaccurate depending on atypical presentations and whether or not residents' goals of care include escalation of care and transfer to hospital. Given the important contribution of frailty, use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is discussed as a readily implementable measure, as are lessons learned from the study of frailty in relation to influenza. Biomarkers hold emerging promise in helping to predict disease severity and address the puzzle of why some frail LTCF residents are resilient to COVID-19, either remaining test-negative despite exposure or having asymptomatic infection, while others experience the full range of illness severity including critical illness and death. Strong and coordinated surveillance and research focused on LTCFs and their frail residents is required.

RESULTS: A total of 210 patients and 71 HCWs were sampled. One hundred and three (53.8%) patients had some knowledge of HAIs with 52 (28.4%) being informed by a HCW compared with 63 (88.7%) of HCWs who were well informed about HAIs. Ninety-seven (46.2%) responding patient always washed their hands while 65 (31%) and 48 (22.9%) respectively sometimes or never washed their hands within or after leaving the hospital. Out of those who washed their hands, 64 (39.5%) always washed with soap while 46 (28.4%) did sometimes. This positively and significantly correlated (r=0.440, P<0.001) with knowledge on HAIs which was however insignificant in HCWs (r=0.025, P=0.835).

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the mediating roles of self\\\\efficacy and resilience between stress and both physical and mental quality\\\\of\\\\life components in intensive care nurses during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross\\\\sectional survey design. METHODS: The stress subscale (depression, anxiety, and stress scale in Spanish Scale, DASS\\\\21), the summary components (physical and mental) of health\\\\related quality of life (SF\\\\36), the general self\\\\efficacy scale (GSES), and the resilience scale (RS\\\\14) were administered in 308 intensive care nurses. Serial multiple mediator models were used. RESULTS: There was a significant indirect effect of levels of perceived stress on both physical and mental health components through self\\\\efficacy and resilience. Specifically, greater perception of self\\\\efficacy was associated with a lower perception of stress and greater resilience, while higher resilience was associated with greater physical and mental health (B = ?0.03; SE = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [?0.07, ?0.01]; B = ?0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI = [?0.07, ?0.01], respectively).

Family members are synthesized and secreted as pro-complexes of non-covalently associated prodomains and growth factors (GF). Pro-complexes from a subset of family members are latent and require activation steps to release the GF for signaling. Why some members are latent while others are non-latent is incompletely understood, particularly because of large family diversity. Here, we have examined representative family members in negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) and hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) to identify features that differentiate latent from non-latent members. nsEM showed three overall pro-complex conformations that differed in prodomain arm domain orientation relative to the bound growth factor. Two cross-armed members, TGF-1 and TGF-2, were each latent. However, among V-armed members, GDF8 was latent whereas ActA was not. All open-armed members, BMP7, BMP9, and BMP10, were non-latent. Family members exhibited remarkably varying HDX patterns, consistent with large prodomain sequence divergence. A strong correlation emerged between latency and protection of the prodomain 1-helix from exchange. Furthermore, latency and protection from exchange correlated structurally with increased 1-helix buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, and cation-pi bonds. Moreover, a specific pattern of conserved basic and hydrophobic residues in the 1-helix and aromatic residues in the interacting fastener were found only in latent members. Thus, this first comparative survey of TGF- family members reveals not only diversity in conformation and dynamics but also unique features that distinguish latent members.","output":"Protection of the prodomain 1-helix correlates with latency in the transforming growth factor- family."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implant-based breast reconstruction is the most popular reconstruction option following mastectomy.

In addition to the burden of excessively involving surgical staff, this may lead to reduced image stability, increased task completion time and sometimes errors due to the monotony of the task. Robotic endoscope holders, controlled by a set of basic instructions, have been proposed as an alternative, but their unnatural handling may increase the cognitive load of the (solo) surgeon, which hinders their clinical acceptance. More seamless integration in the surgical workflow would be achieved if robotic endoscope holders collaborated with the operating surgeon via semantically rich instructions that closely resemble instructions that would otherwise be issued to a human camera assistant, such as\\"focus on my right-hand instrument\\". As a proof of concept, this paper presents a novel system that paves the way towards a synergistic interaction between surgeons and robotic endoscope holders. The proposed platform allows the surgeon to perform a bimanual coordination and navigation task, while a robotic arm autonomously performs the endoscope positioning tasks. Within our system, we propose a novel tooltip localization method based on surgical tool segmentation and a novel visual servoing approach that ensures smooth and appropriate motion of the endoscope camera. We validate our vision pipeline and run a user study of this system. The clinical relevance of the study is ensured through the use of a laparoscopic exercise validated by the European Academy of Gynaecological Surgery which involves bi-manual coordination and navigation.

RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 48 (20.4%) presented with delirium, which was hypoactive in 41.6% of cases, hyperactive and mixed in 35.4% and 23.0%, respectively. Patients with cognitive impairment had a nearly four times higher risk of developing delirium compared to patients that were cognitively normal before SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 3.7; 1.7-7.9 95% CI, p=0.001). The presence of delirium did not modify the time from symptoms' onset to hospitalization nor the length of stay in acute care, but it was associated with an increased risk of dying (HR 2.1; 1.2-3.7 95%CI; p=0.0113). CONCLUSION: Delirium was a prevalent condition in older people admitted with COVID-19 and pre-existing cognitive impairment was its main risk factor. Delirium was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. These results highlight the importance of early recognition of delirium especially when pre-morbid cognitive comorbidities are present.","output":"Delirium in older patients with COVID-19: prevalence, risk factors and clinical relevance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among all the groups and occupations that have been affected by the global pandemic, nursing professionals stand out as having been particularly hard-pressed due to the dramatic increase in the need for their services. Given the rising tide of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who require specialized medical treatment as well as the millions of others that are lining up for vaccinations, it can be assumed that many nursing professionals have had to endure such things as longer working hours, tighter schedules, and the intensity of a work environment in which failure of care and multiple deaths are the daily fare. This article proposes that nurses can avoid such severe consequences by taking up a regime of enhanced self-care management that enables them to achieve psychophysical balance and wellness. Three practices are highlighted in this regard: prayer, meditative walking, and the mindfulness practice of body scanning. Our suggestion is that these coping strategies will be both beneficial and healthful for nursing professionals in terms of enhancing their spiritual/existential resilience and meeting their own need for consolation as they navigate in an extremely difficult and demanding work environment.","output":"Spiritual Self-Care Management for Nursing Professionals: A Holistic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health and social crisis linked to the COVID-19 shows the limits of a welfare state that is concerned to include care in its actions and struggles to invest in preventive public policies.

These patients had follow-up after an initial in-person evaluation. We designed this retrospective case series to describe the diagnostic categories seen through telehealth, management steps completed during video visits, and to understand whether additional in-person care was required within 90 days of video visits. In addition, we estimated time and cost savings for patients attributed to video visits. RESULTS: Most men seen during video visits had an endocrinologic (29%) or anatomic (21%) cause for their infertility. 73% of video visits involved reviewing results; 30% included counseling regarding assistive reproductive technologies; and 25% of video visits resulted in prescribing hormonally active medications. The two patients (3%) who were seen in clinic after their video visit underwent a varicocelectomy in the interim. No patients required an unplanned in-person visit. From a patient perspective, video visits were estimated to save a median of 97 minutes (IQR 64-250) of travel per visit. Median cost savings per patient- by avoiding travel and taking time off work for a clinic visit-were estimated to range from $149 (half day off) to $252 (full day off).

However, there is an existing controversy, over when and if a free flap is needed during complex skull reconstruction (ie, cranioplasty). As such the authors present here our experience using full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) to cover local defects following scalp adjacent tissue transfer in the setting of cranioplasty. METHODS By way of an institutional review board-approved database, the authors identified patients treated over a 3-year period spanning January 2015 to December 2017, who underwent scalp reconstruction using the technique presented here. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, technical details, outcomes, and long-term follow up were statistically analyzed for the purpose of this study. RESULTS Thirty-three patients, who underwent combined cranioplasty and scalp reconstruction using an FTSG for local donor site coverage, were identified. Twenty-five (75%) patients were considered to have \\"high complexity\\" scalp defects prior to reconstruction. Of them, 12 patients (36%) were large-sized and 20 (60%) medium-sized; 21 (64%) grafts were inset over vascularized muscle or pericranium while the remaining grafts were placed over bare calvarial bone. In total, the authors found 94% (31/33) success for all FTSGs in this cohort. Two of the skin grafts failed due to unsuccessful take. Owing to the high rate of success in this series, none of the patient's risk factors were found to correlate with graft failure. In addition, the success rate did not differ whether the graft was placed over bone verses over vascularized muscle/pericranium. CONCLUSION In contrary to previous studies that have reported inconsistent success with full-thickness skin grafting in this setting, the authors present a simple technique with consistent results-as compared to other more complex reconstructive methods-even in the setting of highly complex scalp reconstruction and simultaneous cranioplasty.","output":"Full-Thickness Skin Grafting for Local Defect Coverage Following Scalp Adjacent Tissue Transfer in the Setting of Cranioplasty."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physician-scientists comprise a unique and valuable part of the biomedical workforce, but for decades there has been concern about the number of physicians actively engaged in research.

We aimed to describe changes in adherence to recommendations for physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep duration over the first two waves of the pandemic (March-May 2020 and October 2020-January 2021) in Switzerland, and to assess the associations of these lifestyle behaviours with life satisfaction and overall health, as indicators of well-being. MethodsWe included 3168 participants aged 5 to 18 years from four Swiss cantons. Participants or their parents completed repeated questionnaires and reported on their (childs) PA, ST, sleep, life satisfaction, and overall health. We analysed lifestyle behaviours in terms of adherence to international recommendations. We used linear and logistic regression models to assess the associations of number of recommendations met and adherence patterns with well-being indicators. FindingsCompared to the pre-pandemic period, the percentage of participants meeting the recommendations for PA and ST decreased strikingly during March-May 2020, while there was a slight increase in those meeting recommendations for sleep. During October 2020-January 2021, the percentage of compliant children for PA and ST increased but remained lower than before the pandemic. Participants meeting all three recommendations were more likely to report excellent health (OR: 1{middle dot}87 [1{middle dot}15-3{middle dot}08]) and a higher life satisfaction score ({beta}: 0{middle dot}59 [0{middle dot}30-0{middle dot}88]) than participants not meeting any recommendation. Adherence to recommendations for PA and sleep, PA and ST, and sleep and ST was similarly associated with both well-being indicators. InterpretationWe show a substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrens and adolescents lifestyle behaviours with a partial recovery over time, and an association between lifestyle and well-being. Public health policies to promote childrens and adolescents well-being should target PA, ST, and sleep simultaneously. FundingCorona Immunitas. RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies assessing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on childrens and adolescents lifestyle behaviours, published up to September 6, 2021, with no language restrictions. Of the studies found, nearly all compared lifestyle behaviours before and during the strict confinement in the first wave of the pandemic, and very few studies extended their assessment beyond June 2020. The only longitudinal study assessing lifestyle changes up to 2021 included a sample of nineteen boys. Some studies assessed the association between lifestyle behaviours and well-being after the outbreak of the pandemic, but all used a single-behaviour approach (i.e., evaluated only one lifestyle behaviour) and no study considered the combined contribution of physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), and sleep. In addition, most studies were cross-sectional and did not consider pre-pandemic lifestyle behaviours. Added value of this studyThis is the first study assessing changes in adherence to international recommendations regarding PA, ST, and sleep duration in children and adolescents during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the joint associations of these lifestyle behaviours with well-being. We used data from 3168 children and adolescents from four different Swiss cantons. We included measurements of PA, ST, and sleep before the pandemic, during the first wave between March and May 2020, and during the second wave between October 2020 and January 2021. We also assessed life satisfaction and overall health as indicators of well-being, between January and April 2021. We showed that, compared to the pre-pandemic period, the proportion of children and adolescents following the recommendations for PA and ST decreased during the first wave (lockdown period), while there was a slight increase in those meeting recommendations for sleep. During the second wave, the prevalence of compliant children and adolescents for PA and ST recovered but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we found an association between the number of recommendations met for lifestyle behaviours during the second wave and well-being assessed between January and April 2021. In contrast, there was no such association for the periods before the pandemic or during the lockdown. Participants following the recommendations for all three lifestyle behaviours or for combinations of two of them in the second wave were more likely to report excellent health and had a higher life satisfaction score, than those not meeting any recommendation. Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong negative effect on childrens and adolescents lifestyle behaviours, but some recovery has taken place within the first year since the outbreak. Policymakers should imperatively consider the balance of disease prevention and promotion of a healthy lifestyle when (re-)activating restrictive measures. Given the already high prevalence of children and adolescents not meeting lifestyle recommendations in the pre-pandemic period, our findings highlight the urgent need for public health policies aiming to avoid permanent negative changes on childrens and adolescents lifestyle and to mitigate the health risks associated with adverse changes during the pandemic. In addition, our study indicates that lifestyle is an important predictor of childrens and adolescents well-being, and it further suggests that future public health strategies aiming to promote well-being should target sufficient time for PA and sleep as well as reduce ST.","output":"Lifestyle behaviours of children and adolescents during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland and their relation to well-being: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recognition of pathogen or cancer-specific epitopes by CD8+ T cells is crucial for the clearance of infections and the response to cancer immunotherapy.

Similar to the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of SARS-CoV that inhibits host gene expression at the translational level, we report that MERS-CoV nsp1 also exhibits a conserved function to negatively regulate host gene expression by inhibiting host mRNA translation and inducing the degradation of host mRNAs. Furthermore, like SARS-CoV nsp1, the mRNA degradation activity of MERS-CoV nsp1, most probably triggered by its ability to induce an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage, was separable from its translation inhibitory function. Despite these functional similarities, MERS-CoV nsp1 used a strikingly different strategy that selectively targeted translationally competent host mRNAs for inhibition. While SARS-CoV nsp1 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit to gain access to translating mRNAs, MERS-CoV nsp1 was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and did not bind stably to the 40S subunit, suggesting a distinctly different mode of targeting translating mRNAs. Interestingly, consistent with this notion, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targeted mRNAs, which are transcribed in the nucleus and transported to the cytoplasm, for translation inhibition and mRNA degradation but spared exogenous mRNAs introduced directly into the cytoplasm or virus-like mRNAs that originate in the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data point toward a novel viral strategy wherein the cytoplasmic origin of MERS-CoV mRNAs facilitates their escape from the inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV nsp1. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic human CoV that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV has a zoonotic origin and poses a major threat to public health. However, little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high virulence of MERS-CoV. Many animal viruses, including CoVs, encode proteins that interfere with host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral immune responses, and these viral proteins are often major virulence factors. The nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of CoVs is one such protein that inhibits host gene expression and is a major virulence factor. This study presents evidence for a strategy used by MERS-CoV nsp1 to inhibit host gene expression that has not been described previously for any viral protein. The present study represents a meaningful step toward a better understanding of the factors and molecular mechanisms governing the virulence and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV.","output":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus nsp1 Inhibits Host Gene Expression by Selectively Targeting mRNAs Transcribed in the Nucleus while Sparing mRNAs of Cytoplasmic Origin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we describe a machine vision Neural Net al.gorithm implemented in a FPGA.

The individuals of the low-risk group received rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops for one month in addition to first level protection, and the high-risk group received a combination of rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops coupled with thymosin-&#945;1 with either second or third-level protection protocol. Moreover, the new-outset of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT), after thirty days, was the primary outcome. The adverse reactions were recorded in all participants. RESULTS: 2415 of 2944 individuals belonged to the low-risk group, while 529 to the high-risk group. There was no COVID-19 pneumonia in either of the group after thirty days. The pulmonary CT scans were negative for COVID-19 pneumonia in both the groups with no new clinical symptoms. No serious adverse event was observed during the course of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops along with augmented safeguards based on standard physical isolation could effectively protect medical staff against COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"The Effect of Recombinant Human Interferon Alpha Nasal Drops to Prevent COVID-19 Pneumonia for Medical Staff in an Epidemic Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a previous study, two murine T-cell hybridomas generated after immunization with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were shown to be responsive to the internally localized viral nucleocapsid protein.

This case is made because too many children are not receiving the mental health care they need in order to succeed in school and life. This is especially true for Black, Indigenous, children of color, and other minoritized youth. This transformative approach will require a dramatic change in how school psychological services are currently being delivered. The culturally responsible dual-factor model places a much greater emphasis on psychological well-being (as opposed to psychopathology), unwavering attention to rectifying discriminatory disparities in school mental health practices, an emphasis on population-based over individually focused mental health services, and a commitment to ensuring access for all children-not just those who are receiving special education services or 504 accommodations. This model is proactive and prevention oriented and focuses on equity. The case is presented that we continue to have a mental health crisis in today's youth with an increase in anxiety and depression. The authors conclude the article with implications for school psychology training, public policy and advocacy, and school-based practice. Impact Statement The culturally responsible dual-factor mental health framework is a transformative approach to school mental health services that is needed to address the nation's mental health crisis. It is needed because traditional approaches, models, and practices have been too narrow and, thus, continue to fail for diverse and minoritized children, families, and schools. A culturally responsible dual-factor mental health approach expands traditional approaches by emphasizing well-being, cultural strengths of minoritized communities, accessibility of services, and systems and structures (e.g., racism) that contribute to discrimination and disparities in mental health services.","output":"Transforming School Mental Health Services Based on a Culturally Responsible Dual-Factor Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus has turned human life upside down globally.

Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child health), the antimicrobial resistant bacteria considered to be clinically most important for human health and earmarked for surveillance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant bacteria, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B -resistant vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). If these bacteria are carried in the female genital tract, they may be transmitted to the neonate causing local or systemic neonatal infections that can be difficult to treat with conventionally available antimicrobials. In order to develop effective treatment strategies, there is need for updated information about the prevalence of colonization with important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the prevalence of vaginal colonization with potentially pathogenic and clinically important AMR bacteria among women in labour in Uganda and to identify factors associated with colonization. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-1 and HIV-2 negative women in labour at three primary health care facilities in Uganda. Drug susceptibility testing was done using the disk diffusion method on bacterial isolates cultured from vaginal swabs. We calculated the prevalence of colonization with potentially pathogenic and clinically important AMR bacteria, in addition to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, defined as bacteria resistant to antibiotics from  3 antibiotic classes. RESULTS: We found that 57 of the 1472 enrolled women (3.9% prevalence; 95% Confidence interval [CI] 3.0%, 5.1%) were colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceace, 27 (1.8%; 95% CI 1.2%, 2.6%) were colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and 85 (5.8%; 95% CI 4.6%, 7.1%) were colonized with MRSA. The prevalence of colonization with MDR bacteria was high (750/1472; 50.9%; 95% CI 48.4%, 53.5%). Women who were  30 years of age had higher odds of being colonized with MDR bacteria compared to women aged 20C24 years (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1, 2.2). CONCLUSION: Most of the women included in our study were vaginally colonized with potentially pathogenic MDR and other clinically important AMR bacteria.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 positive in the emergency department from March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry <90% and a preprone position pulse oximetry &#8804;94% who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test. RESULTS: Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria.

To examine the effect of personality factors on people's self-disclosure on SNSs, we develop a model based on the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory. We suggest that people's narcissism traits and two types of time perspective (i.e. future and present-hedonistic) have positive effects on their self-disclosure.

Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning.

In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible.

However, the role of hsa_circ_0001666 in PTC progression remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the potential function and underlying mechanism of hsa_circ_0001666 in PTC. The results demonstrated that hsa_circ_0001666 was upregulated in both PTC clinical samples and cell lines. Its expression was associated with lymph node metastasis of patients with PTC.

Semi-automated image analysis was performed on all cases and 30 matched controls. The metabolic parameter mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean ) was calculated for the whole brain and three brain regions implicated in depression pathogenesis. A standardized SUVmean was also estimated by dividing regional brain SUVmean with whole-brain SUVmean . Cases had lower average whole-brain SUVmean (3.90  1.49 vs. 5.10  1.35, P = 0.001) and average regional brain SUVmean (4.57  2.31 vs. 9.96  3.58, P < 0.001) compared to controls. Whole-brain SUVmean had a significant correlation with patient age, NYHA class, diabetes, creatinine levels, depression, and cognitive impairment. Regional brain SUVmean was correlated with whole-brain SUVmean and depression. The standardized SUVmean , in particular, was found to be a robust index that could differentiate HF patients with 'epiphenomenal' (>0.93) or 'real' (0.93) depression. CONCLUSION Heart failure patients with more severe disease showed whole-brain and regional brain hypometabolism in 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Depressed HF patients (Beck Depression Inventory score >13) exhibited different metabolic patterns that could be used to differentiate between 'epiphenomenal' and 'real' depression. Namely, presence of whole-brain hypometabolism suggested 'epiphenomenal' depression, whereas absence suggested 'real' depression.

One viral strain presented a previously unreported mutation in the Nsp2 gene, namely K489E. Epidemiologically-defined clusters displayed specific mutations, suggesting molecular signatures for strains coming from areas that were isolated during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Romanian epidemic was initiated by multiple introductions from European countries followed by local transmissions. Different subtype distribution between northern and southern Romania was observed after two months of the pandemic.","output":"Molecular Epidemiology Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Strains Circulating in Romania during the First Months of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early months of the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe and Asia, but the same benefits have not been observed in some developing countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries, particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities. The economic infrastructure of these countries, often concentrated in a few cities, forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19 testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease transmission. By smart testing we mean the testing protocol that is automatically designed by our optimization platform for a given time period, knowing the available number of tests, the current availability of ICU beds and the initial epidemiological situation. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and city-specific social distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution, we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while reducing the need for social distancing measures, even when testing capacity is limited.","output":"Smart testing and critical care bed sharing for COVID-19 control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the etiologic agent associated with coronavirus disease, which emerged in late 2019.

However, empirically determined NIV settings may not achieve optimal ventilatory support. Therefore, the efficacy of NIV should be systematically monitored. The minimal recommended monitoring strategy includes clinical assessment, arterial blood gases (ABG) and nocturnal transcutaneous pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Polysomnography is a theoretical gold standard but is not routinely available in many centers. Simple tools such as transcutaneous capnography (TcPCO(2)) or ventilator built-in software provide reliable informations but their role in NIV monitoring has yet to be defined. The aim of our work was to compare the accuracy of different combinations of tests to assess NIV efficacy. METHODS: This retrospective comparative study evaluated the efficacy of NIV in consecutive patients through four strategies (A, B, C and D) using four different tools in various combinations. These tools included morning ABG, nocturnal SpO(2), TcPCO(2) and data provided by built-in software via a dedicated module. Strategy A (ABG + nocturnal SpO(2)), B (nocturnal SpO(2) + TcPCO(2)) and C (TcPCO(2) + builtin software) were compared to strategy D, which combined all four tools (NIV was appropriate if all four tools were normal). RESULTS: NIV was appropriate in only 29 of the 100 included patients. Strategy A considered 53 patients as appropriately ventilated. Strategy B considered 48 patients as appropriately ventilated. Strategy C misclassified only 6 patients with daytime hypercapnia. CONCLUSION: Monitoring ABG and nocturnal SpO(2) is not enough to assess NIV efficacy. Combining data from ventilator built-in software and TcPCO(2) seems to represent the best strategy to detect poor NIV efficacy.

The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea but diarrhea occurs in 40-70% of patients after hospital admission. Respiratory failure is the major complication of SARS; at least half of the patients require supplemental oxygen during the acute phase whereas about 20% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support. In contrast, the severity is generally mild in infected young children. Due to our limited understanding of this new disease, treatment of SARS was empirical in 2003. Protease inhibitor (Lopinavir/ritonavir) in combination with ribavirin may play a role as antiviral therapy in the early phase whereas nelfinavir is a promising alternative. The role of interferon and systemic steroid in preventing immune-mediated lung injury deserves further investigation.

However, few studies have reported the delivery of mRNA to the kidney. In this study, we attempted to deliver mRNA to the kidney based on the principle of pressure stimulation, by administering mRNA-loaded polyplex nanomicelles via a renal pelvis injection, directly into the kidney. Compared with the administration of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) and naked mRNA, the mRNA-loaded nanomicelles diffusely induced protein expression in a greater number of cells at the tubular epithelium for some days. The plasma creatinine (Cre) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels after the administration remained similar to those of the sham-operated controls, without marked changes in histological sections.

The use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant therapy with western drugs can lower the fatality rate due to the COVID-19. Therefore, in silico molecular docking study was performed to search potential phytochemicals and drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The protein-protein docking of the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 was carried out with the virus spike (S) protein to examine the conformational details and residues involved in the complex formation. Subsequently, a library of 163 ligands containing phytochemicals and drugs was virtually screened to propose potential hits that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The phytochemicals like limonin, gedunin, eribulin, pedunculagin, limonin glycoside and betunilic acid bind at the active site of both furin and TMPRSS2. Limonin and gedunin found mainly in the citrus fruits and neem showed the highest binding energy at the active site of furin and TMPRSS2, respectively.

Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT) is a glycosaminoglycan derivative of heparin with robust anti-inflammatory properties, with the potential to address underlying causes of coagulation disorders with substantially reduced risk of bleeding compared to commercially available heparin. METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of DSTAT added to standard of care in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose-escalating cohorts to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. DISCUSSION: Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone have likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery. Analysis of additional endpoints, including supportive biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, HMGB1, soluble-RAGE, D-dimer), will be performed to further define the effect of DSTAT in patients with COVID-19 infection.

The objective of this study is to describe the experience of US family planning providers with the rapid adoption of telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during this period. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional web-based survey of family planning providers practicing in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 172 providers completed the survey (34% response rate). Of these, 156 (91%) provided telemedicine services in the 2 months preceding the survey. Most (78%) were new to telemedicine. About half (54%) referred less than a quarter of contraception patients for in-person visits, and 53% stated that the most common referral reason was long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) insertion. A majority of providers strongly agree that telemedicine visits are an effective way to provide contraceptive counseling (80%), and that this service should be expanded after the pandemic (84%). If asked to provide telemedicine visits after the pandemic, 64% of providers would be very happy about it. Many providers used personal phones or smartphones to conduct telemedicine visits but stated that ideal devices would be work-issued computers, tablets, or phones. More than half (59%) of providers prefer video over phone visits. CONCLUSIONS: Family planning clinicians in the United States reported a positive experience with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and believe that this service should be expanded. Clinicians seem to prefer using work-issued devices and conducting video rather than phone visits.

Objective We aimed to gain insights into possible changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in the UK after temporarily increased intergenerational interactions in late December 2020. Method We modelled changes in time use and social mixing based on age-stratified contact rates using historical nationally-representative surveys and up-to-date Google mobility data from four weeks before and after the festive period. We explored changes in the effective reproduction number and the age distribution of cases, in four scenarios: (1) \\"normal\\": time use and contact patterns as observed historically, (2) \\"pre-lockdown\\": patterns as seen before the lockdown in November 2020, (3) \\"lockdown\\": patterns restricted as in November 2020, and (4) \\"festive break\\": similar to 3 but with social visits over the holiday period as in 1. Results Across ages, the estimated Reff decreases during the festive break in scenarios 1-3 and returns to pre-holiday levels in scenarios 2-3, while remaining relatively stable in scenario 4. Relative incidence is likely to decrease in children aged 0-15 but increase in other ages. Changes in age distribution were large during the holidays, and are likely to start before the holidays for individuals aged 16-24 years in scenarios 1-3. Conclusions Our modelling findings suggest that increased contacts during the festive period may shift the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from children towards adults. Given that COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths rise by age, more intergenerational mixing risks an increased burden in the period following the holidays.","output":"Time use and social mixing during and around festive periods: Potential changes in the age distribution of COVID-19 cases from increased intergenerational interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was conducted to explore the possible introduction and circulation of this novel virus in Catalonia, northeastern Spain.

Consequently, much research has gone into the development of preclinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (priming) that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan. Also, we profiled a camostat metabolite, FOY-251, and bromhexine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved mucolytic cough suppressant. The rank order potency for the compounds tested are nafamostat (IC(50) = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC(50) = 6.2 nM), FOY-251 (IC(50) = 33.3 nM), and gabexate (IC(50) = 130 nM). Bromhexine hydrochloride showed no inhibition of TMPRSS2. Further profiling of camostat, nafamostat, and gabexate against a panel of recombinant proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","output":"An Enzymatic TMPRSS2 Assay for Assessment of Clinical Candidates and Discovery of Inhibitors as Potential Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have experienced anxiety and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. We established and report findings from an occupational health programme for HCWs in Zimbabwe that offered screening for SARS-CoV-2 with integrated screening for comorbidities including common mental disorder (CMD) and referral for counselling. METHODS: Quantitative outcomes were fearfulness about COVID-19, the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14) score (cutpoint 8/14) and the number and proportion of HCWs offered referral for counselling, accepting referral and counselled. We used chi square tests to identify factors associated with fearfulness, and logistic regression was used to model the association of fearfulness with wave, adjusting for variables identified using a DAG. Qualitative data included 18 in-depth interviews, two workshops conducted with HCWs and written feedback from counsellors, analysed concurrently with data collection using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Between 27 July 2020C31 July 2021, spanning three SARS-CoV-2 waves, the occupational health programme was accessed by 3577 HCWs from 22 facilities. The median age was 37 (IQR 30C43) years, 81.9% were women, 41.7% said they felt fearful about COVID-19 and 12.1% had an SSQ-14 score  8. A total of 501 HCWs were offered referral for counselling, 78.4% accepted and 68.9% had 1 counselling session. Adjusting for setting and role, wave 2 was associated with increased fearfulness over wave 1 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.00C1.60). Qualitative data showed high levels of anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms and burnout related to the pandemic. Mental wellbeing was affected by financial insecurity, unmet physical health needs and inability to provide quality care within a fragile health system. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in Zimbabwe experience a high burden of mental health symptoms, intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainable mental health interventions must be multisectoral addressing mental, physical and financial wellbeing.","output":"Psychological distress among healthcare workers accessing occupational health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has drawn public attention all over the world As a newly emerging area, single cell sequencing also exerts its power in the battle over the epidemic In this review, the up-to-date knowledge of COVID-19 and its receptor is summarized, followed by a collection of the mining of single cell transcriptome profiling data for the information in aspects of the vulnerable cell types in humans and the potential mechanisms of the disease ? 2021 All Rights Reserved","output":"COVID-19 Related Research by Data Mining in Single Cell Transcriptome Profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article is to analyse the qualitative and quantitative research conducted between 2018 and 2020 in the field of tourist traffic in the Tatra National Park.

As a follow\\\\up to an in vitro study on the effect of oral antiseptics on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1, this study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo effect of an essential oil containing oral antiseptic on the reduction of viral titer in saliva during active viral infection. Method: Patients were recruited and evaluated in a single visit protocol at the onset of a perioral outbreak, consistent historically and clinically with recurrent Herpes labialis. Direct immunofluorescence of cytological smears of the lesions/oral fluids was used to confirm Herpes simplex virus types I or II. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) active ingredient and (2) sterile water control. The viral lesion was evaluated as to clinical stage according to standard protocol. Salivary fluid samples were taken: (1) at baseline; (2) immediately following a 30 s rinse; (3) 30 min. after the 30 s rinse; and (4) on the repeat trial, also at 60 min. after the 30 s rinse. All samples were evaluated for viral titer and results compared. Results: In Trial 1, the sample population consisted of 19 males and 21 females with an average age of 29.2 and in Trial 2, 21 males, 19 females with an average age of 28. In both Trials 1 and 2, recoverable infectious virions were reduced to zero after a 30 s experimental rinse; whereas, the control rinse resulted in a non\\\\significant (p>0.05) reduction.

Electronic databases (Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE) were screened for studies. No language restrictions were applied. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate. Primary outcome included assessment of WSL with visual-tactile assessment and/or laser fluorescence measurements. Twenty-four studies with 1117 patients (age: 11-40 years) and 12,809 teeth were included. Overall, 34 different sealants or bonding materials were analysed. Fourteen studies analysed fluoride and 14 studies non-fluoride releasing materials. Meta-analysis for visual tactile assessment revealed that sealants significantly decreased the initiation of WSL compared to untreated control (RR [95%CI] = 0.70 [0.53; 0.93]; very low level of evidence). Materials releasing fluoride did not decrease initiation of WSL compared to those with no fluoride release (RR [95%CI] = 0.84 [0.70; 1.01]; very low level of evidence). For laser fluorescence measurements no meta-analysis could be performed. The use of sealants seems to be effective in preventing the initiation of post-orthodontic WSL. Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting that fluoride-releasing sealants or bonding materials are more effective than those without fluoride release. No gold standard prevention strategy to prevent WSL during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances has been established yet.

Methods This project was a survey of county health departments in the state of Kansas with data collection period from April 15 to April 24, 2020. This study evaluated the staffing, resources, and funding of these health departments and how it was affecting the efforts to contain COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. Results A total of 75% of the county health departments in Kansas responded to the survey. In 89% of locations, the staffing had not increased. Most health departments had an average of five people and the four largest ones had 30 to 98 staff working on COVID-19. Most locations used the Kansas Department of Health and Environment criteria for testing and used a combination of state or private laboratories. The results of the tests were available three days or longer in 62% and after five days in 14% of sites. All locations were active in contact tracing, but most had one to three people for this purpose and in 90% the contact tracing interview was via phone calls. There was no change in funding in 21% and decreased funding in 8.5% of health departments. Most locations had an average of five nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of the survey. The most common needs expressed were help to increase testing capability, more public education, more personal protective equipment, increased personnel, and assistance with contract tracing.

Different cut angles and cut depths of barbs were prepared and tested in vitro for their tensile and tissue anchoring properties by means of a novel suture/tissue pullout test. Experiments were also performed using bovine tendon and porcine skin tissues. The experimental results revealed that since tendon tissue has a higher modulus than skin it needs a more rigid barb to penetrate and anchor the surrounding tissue. A cut angle of 150 degrees and a cut depth of 0.18 mm are therefore recommended. On the other hand, for the softer skin tissue, a cut angle of 170 degrees and a cut depth of 0.18 mm provides a more flexible barb that gives superior skin tissue anchoring. These findings confirm that the future development of barbed suture technology requires a detailed understanding of the biomechanical properties of the tissue in which they are to be used.

We show here that viruses differing only in the envelope glycoprotein (Env) expressed on their surface have different sensitivities to IFITM3. Measurements of the sensitivity of viruses to neutralizing antibodies showed that IFITM3 increased the sensitivity of IFITM3-sensitive viruses to PG16, which targets the V1V2 loop, suggesting that IFITM3 promotes exposure of the PG16 epitope of IFITM3-sensitive viruses. Exchanges of V1V2 loops between the Env proteins of sensitive and resistant viruses revealed that V1V2 and V3 act together to modulate viral sensitivity to IFITM3. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IFITM3 interacted with both the precursor (gp160) and cleaved (gp120) forms of Env from IFITM3-sensitive viruses, but only with the precursor (gp160) form of Env from IFITM3-resistant viruses. This finding suggests that the interaction between the Env of resistant viruses and IFITM3 was inhibited once Env had been processed in the Golgi apparatus. This hypothesis was supported by immunofluorescence experiments, which showed a strong colocalization of IFITM3 with the Env of sensitive viruses, but only weak colocalization with the Env of resistant viruses on the plasma membrane of virus-producing cells. Together, these results indicate that IFITM3 interacts with Env, inducing conformational changes that may decrease viral infectivity. This antiviral action is, nevertheless, modulated by the nature of the Env, in particular its V1V2 and V3 loops, which after maturation may be able to escape this interaction.IMPORTANCE Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a cellular factor that reduces HIV-1 infectivity by an incompletely understood mechanism. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) in determining viral susceptibility to IFITM3. We found that viruses differing only in Env expressed on their surface had different sensitivities to IFITM3. By comparing the Env proteins of viruses that were highly sensitive or resistant to IFITM3, we obtained new insight in the mechanisms by which HIV-1 escapes this protein. We showed that IFITM3 interacts with the Env protein of sensitive viruses in virion-producing cells, inducing conformational changes that may decrease viral infectivity.

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. METHODS: Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities and age profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-y (2020) interruption or a 2-y (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. RESULTS: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19's impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the validity of resilience (10 items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10)) and grit (Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S)) scores among IM residents at a large academic centre, and assess potential associations with previously validated measures of medical knowledge, clinical performance and professionalism. METHODS: We evaluated CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S instrument scores among IM residents at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota between July 2017 and June 2019. We analysed dimensionality, internal consistency reliability and criterion validity in terms of relationships between resilience and grit, with standardised measures of residents medical knowledge (in-training examination (ITE)), clinical performance (faculty and peer evaluations and Mini-Clinical Evaluation Examination (mini-CEX)) and professionalism/dutifulness (conference attendance and evaluation completion). RESULTS: A total of 213 out of 253 (84.2%) survey-eligible IM residents provided both CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S survey responses. Internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha) was excellent for CD-RISC 10 (0.93) and GRIT-S (0.82) overall, and for the GRIT subscales of consistency of interest (0.84) and perseverance of effort (0.71). CD-RISC 10 scores were negatively associated with ITE percentile (=?3.4, 95% CI ?6.2 to ?0.5, p=0.02) and mini-CEX (=?0.2, 95% CI ?0.5 to ?0.02, p=0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed favourable validity evidence for CD-RISC 10 and GRIT-S among IM residents. Residents demonstrated resilience within a competitive training environment despite less favourable test performance and grittiness that was manifested by completing tasks.

Here, we established novel in silico approaches and applied them to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) as a case study. First, we identified six potential allosteric modulators. Then, we focused on understanding the allosteric effects of these modulators on each of its protomers. We introduced a new combinatorial approach and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis algorithms to examine patterns of change and conservation of critical nodes, according to five independent criteria of network centrality. We observed highly conserved network hubs for each averaged DRN metric on the basis of their existence in both protomers in the absence and presence of all ligands (persistent hubs). We also detected ligand specific signal changes. Using eigencentrality (EC) persistent hubs and ligand introduced hubs we identified a residue communication path connecting the allosteric binding site to the catalytic site. Finally, we examined the effects of the mutations on the behavior of the protein in the presence of selected potential allosteric modulators and investigated the ligand stability. One crucial outcome was to show that EC centrality hubs form an allosteric communication path between the allosteric ligand binding site to the active site going through the interface residues of domains I and II; and this path was either weakened or lost in the presence of some of the mutations. Overall, the results revealed crucial aspects that need to be considered in rational computational drug discovery.","output":"Novel dynamic residue network analysis approaches to study allosteric modulation: SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and its evolutionary mutations as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a retrospective study of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral load kinetics using data from patients hospitalised with MERS-CoV infection between 19 May and 20 August, 2015.

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.","output":"Management of thyroid disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak: a position statement from the Thyroid Department of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (SBEM)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether COVID-19 is associated with a different presenting clinical picture or a more severe course of illness in people with a past history of chemical war injury.

Following the development of RT-qPCR methods to meet this diagnostic need in January 2020, it became clear from interlaboratory studies that the reported Ct values obtained for the different laboratories showed high variability. Despite this the Ct values were explored as a quantitative cut off to aid clinical decisions based on viral load. Consequently, there was a need to introduce standards to support estimation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in diagnostic specimens. In a collaborative study, INSTAND established two reference materials (RMs) containing heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads of ~10(7) copies/mL (RM 1) and ~10(6) copies/mL (RM 2), respectively. Quantification was performed by RT-qPCR using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards and digital PCR. Between November 2020 and February 2021, German laboratories were invited to use the two RMs to anchor their Ct values measured in routine diagnostic specimens, with the Ct values of the two RMs. A total of 305 laboratories in Germany were supplied with RM 1 and RM 2. The laboratories were requested to report their measured Ct values together with details on the PCR method they used to INSTAND. This resultant 1,109 data sets were differentiated by test system and targeted gene region. Our findings demonstrate that an indispensable prerequisite for linking Ct values to SARS-CoV-2 viral loads is that they are treated as being unique to an individual laboratory. For this reason, clinical guidance based on viral loads should not cite Ct values. The RMs described were a suitable tool to determine the specific laboratory Ct for a given viral load. Furthermore, as Ct values can also vary between runs when using the same instrument, such RMs could be used as run controls to ensure reproducibility of the quantitative measurements.","output":"RNA reference materials with defined viral RNA loads of SARS-CoV-2A useful tool towards a better PCR assay harmonization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education s vital to every Filipino especially the delivery of quality education without compromising the health and safety of the students amidst COVID-19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS One in five adolescents is diagnosed with prediabetes. Recent studies have elucidated the impact of early exposures such as maternal diabetes, but also hyperglycemia below the threshold of gestational diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and paternal obesity on the future metabolic health of the offspring. Mechanisms affecting the developmental programing of offspring toward type 2 diabetes include epigenetic modifications, alterations in stem cell differentiation, metabolome and microbiome variation, immune dysregulation, and neonatal nutrition. The risk of type 2 diabetes in offspring is increased not only by diabetes exposure in utero but also by exposure to a heterogeneous milieu of factors that accompany maternal obesity that provoke a vicious cycle of metabolic disease. The key period for intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes is within the first 1000 days of life.","output":"Type 2 Diabetes in Youth: the Role of Early Life Exposures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic has adversely affected tourism globally, particularly in small island states heavily dependent on tourism. The closure of borders to regular flights for over a year in places such as Fiji, Samoa, Cook Islands and Vanuatu, where this research was undertaken, has resulted in massive job losses. Many tourism employees have left the once\\\\bustling tourist hubs, returning to villages and family settlements. Such clear urban to rural migration behaviours do not dominate movement patterns in the Pacific, but are an important and enduring strategy when shocks strike. In the case of the pandemic\\\\induced migration to villages, former tourism workers have had to engage in a complicated process of adapting to the communal setting, employing new C as well as traditional C strategies to sustain a livelihood. Thus, this paper will discuss how the pandemic has influenced return migration patterns in the Pacific, and the implications of this shift. Findings suggest that, despite their financial struggles, people have adapted to life in their ancestral homes by rekindling their relationships with kin and increasing their engagement on their customary land. They have relearned about traditional Indigenous knowledge, diversified their skills and reconnected with their social and ecological systems. This spiritual homecoming observed in the Pacific ultimately shows that there can be silver linings to the dark clouds of the current disorder.","output":"Silver linings around dark clouds: Tourism, Covid\\\\19 and a return to traditional values, villages and the vanua"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the COVID-19 global pandemic, discover how a consumer health librarian transitioned in-person programs, resources, services, and health education sessions into a completely virtual consumer health library reaching over 200% more people than the year before. ? 2021 The Author(s).

Safety, ethical and financial factors make training in the area challenging. Head model 3-dimensional (3D) printing is a realistic training alternative to patient and traditional means of cadaver and animal model simulation. OBJECTIVE To describe important factors relating to the 3D printing of human head models and how such models perform as simulators. METHODS Searches were performed in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science. Article screening was conducted independently by three reviewers using Covidence software. Data items were collected under five categories: 'Study information', 'Printers and processes' 'Head model specifics,' 'Simulation and evaluations' and 'Costs and production times'. RESULTS Forty articles published over the last 10 years were included in the review. A range of printers, printing methods and substrates were used to create head models and tissue types. Complexity of the models ranged from sections of single tissue type (e.g., bone) to high-fidelity integration of multiple tissue types. Some models incorporated pathology (e.g., tumours, aneurysms) and artificial physiology (e.g., pulsatile circulation). Aneurysm clipping, bone drilling, craniotomy, endonasal surgery and tumour resection were the most commonly practiced procedures. Evaluations completed by those using the models were generally favourable. CONCLUSIONS This review's findings indicate that those who practice surgery and surgical techniques on 3D printed head models deem them to be valuable assets in cranial surgery training. Understanding how surgical simulation on such models impacts on surgical performance and patient outcomes, whilst considering cost-effectiveness, are important future research endeavours.","output":"Properties and characteristics of 3-dimensional printed head models used in simulation of neurosurgical procedures: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the direct relationship between business ownership and economic vibrancy within communities of color, this research explores a tailored approach for addressing persistent race-based economic disparities inhibiting business ownership in communities of color.

In addition, bats have a low incidence of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we discovered that bat cells are more resistant than human and mouse cells to DNA damage induced by genotoxic drugs. We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence.","output":"ABCB1 protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has proven to be an important tool for the management of autonomous nerve system in both surgical and critically ill patients. We conducted this study to show the different spectral frequency and time domain parameters of HRV as a prospective predictor for critically ill patients, and in particular for COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that most severely ill COVID-19 patients have a depletion of the sympathetic nervous system and a predominance of parasympathetic activity reflecting the remaining compensatory anti-inflammatory response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, prospective, observational pilot study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was conducted. The normalized high-frequency component (HFnu), i.e. ANIm, and the standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), i.e. Energy, were recorded using the analgesia nociception index monitor (ANI). To estimate the severity and mortality we used the SOFA score and the date of discharge or date of death. RESULTS: A total of fourteen patients were finally included in the study. ANIm were higher in the non-survivor group (p = 0.003) and were correlated with higher IL-6 levels (p = 0.020). Energy was inversely correlated with SOFA (p = 0.039) and fewer survival days (p = 0.046). A limit value at 80 of ANIm, predicted mortalities with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85.7%. In the case of Energy, a limit value of 0.41 ms predicted mortality with all predictive values of 71.4%. CONCLUSION: A low autonomic nervous system activity, i.e. low SDNN or Energy, and a predominance of the parasympathetic system, i.e. low HFnu or ANIm, due to the sympathetic depletion in COVID-19 patients are associated with a worse prognosis, higher mortality, and higher IL-6 levels.","output":"Is the heart rate variability monitoring using the analgesia nociception index a predictor of illness severity and mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19?

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 59,930 nursing home staff tested for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indiana. MEASURES: Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000. RESULTS: The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval 0.601a??0.696) and 0.649 (95% confidence interval 0.601a??0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants, yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive. Similarly, licensed practical nurses were 1.4% of staff, but 4.7% of positive cases. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We failed to observe a meaningful threshold of community COVID-19 activity for the purpose of predicting nursing homes with any positive staff. Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in August 2020 sets the minimum frequency of routine testing for nursing home staff based on county positivity rates. Using the recommended 5% county positivity rate to require weekly testing may miss asymptomatic infections among nursing home staff. Further data on results of all-staff testing efforts, particularly with the implementation of new widespread strategies such as point-of-care testing, is needed to guide policy to protect high-risk nursing home residents and staff.

The body of evidence on COVID-19 increases at an impressive pace, calling for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unsuitable due to their narrow scope and high time-consumption. OBJECTIVE: To explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the titles, keywords, and abstracts of articles on COVID-19 from PubMed. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted trend analysis to explore the temporal changes of research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographical origin. RESULTS: Our search identified 16 670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these articles, six were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on COVID-19 patients. We identified 14 main research topics. The most common topics were healthcare response, and clinical manifestations with 2 812/16 670 (16.9%) and 1 828/16 670 (11.0%) publications, respectively. We found a growing trend of publications on clinical manifestations, and protective measures, and a decrease in research on disease transmission, epidemiology, healthcare response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. We calculated an overall median JIF of 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9) and found that the publications' JIF declined over time. The top countries of research origin were the USA, China, Italy, and the UK. CONCLUSIONS: In less than six months since the detection of the novel coronavirus, a remarkably high number of articles on COVID-19 have been published.

Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed but appear insufficient to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 unless two or three of them are being combined. Therefore, heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin, that have been used for decades to fight against infectious agents might represent a highly efficient alternative to the use of CP or mAbs in COVID-19 by targeting multiple antigen epitopes. However, conventional heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal 1,3-galactose (Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and 1,3-galactosyl-transferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and -Gal epitopes. We found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses, a drawback possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 or to avoiding a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Therefore, we immunized CMAH/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Animals rapidly developed a hyperimmune response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 end-titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end-titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10,000.

In addition to ensuring patients are SARS-CoV-2 negative at the time of surgery it is important that the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is minimized through their recovery.

This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (740%) had emergency surgery and 280 (248%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (261%) patients. 30-day mortality was 238% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (512%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 380% (219 of 577), accounting for 826% (219 of 265) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 175 [95% CI 128C240], p<00001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (230 [165C322], p<00001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3C5 versus grades 1C2 (235 [157C353], p<00001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (155 [101C239], p=0046), emergency versus elective surgery (167 [106C263], p=0026), and major versus minor surgery (152 [101C231], p=0047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

The story began with Hippocrates 400 B.C. with his description of mumps and diphtheria. No further discoveries were recorded until 1100 A.D. when the smallpox vaccine was described. During the eighteenth century, vaccines for cholera and yellow fever were reported and Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination and immunology, published his work on smallpox. The nineteenth century was a major landmark, with the Germ Theory of disease of Louis Pasteur, the discovery of the germ tubercle bacillus for tuberculosis by Robert Koch, and the isolation of pneumococcus organism by George Miller Sternberg. Another landmark was the discovery of diphtheria toxin by Emile Roux and its serological treatment by Emil Von Behring and Paul Ehrlih. In addition, Pasteur was able to generate the first live-attenuated viral vaccine against rabies. Typhoid vaccines were then developed, followed by the plague vaccine of Yersin. At the beginning of World War I, the tetanus toxoid was introduced, followed in 1915 by the pertussis vaccine. In 1974, The Expanded Program of Immunization was established within the WHO for bacille CalmetteCGuerin, Polio, DTP, measles, yellow fever, and hepatitis B. The year 1996 witnessed the launching of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In 1988, the WHO passed a resolution to eradicate polio by the year 2000 and in 2006; the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was developed. In 2010, The Decade of vaccines was launched, and on April 1st 2012, the United Nations launched the shot@Life campaign. In brief, the armamentarium of vaccines continues to grow with more emphasis on safety, availability, and accessibility. This mini review highlights the major historical events and pioneers in the course of development of vaccines, which have eradicated so many life-threatening diseases, despite the vaccination attitudes and waves appearing through history.","output":"Vaccines Through Centuries: Major Cornerstones of Global Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The original article can be found online.","output":"Correction to: Computed tomography surveillance helps tracking COVID?19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a serious public health concern worldwide. Although, most of the regions around the globe have been affected by COVID-19 infections; some regions are more badly affected in terms of infections and fatality rates than others. The exact reasons for such variations are not clear yet. This review discussed the possible effects of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and mortality based on some recent evidence. The findings of most studies reviewed here demonstrate that both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution especially PM(2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) may contribute significantly to higher rates of COVID-19 infections and mortalities with a lesser extent also PM(10). A significant correlation has been found between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality in some countries in the world. The available data also indicate that exposure to air pollution may influence COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, exposure to air pollution may increase vulnerability and have harmful effects on the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19 infections. Further research should be conducted considering some potential confounders such as age and pre-existing medical conditions along with exposure to NO(2), PM(2.5) and other air pollutants to confirm their detrimental effects on mortalities from COVID-19.","output":"The Effects of Air Pollution on COVID-19 Infection and MortalityA Review on Recent Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the physical activity (PA) of UK adults and potential motivational determinants of such behaviour. Design and methods A survey was conducted with 1,521 UK adults recruited through Prolific.co in early June 2020. Along with demographic information, questions assessed current PA, changes in PA modalities (i.e., overall, around the home, for transport, in the workplace, in the local neighbourhood, at recreation/sport facilities) related to the lockdown, and beliefs about capabilities, opportunities, and motivations according to the COM-B model. A series of logistic regressions were constructed to examine associations between shifts in the PA modalities and the COM-B components. Results The majority of respondents (57%) had either maintained or increased their levels of PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the proportion meeting PA guidelines (31%) was low and engagement in sedentary-related behaviour for both work and leisure increased substantially during the lockdown. The components of the COM-B model were associated with shifts in PA. In particular, physical opportunity (odds ratios ranging from 1.14 to 1.20) and reflective motivation (odds ratios ranging from 1.11 to 1.25) appeared to be the most consistent predictors of behaviour. Conclusions If UK adults believed they had the physical opportunity and were motivated, they were more likely to have maintained or increased their PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the majority of adults are not meeting the UK guidelines on PA and the prevalence of PA is substantially lower than national surveys prior to the pandemic. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the daily routines of citizens globally. Engagement in physical activity appears to have declined as a result of the requirement to self-isolate and stay in place. The COM-B model of behaviour change is a useful framework for identifying the correlates and determinants of behaviour. What does this study add? Though most UK adults maintained or increased their engagement in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority did not meet recommended guidelines. Reflective processes and physical opportunity were the primary predictors of change in physical activity.","output":"Determinants of physical activity among adults in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: The DUK-COVID study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel viral infection that primarily affects the lungs and runs the gamut from a mild, self-limiting, febrile illness to respiratory failure and death. It manifested as a global pandemic in 2020 and has since claimed millions of lives. Only a few months into this pandemic, it became evident that the viral infection leads to a hypercoagulable state. Anticoagulants became a standard and important part of therapy while d-dimer became a useful test to guide the choice of the anticoagulant (therapeutic vs prophylactic Lovenox). What remains unclear is how viral pneumonia can cause hypercoagulability, especially when it leads to thrombosis in unusual sites such as the portal vein. Another important question that remains unanswered is the duration of anticoagulation after discharge in the outpatient setting.

Using dissimilar search strategies for new antivirals will improve our overall chances of finding effective treatments. Here, we have established an experimental platform for screening of small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, genetically engineered to enhance cellular uptake of small molecules in the environment. The system consists of a fusion of the E. coli toxin MazF and its antitoxin MazE, with insertion of a protease cleavage site in the linker peptide connecting the MazE and MazF moieties. Expression of the viral protease confers cleavage of the MazEF fusion, releasing the MazF toxin from its antitoxin, resulting in growth inhibition. In the presence of a small molecule inhibiting the protease, cleavage is blocked and the MazF toxin remains inhibited, promoting growth. The system thus allows positive selection for inhibitors. The engineered yeast strain is tagged with a fluorescent marker protein, allowing precise monitoring of its growth in the presence or absence of inhibitor. We detect an established main protease inhibitor down to 10 M by a robust growth increase. The system is suitable for robotized large-scale screens. It allows in vivo evaluation of drug candidates, and is rapidly adaptable for new variants of the protease with deviant site specificities. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic may continue several years before vaccination campaigns can put an end it globally. Thus, the need for discovery of new antiviral drug candidates will remain. We have engineered a system in yeast cells for detection of small molecule inhibitors of one attractive drug target of SARS-CoV-2, its main protease which is required for viral replication. To detect inhibitors in live cells brings the advantage that only compounds capable of entering the cell and remain stable there, will score in the system. Moreover, by its design in yeast, the system is rapidly adaptable for tuning of detection level, eventual modification of protease cleavage site in case of future mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or even for other proteases.","output":"A genetic trap in yeast for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The various cutaneous manifestations have lately appeared in the setting of COVID\\\\19.

In this sc.enario, the OVs act as in situ cancer vaccines, since the immunogenicity of the virus is combined with tumor antigens, that direct the specificity of the anti-tumor adaptive immune response. However, this mechanism in some cases fails in eliciting a strong specific T cell response. One way to overcome this problem and enhance the priming efficiency is the production of genetically modified oncolytic viruses encoding one or more tumor antigens. To avoid the long and expensive process related to the engineering of the OVs, we have exploited an approach based on coating OVs (adenovirus and vaccinia virus) with tumor antigens. In this work, oncolytic viruses encoding tumor antigens and tumor antigen decorated adenoviral platform (PeptiCRAd) have been used as cancer vaccines and evaluated both for their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. We have first tested the oncolytic vaccines by exploiting the OVA model, moving then to TRP2, a more clinically relevant tumor antigen. Finally, both approaches have been investigated in tumor neo-antigens settings. Interestingly, both genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus and PeptiCRAd elicited T cells-specific anti-tumor responses. However, in vitro cross-representation experiments, showed an advantage of PeptiCRAd as regards the fast presentation of the model epitope SIINFEKL from OVA in an immunogenic rather than tolerogenic fashion. Here two approaches used as cancer oncolytic vaccines have been explored and characterized for their efficacy. Although the generation of specific anti-tumor T cells was elicited in both approaches, PeptiCRAd retains the advantage of being rapidly adaptable by coating the adenovirus with a different set of tumor antigens, which is crucial in personalized cancer vaccines clinical setting.","output":"Peptides-Coated Oncolytic Vaccines for Cancer Personalized Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the present stage, there is no information about the use of altitude chamber adaptation, as well as in combination with cytoflavin, in patients after pneumonia COVID-19 at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation Objective The aim of the research is to study the effect of altitude chamber adaptation one-and two-component courses at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation of patients suffering after pneumonia COVID-19 Material and methods The study included 255 people suffering after COVID-19 Group from 155 patients, whose average age was 53 0 [45 0;60 0] years, passed through single-component course of rehabilitation by altitude chamber adaptation Second group from 100 patientsle, the average age was 54 0 [45 0;59 5] years, passed a two-component course, including hypobaric adaptation and cytoflavin intake at the outpatient and home stages of medical rehabilitation Functional tests, scales characterizing the quality of life and the psychological state of patients before the rehabilitation course, 10 days and 3 months after the end of the course were analyzed Results The using of one- and two-component courses contributed to an increase in the performance of the Stange sample and dynamometry After the rehabilitation course, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Schulte Scale, Traumatic Event Impact Assessment Scale, EQ-5D Quality of Life Scale improved The results obtained were statistically significantly different after the rehabilitation course from the initial values and retained their difference after three months of observations The effectiveness of the twocomponent course was statistically significantly higher compared to the one-component course of altitude chamber adaptation Conclusions Stable prolonged effectiveness of one- and two-component course of altitude chamber adaptation in patients after COVID-19 on outpatient and home stage of medical rehabilitation was shown The addition of cytoflavin contributed to the enhancement of the rehabilitation effect of hypobaric adaptation The obtained data should be taken into account when developing comprehensive medical rehabilitation programs at the outpatient and home stages of rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19 (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]  ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ ѧ ӧ֧ ڧߧާѧڧ  ڧާ֧ߧ֧ߧڧ ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧܧѧާ֧ߧ ѧէѧѧڧ ܧѧ  ӧڧէ է֧ݧߧԧ ܧާߧ֧ߧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ, ѧ     ܧ ڧݧѧӧڧߧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ ݧ COVID-19 ߧ ѧާҧݧѧߧ  էާѧߧ֧ ѧѧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ֧ݧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ٧ڧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ էߧ էӧܧާߧ֧ߧߧԧ ܧ ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧܧѧާ֧ߧ ѧէѧѧڧ ߧ ѧާҧݧѧߧ  էާѧߧ֧ ѧѧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ݧ ֧֧ߧ֧֧ߧߧ ߧ֧ӧާߧڧ COVID-19 ѧ֧ڧѧݧ  ާ֧է  ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ӧܧݧ֧ߧ 255 ѧڧ֧ߧ ݧ ֧֧ߧ֧֧ߧߧ ߧ֧ӧާߧڧ COVID-19 էߧܧާߧ֧ߧߧ ܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ާ֧է ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧܧѧާ֧ߧ ѧէѧѧڧ ݧ 155 ѧڧ֧ߧ, ֧էߧڧ ӧ٧ѧ 53,0 [45,0;60,0] ԧէ  ѧާҧݧѧߧ  էާѧߧ֧ ѧѧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ էӧܧާߧ֧ߧߧ ܧ, ӧܧݧѧӧڧ ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ѧէѧѧڧ  ڧ֧ ڧݧѧӧڧߧ, ݧ 100 ѧڧ֧ߧ, ֧էߧڧ ӧ٧ѧ 54,0 [45,0;59,5] ԧէ ݧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧߧ ֧٧ݧѧ ߧܧڧߧѧݧߧ , ֧ߧܧ  ܧѧݧѧ, ѧѧܧ֧ڧ٧ڧ ܧѧ֧ӧ اڧ٧ߧ  ڧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ է ܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ, ֧֧ 10   3 ާ֧ ݧ ܧߧѧߧڧ ܧ ֧٧ݧѧ ڧާ֧ߧ֧ߧڧ էߧ էӧܧާߧ֧ߧߧԧ ܧ ҧӧӧѧݧ ӧ֧ߧڧ ܧѧ٧ѧ֧ݧ֧ ҧ ѧߧԧ  էڧߧѧާާ֧ڧ ݧ ܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ݧڧݧڧ ܧѧ٧ѧ֧ݧ ڧѧݧߧ ܧѧݧ ֧ӧԧ  է֧֧ڧ, ܧѧݧ ݧ, ܧѧݧ ֧ߧܧ ӧݧڧߧڧ ѧӧާѧڧ֧ܧԧ ҧڧ, ܧѧݧ ܧѧ֧ӧ اڧ٧ߧ EQ-5D ݧ֧ߧߧ ֧٧ݧѧ ѧڧڧ֧ܧ ٧ߧѧڧާ ݧڧѧݧڧ ݧ ܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ  ڧէߧ ٧ߧѧ֧ߧڧ  ѧߧڧݧ ӧ ݧڧڧ ֧֧ 3 ާ֧ ߧѧҧݧէ֧ߧڧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ էӧܧާߧ֧ߧߧԧ ܧ ҧݧ ѧڧڧ֧ܧ ٧ߧѧڧާ ӧ  ѧӧߧ֧ߧڧ  էߧܧާߧ֧ߧߧ ܧ ӧէ ܧѧ٧ѧߧ ۧڧӧѧ ݧߧԧڧӧѧߧߧѧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ էߧ էӧܧާߧ֧ߧߧԧ ܧ ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧܧѧާ֧ߧ ѧէѧѧڧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ ݧ COVID-19 ߧ ѧާҧݧѧߧ  էާѧߧ֧ ѧѧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ҧѧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ڧݧѧӧڧߧ ҧӧӧѧݧ ڧݧ֧ߧڧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧߧߧԧ ֧ܧ ԧڧҧѧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧܧѧާ֧ߧ ѧէѧѧڧ ݧ֧ߧߧ էѧߧߧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ ڧӧѧ  ѧ٧ѧҧܧ ܧާݧ֧ܧߧ ԧѧާ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ߧ ѧާҧݧѧߧ  էާѧߧ֧ ѧѧ ֧ѧҧڧݧڧѧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ݧ COVID-19 (Russian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Profilakticheskaya Meditsina is the property of Media Sphere Publishing House and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Application of altitude chamber adaptation as a component of the medical rehabilitation patients after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telehealth modalities were introduced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to assure continuation of cancer care and maintain social distance. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of our telehealth expansion programme. We adapted two existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) telemonitoring tools that register and (self-)manage toxicities to therapy, while screening for SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. Outpatients from a tertiary cancer centre were enrolled. The adapted PRO interface allowed for uniform registration of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and effective triage of patients at home where we also implemented systematic throat washings, when available. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty patients registered to the telemonitoring systems from March 13 to May 15, 2020. Four prespecified SARS-CoV-2 alarms resulted in three patients with positive PCR testing. Other Covid-19 symptoms (fever 5 and cough 2) led to pretreatment triage resulting in 1 seroconversion after initial negative testing. One of the 477 throat washings proved positive. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid adoption of an amended PRO (self-)registrations and toxicity management system was feasible and coordinated screening for Covid-19. Continued clinical cancer care was maintained, with significant decreased waiting time. The systemic screening with throat washings offered no real improvement.","output":"The tele-transition of toxicity management in routine oncology care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus has mutated very little, but as more people are treated or vaccinated it could face pressure to evolve, finds Graham Lawton","output":"The evolving coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of Covid-19, both people's health and the world economy are facing great challenges.

Comparing to the previous schemes, MLCT fully considers the different demands of the government, patients, and close contacts for user privacy and tracing efficiency in the different stages of Covid-19.

RECENT FINDINGS: The outbreak of the COVID-19 has had effect of unprecedented magnitude on the social, economic and personal aspects around the globe. Healthcare providers were forced to expand capacity to provide care to the surging number of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, while maintaining a fully operating service for all non-COVID patients. The recent literature suggesting an overall decrease in acute ischemic stroke admissions as well as total number of endovascular treatments will be reviewed. Although the underlying reasons therefore remain the matter of debate, it seems that the imposed restrictions, requiring social distancing, and stopping all nonessential services, have led to a higher threshold for patients to seek medical attention, in particular in those with less severe symptoms. Thus, raising public awareness on the importance of strokes and transient ischemic attacks is even more important in the light of the current situation to avoid serious healthcare, economic consequences, and limit long term morbidity.

Host defense mechanisms include proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-, and complement system proteins, all of which can induce coagulopathy. Tissue factor (TF) expression on monocytes/macrophages, neutrophil and platelet activation, produce activation of thrombosis. This thromboinflammatory response, together with extracellular vesicles, causes endothelial damage that further increase thrombin generation. A key role in the development of thrombosis has TF. Penetration of the infection into the body leads to the formation of the TF-f.VIIa complex on cell surfaces and in the bloodstream, which launches the initial phase of coagulation by activating factors IX and X. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides stimulate the synthesis and expression of TF on endothelial cells and monocytes. Acute infections diagnosed in hospital or treated in the community were associated with a markedly increased risk of VTE. The association was strongest within the first 2-4 weeks (sometimes up to 12 weeks) after infection onset and gradually declined thereafter. but remained approximately twofold higher for almost all types of infection for up to 1 year of followup. The highest risk increases associated with respiratory tract infections. According to 9th ACCP Guidelines 2012 updated by CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report 2020 for hospitalized patients with acute infection and acutely ill hospitalized medical patients with hospital-diagnosed infection, who are at increased risk of thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, low-dose unfractioned heparin (bid or tid), or fondaparinux is recommended.

However, significant renal accumulation of folate radioconjugates and hence exceedingly high emission of radiation from the kidneys may mask uptake of radioactivity at sites of interest such as small metastases in the abdominal region of animal models of ovarian cancer. Recently it was observed that the antifolate pemetrexed (PMX) reduces undesired renal uptake of radiofolates. A disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that pemetrexed is a chemotherapeutic agent which may have toxic side effects. The aims of this study were therefore to investigate whether the desired effect of PMX to reduce renal accumulation of folate radioconjugates would be maintained if it was applied as a cocktail together with its antidote, thymidine, and to explore whether thymidine was an effective rescue agent against PMX's related toxicity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro internalization of (67)Ga-EC0800 was investigated using FR-positive KB tumor cells and embryonic monkey MA104 kidney cells in the absence and presence of PMX alone and in combination with thymidine. Uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 into KB cells was increased by coincubation of the cells with PMX. In contrast uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 into MA104 cells was reduced under the same conditions. In both cell lines coincubation of thymidine did not change the results obtained with PMX. Biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging studies of (67)Ga-EC0800 were performed with KB tumor bearing mice injected with PMX alone or with a cocktail of PMX and thymidine. The radiofolate's kidney uptake reducing effect of PMX in mice was maintained also if PMX was employed together with its antidote thymidine. The tumor uptake of (67)Ga-EC0800 remained unchanged independent of the administration of PMX or a combination of PMX and thymidine. The effect of thymidine to abrogate PMX-induced cytotoxicity was demonstrated in vitro with an MTT assay using KB and MA104 cells. Cell viability was reduced to 50% (KB cells) and 70% (MA104 cells) of untreated controls if PMX (5 M and 15 M, respectively) was coincubated. Addition of thymidine (10 M or 100 M) compensated PMX's toxic effects in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of thymidine was also investigated in non-tumor bearing mice treated with high-dosed PMX. Rescue of mice with side effects after the third and fourth cycles of PMX application (1 mg/mouse) was achieved by application of thymidine (20 mg/mouse) at five consecutive days starting the day of PMX injection. Application of PMX together with thymidine as a cocktail is effective to improve the tissue distribution of radiofolates while preventing pharmacological and potentially toxic side effects of the chemotherapeutic agent PMX. These findings open new perspectives for folate-based nuclear imaging in preclinical research potentially allowing longitudinal investigations and monitoring therapies in animal models of cancer and inflammatory diseases.","output":"In vitro and in vivo evaluation of an innocuous drug cocktail to improve the quality of folic acid targeted nuclear imaging in preclinical research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak deeply impressed supply chains in different aspects. In response to this unexpected situation, supply chain managers have decided to recover and reinforce their supply chains. Considering the expanse of these decisions, project management principle and tools seems inevitable to successfully manage the transformation from before pandemic to post-pandemic supply chains (SCs). In this study, the problem of timeCcost tradeoff is extended to time, cost, and risk tradeoff. The risk factor is considered to convey the uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Since projects are affected by the level of pandemic expansion and different countries ruled out various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down), the tradeoff problem is influenced accordingly. Therefore, a scenario-based robust optimization model is proposed to deal with time, cost, and risk tradeoff problems to reflect the effects of the global pandemic of COVID-19 on managing projects in supply chains. In addition, various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down) as a prevalent response to the pandemic have been investigated separately. To illustrate the model, a real-world case study in the emerging economy of Iran is examined using the proposed approach. The results indicated that supply chain managers can use the designed model and approach as a tool for a flexible and adaptable decision-making framework dealing with a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","output":"A scenario-based robust timeCcost tradeoff model to handle the effect of COVID-19 on supply chains project management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skeletal muscle is the primary site of insulin-mediated glucose uptake through the body and, therefore, an essential contributor to glucose homeostasis maintenance. We have recently provided evidence that chronic elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration at rest [(Ca(2+))(i)] compromises glucose homeostasis in malignant hyperthermia muscle cells. To further investigate how chronic elevated muscle [Ca(2+)](i) modifies insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis, we measured [Ca(2+)](i) and glucose uptake in vivo and in vitro in intact polarized muscle cells from glucose-intolerant RYR1-p.R163C and db/db mice. Glucose-intolerant RYR1-p.R163C and db/db mice have significantly elevated muscle [Ca(2+)](i) and reduced muscle glucose uptake compared to WT muscle cells. Dantrolene treatment (1.5 mg/kg IP injection for 2 weeks) caused a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose levels and muscle [Ca(2+)](i) and increased muscle glucose uptake compared to untreated RYR1-p.R163C and db/db mice. Furthermore, RYR1-p.R163C and db/db mice had abnormal basal insulin levels and response to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In vitro experiments conducted on single muscle fibers, dantrolene improved insulin-mediated glucose uptake in RYR1-p.R163C and db/db muscle fibers without affecting WT muscle fibers. In muscle cells with chronic elevated [Ca(2+)](i), GLUT4 expression was significantly lower, and the subcellular fraction (plasma membrane/cytoplasmic) was abnormal compared to WT. The results of this study suggest that i) Chronic elevated muscle [Ca(2+)](i) decreases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and consequently causes hyperglycemia; ii) Reduced muscle [Ca(2+)](i) by dantrolene improves muscle glucose uptake and subsequent hyperglycemia; iii) The mechanism by which chronic high levels of [Ca(2+)](i) interfere with insulin action appears to involve the expression of GLUT4 and its subcellular fractionation.","output":"Chronic Elevation of Skeletal Muscle [Ca(2+)](i) Impairs Glucose Uptake.

Methods An online survey among contact lens educators (educator members of the International Association of Contact Lens Educators), conducted in May 2020. Results A total of 214 responses were received from 32 countries (representing a 39% response rate). Overall, 71% of respondents institutions were closed to students to attend at that time. A majority (58%) were delivering more online education than they would normally provide. Live online lectures and discussion was the most commonly used method (68%). Zoom was the most common videoconferencing technology (56%) and the most popular social media platform for communicating with students was WhatsApp (48%). About half (54%) were running online exams or assessments, 24% holding these for students to attend in person, and 27% were conducting practical sessions. Two in three (68%) said they would conduct more than 50% of their total teaching online by the end of 2020, and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online. Of all respondents, 74% expressed interest in an online platform delivering educational resources. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the teaching of contact lenses, as educational institutions worldwide move to online delivery.

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status. Universal anticoagulant prophylaxis in hospitalised children with SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations is not warranted, but may be offered to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk factors in the context of a multi-modal therapeutic approach.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Associated Coagulopathy And Thromboembolism Prophylaxis In Children: A Single Centre Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising ability to treat critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by regenerating lung cells and reducing immune system overreaction. However, two main challenges need to be addressed first before MSCs can be efficiently transfused to the most critical cases of COVID-19. First is the selection of suitable MSC sources that can meet the standards of stem cell criteria. Second is differentiating COVID-19 patients into different emergency levels automatically and prioritising them in each emergency level. This study presents an efficient real-time MSC transfusion framework based on multicriteria decision-making(MCDM) methods. In the methodology, the testing phase represents the ability to adhere to plastic surfaces, the upregulation and downregulation of specific surface protein markers and finally the ability to differentiate into different kinds of cells. In the development phase, firstly, two scenarios of an augmented dataset based on the medical perspective are generated to produce 80 patients with different emergency levels. Secondly, an automated triage algorithm based on a formal medical guideline is proposed for real-time monitoring of COVID-19 patients with different emergency levels (i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical) considering the improvement and deterioration procedures from one level to another. Thirdly, a unique decision matrix for each triage level (except mild) is constructed on the basis of the intersection between the evaluation criteria of each emergency level and list of COVID-19 patients. Thereafter, MCDM methods (i.e. analytic hierarchy process [AHP] and vlsekriterijumska optimizcija i kaompromisno resenje [VIKOR]) are integrated to assign subjective weights for the evaluation criteria within each triage level and then prioritise the COVID-19 patients on the basis of individual and group decision-making(GDM) contexts. Results show that: (1) in both scenarios, the proposed algorithm effectively classified the patients into four emergency levels, including mild, moderate, severe and critical, taking into consideration the improvement and deterioration cases. (2) On the basis of experts perspectives, clear differences in most individual prioritisations for patients with different emergency levels in both scenarios were found. (3) In both scenarios, COVID-19 patients were prioritised identically between the internal and external group VIKOR. During the evaluation, the statistical objective method indicated that the patient prioritisations underwent systematic ranking. Moreover, comparison analysis with previous work proved the efficiency of the proposed framework. Thus, the real-time MSC transfusion for COVID-19 patients can follow the order achieved in the group VIKOR results.","output":"Rescuing emergency cases of COVID-19 patients: An intelligent real-time MSC transfusion framework based on multicriteria decision-making methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean Diet (MD) is one of the healthy eating plans recommended to promote health and prevent chronic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries adopted restrictive measures to mitigate infection spread, which might have influenced people's lifestyle and dietary habits. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of stay-at home orders' implementation on adherence to MD. METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, and Web Of Science, the search strategy was developed using a combination of free text and mesh terms referring to COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, and MD. Studies published until March 31st, 2021 were included. We only considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and assessing modifications of adherence to the MD through validated dietary scores or any change in consumption of food categories that are typically ascribed to the MD. Data extraction, pooling and quality appraisal of the included studies, were conducted applying PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: 42 studies were retrieved. After duplicates removal, and in-blind two-step screening, 10 studies met our a priori defined inclusion criteria and were included in the review. 71.4% of the studies reporting a rate of change in adherence, measured through validated questionnaire both before and during lockdown, reported an increase, while 28.6% reported no significative changes. All included studies reporting the percentage of participants having a high adherence to the MD, based on their results on MEDAS questionnaire, before and during the lockdown, found an increase in this percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD could have raised in people undergoing lockdowns due to COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: The impact of restrictive measures on determinants of health must be monitored.

The basic clinical symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are: fever, dry cough, fatigue, muscle pain, respiratory problems, and the loss of smell or taste. Other symptoms, including those related to hearing and balance organs (hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness), are reported less frequently by patients. They are especially rarely reported as the first symptoms of this infection.

The results of the analysis suggest a possible relationship between COVID-19 and hearing loss, with no evidence of a similar relationship between this virus and the balance system. The possible existence of such a relationship should be especially remembered by hospital emergency room doctors, otolaryngologists and audiologists, especially as regards the possibility of a sudden sensironeural hearing loss as the first symptom of COVID-19.

Due to a lack of reliable disposal pathways, acid whey currently presents a major sustainability challenge to the dairy industry. The study presented in this paper proposes a solution to this issue by transforming yogurt acid whey (YAW) into potentially palatable and marketable beverages through yeast fermentation. In this study, five prototypes were developed and fermented by Kluyveromyces marxianus, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Brettanomyces claussenii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain: Hornindal kveik), and IOC Be Fruits (IOCBF) S. cerevisiae, respectively. Their fermentation profiles were characterized by changes in density, pH, cell count, and concentrations of ethanol and organic acids. The prototypes were also evaluated on 26 sensory attributes, which were generated through a training session with 14 participants. While S. cerevisiae (IOCBF) underwent the fastest fermentation (8 days) and B. claussenii the slowest (21 days), K. marxianus and S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik) showed similar fermentation rates, finishing on day 20. The change in pH of the fermentate was similar for all five strains (from around 4.45 to between 4.25 and 4.31). Cell counts remained stable throughout the fermentation for all five strains (at around 6 log colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) except in the case of S. cerevisiae (Hornindal kveik), which ultimately decreased by 1.63 log CFU/mL. B. bruxellensis was the only strain unable to utilize all of the sugars in the substrate, with residual galactose remaining after fermentation. While both S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)- and B. claussenii-fermented samples were characterized by a fruity apple aroma, the former also had an aroma characteristic of lactic acid, dairy products, bakeries and yeast. A chemical odor characteristic of petroleum, gasoline or solvents, was perceived in samples fermented by B. bruxellensis and K. marxianus. An aroma of poorly aged or rancid cheese or milk also resulted from B. bruxellensis fermentation. In terms of appearance and mouthfeel, the S. cerevisiae (IOCBF)-fermented sample was rated the cloudiest, with the heaviest body.

METHODS A methodological systematic review was undertaken to assess if, how and the extent to which systematic reviewers operationalise the guidance on the use of programme theory in considerations of socio-economic inequalities in health. Multiple databases were searched from January 2013 to May 2016. Studies were included if they were systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of an intervention and included data on SES. Two reviewers independently screened all studies, undertook quality assessment and extracted data. A narrative approach to synthesis was adopted. RESULTS A total of 37 systematic reviews were included, 10 of which were explicit in the use of terminology for 'programme theory'. Twenty-nine studies used programme theory to inform both their a priori assumptions and explain their review findings. Of these, 22 incorporated considerations of both what and how interventions do/do not work in SES groups to both predict and explain their review findings. Thirteen studies acknowledged 24 unique theoretical references to support their assumptions of what or how interventions may have different effects in SES groups. Most reviewers used supplementary evidence to support their considerations of differential effectiveness. The majority of authors outlined a programme theory in the \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Discussion\\" sections of the review to inform their assumptions or provide explanations of what or how interventions may result in differential effects within or across SES groups.

Both in Europe and in the US, the pandemic arrived earlier and recorded higher Rt values in urban regions than in intermediate and rural ones. A similar gap is also found in the data on excess mortality. In the weeks during the first phase of the pandemic, urban regions in EU countries experienced excess mortality of up to 68pp more than rural ones. We show that, during the initial days of the pandemic, territorial differences in Rt by the degree of urbanisation can be largely explained by the level of internal, inbound and outbound mobility. The differences in the spread of COVID-19 by rural-urban typology and the role of mobility are less clear during the second wave. This could be linked to the fact that the infection is widespread across territories, to changes in mobility patterns during the summer period as well as to the different containment measures which reverse the causality between mobility and Rt.","output":"Territorial differences in the spread of COVID-19 in European regions and US counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activity-tracking applications and location-based services using short-range communication (SRC) techniques have been abruptly demanded in the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for automated contact tracing. The attention from both public and policy keeps raising on related practical problems, including \\\\textit{1) how to protect data security and location privacy? 2) how to efficiently and dynamically deploy SRC Internet of Thing (IoT) witnesses to monitor large areas?} To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named \\\\textit{Bychain}. Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum monitoring coverage deployment. We implemented and evaluated the proposed blockchain protocol in the real-world using the Bluetooth 5.0. The storage, CPU utilization, power consumption, time delay, and security of each procedure and performance of activities are analyzed.

This creates significant concerns over governments transparency and accountability. This paper aims to pursue a twofold objective: assessing the patterns of open government data during the extraordinary time initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic drawing relevant policy and managerial implications regarding the future development of open data as a mechanism of accountability at times of exception. Design/methodology/approach: The study follows exploratory research, relying on a web content analysis. The empirical setting is provided by 20 Italian regional governments during the COVID-19 pandemic as a shock that has triggered an exceptional time for governments. Findings: Results on the desirable (extrinsic and intrinsic) characteristics of the data analyzed show that in the empirical setting investigated, open data does not enable to properly address the accountability concerns of a demanding forum at times of exception. Research limitations/implications: The paper enriches the state of the art on accountability and provides both scholars and practitioners (e.g. policymakers, managers, etc.) a current reading of data-driven orientation as a stimulus to the accountability of public administrations during exceptional times. Originality/value: The paper investigates open data as a condition of public accountability, assessing whether and how Italian regional governments have concretely opened their data to enable their forums to elaboration of an informed opinion about their conduct during the ongoing pandemic. This fosters the understanding of how accountability is deployed in times of exception in light of the possibilities offered by the availability of online platforms. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Open data for accountability at times of exception: an exploratory analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analysis of patients with alcohol dependence (AD) treated in intensive care units has never been performed in Poland.

Yet, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates bound many children to their available home spaces for learning, movement, and development. The exact effect this mandate had on children's physical activity may vary among families. Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children's physical activity, while also considering families' socioeconomic status. Design: Open-ended survey. Setting: Online. Method: Data were collected from 321 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children's opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children's physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children's physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policymakers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.","output":"Nowhere to Go: Parents' Descriptions of Children's Physical Activity During a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Early in the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. states implemented several different types of containment measures to slow the disease's spread. Early evidence indicates containment measures were associated with changes in individuals' mental health. This study explores the associations between U.S. state containment measures and older adults' mental health and importantly, whether the associations vary by living arrangement and gender. METHODS: The study analyzed national sample of adults aged 50 or older from 12 waves (April-July 2020) of the U.S. Household Pulse Survey (N = 394,934). State fixed-effects models linked four state containment measures (stay-at-home order, restaurant closure, bar closure, and movie theater closure) to levels of depression and anxiety across different types of living arrangements, net of controls. Men and women were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Stay-at-home order and restaurant and bar closure, but not movie theater closure, were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety in older adults. Living arrangements moderated the associations for women but not men. For women, compared to living alone, living with a spouse or intergenerational family was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression during stay-at-home order and restaurant closure. CONCLUSION: The associations between containment measures and mental health vary by type of living arrangement and were gendered, likely because household situations create different demands and supports that men and woman experience differently. Although containment measures are necessary to protect public health, paying attention to these underlying dynamics can inform policymakers' efforts to implement policies that balance harms and benefits for older adults.","output":"State containment measures, living arrangements, and mental health of U.S. older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An extensive search for active therapeutic agents against the SARS-CoV-2 is being conducted across the globe Computational docking simulations have traditionally been used for iin silicoligand design and remain popular method of choice for high-throughput screening of therapeutic agents in the fight against COVID-19 Despite the vast chemical space (millions to billions of biomolecules) that can be potentially explored as therapeutic agents, we remain severely limited in the search of candidate compounds owing to the high computational cost of these ensemble docking simulations employed in traditional iin silicoligand design Here, we present a ide novomolecular design strategy that leverages artificial intelligence to discover new therapeutic biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2 A Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm combined with a multi-task neural network (MTNN) surrogate model for expensive docking simulations and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for rollouts, is used to sample the exhaustive SMILES space of candidate biomolecules Using Vina scores as target objective to measure binding of therapeutic molecules to either the isolated spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 at its host receptor region or to the S-protein:Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interface, we generate several (~100's) new biomolecules that outperform FDA (~1000a?s) and non-FDA biomolecules (~million) from existing databases A transfer learning strategy is deployed to retrain the MTNN surrogate as new candidate molecules are identified - this iterative search and retrain strategy is shown to accelerate the discovery of desired candidates We perform detailed analysis using Lipinski's rules and also analyze the structural similarities between the various toperforming candidates We spilt the molecules using a molecular fragmenting algorithm and identify the common chemical fragments and patterns a such information is important to identify moieties that are responsible for improved performance Although we focus on therapeutic biomolecules, our Astrategy is broadly applicable for accelerated design and discovery of any chemical molecules with user-desired functionality","output":"Artificial Intelligence Guided De Novo Molecular Design Targeting COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cybersecurity affects us all in our daily lives.

Historically, Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for different kinds of technical questions, including for cybersecurity. That has been changing, however, with the advent of Security Stack Exchange, a site specifically designed for cybersecurity-related questions and answers.

To triangulate the results, we also conducted user surveys. We found that the user behavior across those three communities is different, in most cases. Likewise, cybersecurity-related questions asked on the three sites are different, more technical on Security Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow, and more subjective and personal on Reddit. Moreover, there appears to have been a differentiation of the communities along the same lines, accompanied by overall popularity trends suggestive of Stack Overflows decline and Security Stack Exchanges rise within the cybersecurity community.

OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess the differences in utilization of provider-to-provider teledermatology services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) to assess dermatology resident and faculty experiences with the integration of teledermatology into dermatology residency training at the University of Ottawa. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing provider-to-provider teledermatology consults submitted to dermatologists from April 2019 to October 2019 pre-pandemic with the same period during the pandemic in 2020. Two different questionnaires were also disseminated to the dermatology residents and faculty at our institution inquiring about their perspectives on teledermatology, education, and practice. RESULTS: The number of dermatologists completing consults, the number of providers submitting a case to Dermatology, and the number of consults initiated all increased during the pandemic period. Ninety-one percent of residents agreed that eConsults and teledermatology enhanced their residency education, enabled continuation of training during the pandemic, and that eConsult-based training should be incorporated into the curriculum. Ninety-six percent of staff incorporated a virtual dermatology practice model, and one-third used teledermatology with residents during the pandemic. Most staff felt there was value in providing virtual visits in some capacity during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the use of teledermatology services continues to increase accessibility during the pandemic.

Methods From January 30, 2020 to March 23, 2020, we conducted a non-randomised controlled trial, in which all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to three groups non-randomly and given supportive treatments: Group A, Lopinavir-Ritonavir; Group B,Huashi Baidu Formula(a Chinese medicineformula made by the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to treatCOVID-19, which is now in the clinical trial period) and Lopinavir-Ritonavir; and Group C, Huashi Baidu Formula. The use of antibiotics, antiviruses, and corticosteroids was permitted in Group A and B. Traditional Chinese medicine injections were permitted in Group C. The primary outcomes were clinical remission time (interval from admission to the first time the patient tested negatively for novel coronavirus or an obvious improvement was observed from chest CT) and clinical remission rate (number of patients whose clinical time was within 16 days/total number of patients) Results A total of 60 adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at sites in Wuhan, China, and the sample size of each group was 20. In Groups A, B and C, the clinical remission rates were95.0%(19/20), 100.0%(20/20) and 100.0%(20/20), respectively. Compared with Groups A and B, the clinical remission time of Group C was significantly shorter (5.9 days vs. 10.8 days, P < 0.050; 5.9 days vs. 9.7 days, P < 0.050).

Methods: Patients with a corneal decompensation risk who underwent AGV implantation at a single institution were included in this retrospective study. The patients' preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and the number of anti-glaucomatous eye drop medications used was compared with postoperative values. The success criteria were defined as a postoperative IOP of 5 to 21 mmHg and no loss of light perception. Results: Twenty-three eyes of 23 (16 male, 7 female) patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 64.614.6 years and the mean follow-up period was 15.88.3 months. The preoperative mean IOP was reduced from 33.69.1 mmHg to 16.95.1 mmHg at the last follow-up (p=0.000). The mean preoperative number of anti-glaucomatous eye drop medications used was 3.51.3. Postoperatively the mean was 1.71.4 at the last follow-up (p=0.000). The rate of total success was determined to be 78%. The postoperative mean BCVA did not change significantly.

Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop new therapies to control, treat and prevent this disease. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) of the viral host are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication, and building an antiviral cellular defense. Here, we have analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, we have analyzed the potency of anti-miR-155 therapy in a COVID-19 mouse model (mice transgenic for human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2)). We report for the first time that miR-155 expression is elevated in COVID-19 patients. Further, our data indicate that the viral load as well as miR-155 levels are higher in male relative to female patients. Moreover, we find that the delivery of anti-miR-155 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 effectively suppresses miR-155 expression, and leads to improved survival and clinical scores. Importantly, anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 not only exhibit reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also have increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the lungs.

Two common African gene variants of APOL1, G1 and G2, protect against infection by species of trypanosomes that resist wild-type APOL1. At the same time, the protection predisposes humans to CKD, an elegant example of balanced polymorphism. However, the exact mechanism of APOL1-mediated podocyte damage is not clear, including APOL1's subcellular localization, topology, and whether the damage is related to trypanolysis. METHODS: APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and in kidney podocytes was mapped with flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and trypanolysis assays that tracked 170 APOL1 domain-specific monoclonal antibodies. APOL1 knockout podocytes confirmed antibody specificity. RESULTS: APOL1 localizes to the surface of podocytes, with most of the pore-forming domain (PFD) and C terminus of the Serum Resistance Associated-interacting domain (SRA-ID), but not the membrane-addressing domain (MAD), being exposed. In contrast, differential trypanolytic blocking activity reveals that the MAD is exposed in serum APOL1, with less of the PFD accessible. Low pH did not detectably alter the gross topology of APOL1, as determined by antibody accessibility, in serum or on podocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our antibodies highlighted different conformations of native APOL1 topology in serum (HDL particles) and at the podocyte surface.

Lockdown imposes periods of social isolation that contributes to increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and worry. We examined whether lockdowns have similar psychosocial associations across rural and urban areas and whether associations existed between happiness and worry of loneliness in the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Data were collected using the COVID-19 Living Survey between 13 and 20 May 2020 by BehaviourWorks Australia at the Monash Sustainable Development Institute. The mean self-reported feeling of happiness and anxiousness (N = 1593), on a 10-point Likert scale with 0 being least happy or highly anxious, was 6.5 (SD = 2.4) and 3.9 (2.9), respectively. Factors associated with happiness were older age and having a postgraduate education. Participants worried about becoming lonely also exhibited reduced happiness (estimate = ?1.58, 95%CI = ?1.84C?1.32) and higher anxiousness (2.22, 1.93C2.51) scores, and these conditions remained associated after adjusting for demographics. Interestingly, worry about loneliness was greater in rural areas than in urban communities. The negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on rural youth and those less-educated was evident. Participants in rural Australia who were worried about becoming lonely were reportedly less happy than participants in major cities. This dataset provides a better understanding of factors that influence psychological well-being and quality of life in the Australian population and helps to determine whether happiness may be an associative factor that could mitigate self-feelings of anxiety and worry about loneliness.","output":"Associations of the Initial COVID-19 Lockdown on Self-Reported Happiness and Worry about Developing Loneliness: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Rural, Regional, and Urban Australian Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early prediction of disease progression in COVID-19 patients can be helpful for personalized therapy, as well as the optimal allocation of public health resources. Objectives: This study aimed to present predictive models for identifying potential high-risk COVID-19 patients upon hospital ad-mission, based on the examination of clinical and radiological features by radiologists and artificial intelligence (AI). Patients and Methods: A total of 786 initially non-severe COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled in this study between January 2 and May 28, 2020. The patients were randomly divided into training (n = 628, 80%) and test (n = 158, 20%) groups. Clinical factors, laboratory indicators, and radiologist-and AI-extracted radiological features of pneumonia lesions were determined using a convolution neural network. The features were selected based on the Boruta algorithm with five-fold cross-validation. Four mod-els, including a model based on clinical findings (model C), a model based on the physicians examination of radiological features (R-Doc model), a model based on AI-derived radiological features (R-AI model), and an AI-based model mimicking the physicians examinations (AI-Mimic-Doc model), were constructed for predicting COVID-19 progression upon admission, using a logistic regres-sion analysis. The predictive performance of the four models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and then compared using the DeLong test. Results: Overall, 238 out of 786 patients (30.3%) progressed into severe or critical pneumonia during the 14-day follow-up. Nine clinical findings, 17 laboratory indicators, 48 physician-extracted radiological features of pneumonia lesions, and 126 AI-driven radiological features were collected. The urea, albumin level, and lesion size in the basal segment of the right lower lobe of the lung or the proportion of CT values in the range of-200-60 in the left lung were the representative features for constructing the R-Doc and R-AI models, respectively. Comparison of the R-Doc model (AUC: 0.840, 95% CI: 0.747-0.933 for the training set and 0.731, 95% CI: 0.606-0.857 for the test set) with the R-AI model (AUC: 0.803, 95% CI: 0.701-0.906 for the training set and AUC: 0.731, 95% CI: 0.606-0.857 for the validation set) indicated a marginal difference in identifying patients at risk of progression to pneumonia upon admission (P < 0.1). The R-AI model was superior to model C, with an AUC of 0.770 for the training set (95% CI: 0.657-0.882) and 0.666 for the validation set to identify high-risk non-severe cases upon admission. Conclusion: By using radiological features along with blood tests, early identification of COVID-19 patients, who are at risk of disease progression, can be achieved on admission (rapidly by using AI);therefore, the use of these features can contribute to the clinical management of COVID-19. ? 2022, Author(s).","output":"Early Identification of COVID-19 Progression to Its Severe Form Using Artificial Intelligence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We experienced a case with multiple arterial and venous thromboses associated with COVID\\\\19.

Immune-mediated disorders are also a differential in encephalitis cases. We investigated the clinical characteristics and potential aetiological agents of unexplained encephalitis through metagenomic next-generation sequencing of residual clinical samples of multiple tissue types and independent clinical review. A total of 43 specimens, from both sterile and non-sterile sites, were collected from 18 encephalitis cases with no cause identified by the Australian Childhood Encephalitis study. Samples were subjected to total RNA sequencing to determine the presence and abundance of potential pathogens, to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes, and epidemiological origins, and to describe the possible aetiologies of unexplained encephalitis. From this, we identified five RNA and two DNA viruses associated with human infection from both non-sterile (nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose/throat swabs, urine, stool rectal swab) and sterile (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) sites. These comprised two human rhinoviruses, two human seasonal coronaviruses, two polyomaviruses and one picobirnavirus. With the exception of picobirnavirus all have been previously associated with respiratory disease. Human rhinovirus and seasonal coronaviruses may be responsible for five of the encephalitis cases reported here. Immune-mediated encephalitis was considered clinically likely in six cases and RNA sequencing did not identify a possible pathogen in these cases. The aetiology remained unknown in nine cases. Our study emphasises the importance of respiratory viruses in the aetiology of unexplained child encephalitis and suggests that the routine inclusion of non-CNS sampling in encephalitis clinical guidelines/protocols could improve the diagnostic yield. Author Summary Encephalitis is caused by both infectious agents and auto-immune disorders. However, the aetiological agents, including viruses, remain unknown in around half the cases of encephalitis in many cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic tests are usually based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid which may limit their utility. We used a combination of meta-transcriptomic sequencing and independent clinical review to identify the potential causative pathogens in cases of unexplained childhood encephalitis. Accordingly, we identified seven viruses associated with both sterile and non-sterile sampling sites. Human rhinovirus and seasonal coronaviruses were considered as most likely responsible for five of the 18 encephalitis cases studied, while immune-mediated encephalitis was considered the cause in six cases, and we were unable to determine the aetiology in nine cases. Overall, we demonstrate the role of respiratory viruses as a cause of unexplained encephalitis and that sampling sites other than cerebrospinal fluid is of diagnostic value.","output":"Diagnosis and analysis of unexplained cases of childhood encephalitis in Australia using metagenomic next-generation sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 disease has caused a world-wide pandemic with more than 60 million positive cases and more than 1.4 million deaths by the end of November 2020. As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined.","output":"Prediction of Covid-19 spreading and optimal coordination of counter-measures: From microscopic to macroscopic models to Pareto fronts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges for the management of patients with cancer. In our institution, we adapted our delivery of outpatient systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) by introducing a number of risk-reducing measures including pre-assessment screening. AIMS: We sought to evaluate the experience and perceptions of patients with cancer undergoing SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients on SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic were eligible for participation. Data were collected by anonymous survey over a 1 week period during the most intensive phase of government restrictions. Patients were asked questions under three headings: perceived risk of infection exposure, changes to treatment plan and psychological impact of Covid-19. RESULTS: One hundred patients were assessed, 60% were male, 41% were > 65 years of age and 67% had advanced cancer. Eleven percent of patients were living alone. Fifty-seven percent reported feeling at increased risk in general of contracting Covid-19. Sixty-eight percent of patients did not feel worried about contracting Covid-19 in the hospital. Ninety-two percent of patients reported wanting to continue on SACT as originally planned. Fifty-eighty percent felt isolated and 40% reported increased anxiety. CONCLUSION: Though patients on active treatment for cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic reported increased anxiety and feelings of isolation due to Covid-19, the majority of patients wanted to continue SACT as originally planned.

Docking studies were used to find the actual conformations of chemicals in active site of HIV-1 protease. Then the molecular descriptors were calculated from these conformations. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) were used as QSAR models, respectively.

We investigated whether changes in eating status (eating alone or with others) in late-life affected cognitive decline in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We used data from the Survey of the Living Conditions and Welfare Needs of Korean Older Persons. Nutritional risk, including eating status, was assessed using seven questions from the Nutrition Screening Initiative checklist, and cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). On the basis of changes in eating status between baseline (2008) and the 3-year follow-up (2011), the subjects were divided into four groups: group 1 (eating with others at both surveys), group 2 (eating alone in 2008 and eating with others in 2011), group 3 (eating with others in 2008 and eating alone in 2011), and group 4 (eating alone at both surveys). Generalized linear models were used to compare the changes in MMSE scores over the 3-year period among the four groups. RESULTS: Among older women, group 2 had the least decline in MMSE scores (-0.550.46), whereas group 3 had the greatest decline (-1.760.37) (p=0.034). We observed no difference in the change in MMSE scores among the four eating groups in older men. CONCLUSION: Deprivation of mealtime partners in late life showed significant cognitive decline compared with gaining mealtime partners.

Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of every cytokine towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. Delineation of the roles of cytokines during COVID-19 holds the key to efficient patient management in clinics. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical care. MAIN METHODS: Scientific literature was searched to identify 13 cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF- and IFN-) from 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for selected 6 cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN- between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. KEY FINDINGS: Out of the 13 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates.

METHODS: (1) A bench study measured the impact of two filters with different mechanical properties on CPAP performances, and pressures were also measured in patients. (2) Non-ICU healthcare staff working in COVID-19 intermediate care units were trained with a video tutorial posted on a massive open online course. (3) A clinical study assessed the feasibility and safety of using FF-CPAP to maintain oxygenation and manage patients out of the ICU during a massive outbreak. RESULTS: Bench assessments showed that adding a filter did not affect the effective pressure delivered to the patient. The resistive load induced by the filter variably increased the simulated patients work of breathing (6C34%) needed to sustain the tidal volume, depending on the filters resistance, respiratory mechanics and basal inspiratory effort. In patients, FF-CPAP achieved pressures similar to those obtained on the bench. The massive training tool provided precious information on the use of Boussignac FF-CPAP on COVID-19 patients. Then 85 COVID-19 patients with ICU admission criteria over a 1-month period were studied upon FF-CPAP initiation for AHRF. FF-CPAP significantly decreased respiratory rate and increased SpO(2). Thirty-six (43%) patients presented with respiratory indications for intubation prior to FF-CPAP initiation, and 13 (36%) of them improved without intubation. Overall, 31 patients (36%) improved with FF-CPAP alone and 17 patients (20%) did not require ICU admission. Patients with a respiratory rate > 32 breaths/min upon FF-CPAP initiation had a higher cumulative probability of intubation (p < 0.001 by log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Adding a filter to the Boussignac valve does not affect the delivered pressure but may variably increase the resistive load depending on the filter used. Clinical assessment suggests that FF-CPAP is a frugal solution to provide a ventilatory support and improve oxygenation to numerous patients suffering from AHRF in the context of a massive outbreak.

METHODS: AYA enrolled in the RECOVERY study, a pre-existing web-based longitudinal study, and completed a COVID-19-specific survey (n = 89). We examined bivariate associations of four markers of care: i) access to care, ii) changes in care, iii) perceived disruption to care, and iv) quality of care. Using multiple logistic regression, we examined the associations of pandemic-related markers of care with changes in ED thoughts and behaviors. We excluded those not engaged in treatment pre-pandemic (n = 16). RESULTS: In the remaining 73 participants, reported access to care was high, with 92% of respondents continuing care with at least one ED provider during the pandemic; however, 47% stopped some treatment during the pandemic. Nearly one-third (32%) perceived a disruption in treatment. Quality of care remained high with 67% reporting care to be better than or as good as pre-pandemic.

In the UK, scientists were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike (S) target using a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). METHODS: To control and study the current coronavirus pandemic, it is important to develop a rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work, we designed primer sets specific to the VOC (202012/01) to be used by SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion mutations 69/70 in the spike and the 106/107/108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20 samples from positive patients, detected by using the Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) that included the ORF1ab, S, and N gene targets. 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile (negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets) and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile. RESULTS: Our results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the mutations 69/70 and 106/107/108. This protocol could be used as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in patients who were already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results for S-gene.

Menkes disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the ATP7A gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type Atpase. To develop therapeutic approaches in affected patients, we have identified a zebrafish model of Menkes disease termed calamity that results from splicing defects in the zebrafish orthologue of the ATP7A gene. Embryonic-recessive lethal mutants have impaired copper homeostasis that results in absent melanin pigmentation, impaired notochord formation, and hindbrain neurodegeneration. In this current study, we have attempted to rescue these striking phenotypic alterations by using a series of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides directed against the splice-site junctions of two mutant calamity alleles. Our findings reveal a robust and complete correction of the copper-deficient defects of calamity in association with the generation of the WT Menkes protein in all rescued mutants. Interestingly, a quantitative analysis of atp7a-specific transcripts suggests that competitive translational regulation may account for the synthesis of WT protein in these embryos. This in vivo correction of Menkes disease through the rescue of aberrant splicing may provide therapeutic options in this fatal disease and illustrates the potential for zebrafish models of human genetic disease in the development of treatments based on the principles of interactions of synthetic oligonucleotide analogues with mRNA.","output":"In vivo correction of a Menkes disease model using antisense oligonucleotides."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ritter argues that almost 80% of Australians were impacted by the unprecedented climate damage fires of the 2019-20 spring and summer An extreme environmental phenomenon became a mass societal experience, killing more than 30 people directly, contributing to the early deaths of more than 400 others through extreme toxic smoke inhalation and impacting one way or another the lives of around 80% of Australians Then another socio-environmental event--the zoonotic transmission and anthropogenic spread of the COVID-19 virus--became a universal experience as the whole of Australia went into protracted lockdown","output":"Under the Currawong's Eye: Fire, pandemic and the bridge to hope 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The pace of the COVID-19 vaccine development process is unprecedented and is challenging the traditional paradigm of vaccinology science.

To overcome this limitation, pseudotyped viruses have been developed as an alternative for the live SARS-CoV-2. However, one of the issues that we and others have encountered during the production of pseudotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was the low virus yield. In our own experience, we were only able initially to produce a stock with a virus titer that is more than two orders of magnitude lower than what we usually get with a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vector. We have conducted a series of improvements, including using a C-terminal truncated form of spike protein and a D614G mutated spike. Together, these have led to a significant improvement in the yield of the pseudotyped virus.

BACKGROUND. An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9  14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was used to screen out independent risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. By multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis, we further determined the associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and potential risk factors. All patients had two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests with 33 days of median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (interquartile range: 25.2C39 days). LASSO and binomial logistic regression analyses suggested that delayed hospital admission (adjusted OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 1.82C7.50), hypokalemia, and subpleural lesion (adjusted OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.10C16.97) were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

These groups may not benefit from traditional HIV prevention interventions available at the health facilities where they live, but may benefit from services offered at public venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners (e.g. bars, nightclubs, transportation hubs and guest houses). The goal of this analysis was to estimate availability, access and uptake of prevention services by populations who visit these venues. METHODS We collected cross-sectional data using the Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts sampling method at cross-border locations near or along the land and lake borders of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from June 2016-February 2017. This bio-behavioural survey captured information from a probability sample of 11,428 individuals at 833 venues across all areas. Data were weighted using survey sampling weights and analysed using methods to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS Among the 85.6% of persons who had access to condoms, 60.5% did not use a condom at their last anal or vaginal sexual encounter. Venues visited by high percentages of persons living with HIV were not more likely than other venues to offer condoms. In 12 of the 22 cross-border areas, male or female condoms were available at less than 33% of the venues visited by persons having difficulty accessing condoms. In 17 of the 22 cross-border areas, education outreach visits in the preceding six months occurred at less than 50% of the venues where participants had low effective use of condoms. CONCLUSIONS Individuals visiting venues in cross-border areas report poor access to and low effective use of condoms and other prevention services. Availability of HIV prevention services differed by venue and population type and cross-border area, suggesting opportunities for more granular targeting of HIV prevention interventions and transnational coordination of HIV programming.","output":"Access to HIV prevention services in East African cross-border areas: a 2016-2017 cross-sectional bio-behavioural study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CoronaSurveys is an ongoing interdisciplinary project developing a system to infer the incidence of COVID-19 around the world using anonymous open surveys.

To explore the possible mechanism contributing to the persistent infection, we investigated immune responses. The six cases had comparable specific antibodies with other 24 non-persistent asymptomatic cases, but they had significantly lower antibody levels than symptomatic cases. Although the virus-specific memory B and T cells were detected in the three groups of cases, the six cases showed an upregulation of CD4 regulatory T cells, which was negatively correlated with low levels of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0a??%, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0a??%, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappaa??=a??0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8a??% (11/16), 77.8a??% (7/9), 100.0a??% (2/2), specificity of 85.7a??% (12/14), 76.2a??% (16/21), 92.9a??% (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7a??% (23/30), 76.7a??% (23/30), 93.3a??% (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION: Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","output":"Nicht-invasive Beurteilung von pulmonalen L?sionen bei Patienten mit Coronavirus-Erkrankung (COVID-19) durch Ultraschall direkt am Krankenbett./ A Clinical Study of Noninvasive Assessment of Lung Lesions in Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) by Bedside Ultrasound"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"De groeiende vraag naar online therapie voor kinderen, jongeren en gezinnen tijdens de coronapandemie heeft ons voor nieuwe uitdagingen gesteld.

Silencing NRP-1 enhanced the transmission of HIV-1 in macrophages and DCs significantly and increased the infectivity of the virions produced by these cells. We further demonstrated that NRP-1 was packaged into the progeny virions to inhibit their ability to attach to target cells, thus reducing the infectivity of the virions. These data indicate that NRP-1 is a newly identified antiviral protein highly produced in both macrophages and DCs that inhibit HIV-1 infectivity; thus, NRP-1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","output":"Neuropilin-1, a myeloid cell-specific protein, is an inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of low and high-level models of general rough sets can be used to represent knowledge.

We aimed to report ceiling of care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) decisions and their association with demographic and clinical characteristics as well as outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Retrospective, observational study conducted between 5 th March and 7 th May 2020 of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Ceiling of care and CPR decisions were documented using the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) process. Unadjusted and multivariate regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with ceiling of care decisions and death during hospitalisation. Results: A total of 485 patients were included, of whom 409 (843%) had a documented ceiling of care which was level one for 208 (509%), level two for 75 (183%) and level three for 126 (308%). CPR decisions were documented for 451 (930%) and 336 (745%) were not for resuscitation. Advanced age, frailty, White-European ethnicity, a diagnosis of any co-morbidity and receipt of cardiovascular medications were associated with ceiling of care decisions. In a multivariate model only advanced age (odds 089, 086-093 p <0001), frailty (odds 048, 038-060, p<0001) and the cumulative number of co-morbidities (odds 072, 052-10, p=0048) were independently associated. Death during hospitalisation was independently associated with age, frailty and requirement for level two or three care. Conclusion: Ceiling of care decisions were made for the majority of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, broadly in line with known predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19, but with a focus on co-morbidities suggesting ICU admission might not be a reliable end-point for observational studies where advanced care planning is routine.","output":"Advanced care planning during the COVID-19 pandemic: ceiling of care decisions and their implications for observational data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present automatically parameterised Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), for encrypted neural network inference.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic radically impacts our lives, while the evolution dynamics of COVID-19 remain obscure. A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed over the last three months (up to 3/22/2020) in China. The model results revealed that 1) the transmission, infection and recovery dynamics follow the integral-order SEIR model with significant spatiotemporal variations in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China, and 2) the evolution of number of deaths follows the time FDE, likely due to the time memory in the death toll. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. In addition, a time FDE model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the FDE model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread. Therefore, caution is needed when applying FDEs to model the coronavirus outbreak, since specific COVID-19 kinetics may not exhibit nonlocal behavior. Particularly, the spread of COVID-19 may be affected by the rapid improvement of health care systems which may remove the memory impact in COVID-19 dynamics (resulting in a short-tailed recovery curve), while the death toll and mitigation of COVID-19 can be captured by the time FDEs due to the nonlocal, memory impact in fatality and human activities.","output":"Applicability of time fractional derivative models for simulating the dynamics and mitigation scenarios of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute lower respiratory tract infection is a common acute infection managed in primary care. The current dominant management strategy in the UK is antibiotics, despite widespread publicity regarding antimicrobial resistance and evidence that the small benefits of antibiotics do not outweigh the harms. There is a need to address the rising problem of antibiotic resistance by providing credible alternative strategies, which reduce symptom burden. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Pelargonium sidoides root extract in order to warrant undertaking an independent clinical trial. We propose a feasibility study to demonstrate our ability to recruit and retain patients and conduct a placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs?7630 in lower respiratory tract infection where pneumonia is not suspected. Both the tablet and liquid formulations will be included. METHODS: The HATRIC trial is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study aiming to determine the potential to conduct a fully powered trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract as an alternative to the inappropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis in UK primary care. Primary care sites will be equally randomised to one of two formulation groups (tablet or liquid preparation). Additionally, within each site, patients will be evenly randomised to active or placebo treatment.

When the flight landed, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Quarantine Station in Honolulu alerted passengers that a suspected case of measles had been identified, but they were not detained. The next day, to offer appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis, the Hawai'i Department of Health (HDOH) attempted to contact all passengers from the flight using information from the airline, U.S. Customs declaration forms, and tour agencies. Of 335 total passengers, 270 (81%) were successfully reached and provided complete information. The mean time from exposure to contact for all respondents was 61 hours (95% confidence interval 57, 66). A total of 202 (75%) of the responding passengers were contacted within 72 hours after exposure, the time period during which administration of measles vaccine would have provided protection for susceptible individuals. The time-to-contact was significantly longer for passengers who did not stay in hotels than for hotel guests. Customs forms proved to be of limited utility in contacting international travelers.

The objective of this study was to describe the number of beneficiaries prescribed these medications, provider specialty and regional trends in prescribing, and the aggregate costs for these claims in Medicare Part D. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using publicly available Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber data for years 2013C2019. Descriptive statistics and the Cochrane-Armitage test were used to summarize the trends. RESULTS: Overall, 30.1%, 25.6%, 4.6% of Medicare Part D beneficiaries had a proton pump inhibitor, benzodiazepine, and antipsychotic claim in 2013, respectively. These rates decreased to 27.5%, 17.5%, 4.1% in 2019 (p-value < 0.0001). However, the number of standardized 30-day claims increased from 63 million in 2013 to 84 million in 2019 for proton pump inhibitors, remained steady for benzodiazepines and slightly increased (10 million to 13 million) for antipsychotics. Total aggregate costs decreased by almost $1.5 billion for proton pump inhibitor, $100 million for benzodiazepine, and $700 million for antipsychotic from 2013 to 2019 (p-value < 0.0001). Almost 93% of gastroenterologists prescribed a proton pump inhibitor, and 60% of psychiatrists prescribed benzodiazepines and antipsychotics all seven years. The Other region had the highest percentage of providers prescribing all three classes and the highest number of standardized 30-day benzodiazepine claims. CONCLUSIONS: The overall rate of use of proton pump inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics decreased from 2013C2019 among Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Despite the increase in raw number of standardized 30-day claims, the costs decreased which is likely due to generics made available. These prescribing trends may aid in identifying and targeting potential deprescribing interventions.","output":"Prescribing trends of proton pump inhibitors, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines of medicare part d providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a real challenge for health-care systems worldwide. Male sex, older age and the coexistence of chronic comorbidities have been described as the most relevant conditions associated with a worse prognosis. Early reports suggested that hypertension might represent a risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, a more severe course of COVID-19 and increased COVID-19-related deaths. Nevertheless, the independent role of hypertension remains under debate, since hypertension is often associated with the older age and other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in the general population, which may also contribute to the SARS-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19. Moreover, the role of antihypertensive drugs, primarily angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) in COVID-19 development and outcome appears controversial. Indeed, preclinical studies using these classes of drugs have suggested a potential upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is the key binding receptor promoting cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the organism. ReninCangiotensin system (RAS) blockers may potentially upregulate ACE2, hence, it has been initially hypothesized that these agents might contribute to a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progressive course of COVID-19. However, several clinical reports do not support a detrimental role of RAS blockers in COVID-19, and an intense debate about the withdrawal or maintenance of chronic therapy with ACEi/ARB has been developed. In this review we will discuss the available evidence on the role of hypertension and antihypertensive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 development.","output":"Hypertension and COVID-19: Current Evidence and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the content, quality and value of feedback given to applicants who applied to one of four research programmes in the UK funded (or jointly funded) by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). METHODS: A mixed-method phased approach was conducted using document analysis and an online survey. Phase 1 examined 114 NIHR applicant feedback documents comprised written feedback from funding committees and external peer-reviewers and a conceptual framework of the key components of feedback was developed using content analysis. Phase 2 was an online survey completed by 113 NIHR applicants. Frequencies of responses to closed questions were calculated. Perceptions of quality and value of feedback were identified using content analysis of open-text responses. RESULTS: In phase 1, a conceptual framework was developed with seven overarching categories: Study structure and quality; Team and infrastructure; Acceptability to patients and professionals; Study justification and design; Risks and contingencies; Outputs; Value for money. A higher frequency of feedback was provided at stage 2 and for successful applications across the majority of components. In phase 2, frequency data showed that opinion on feedback was dependent on funding outcome. Content analysis revealed four main themes: Committee transparency; Content validity and reliability; Additional support; Recognition of effort and constraints. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides key insights and understanding into the quality, content and value of feedback provided to NIHR applicants. The study identified key areas for improvement that can arise in NIHR funding applications, as well as in the feedback given to applicants that are applicable to other funding organisations.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to examine the availability of telehealth services at outpatient mental health treatment facilities in the United States at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify facility-level characteristics and state-level policies associated with the availability. RESEARCH DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: All outpatient mental health treatment facilities (N=8860) listed in the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on April 16, 2020. MEASURES: Primary outcome is whether an outpatient mental health treatment facility reported offering telehealth services. RESULTS: Approximately 43% of outpatient mental health facilities in the United States reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Facilities located in the United States South and nonmetropolitan counties were more likely to offer services, as were facilities with public sector ownership, those providing care for both children and adults, and those accepting Medicaid as a form of payment. Outpatient mental health treatment facilities located in states with state-wide shelter-in-place laws were less likely to offer telehealth, as well as facilities in counties with more COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than half of outpatient mental health treatment facilities were providing telehealth services.

Recently, the pedicled nasoseptal flap has undergone many modifications and eventually proved to be valuable and efficient. However, using these nasoseptal flaps in all patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery, including those who had none or only minor CSF leakage, appears to be overly invasive and time-consuming. METHODS Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal tumor surgery within a 5 year-period were reviewed. Since 2009, we classified the intraoperative CSF leakage into grades from 0 to 3. Sellar floor reconstruction was tailored to each leak grade. We did not use any tissue grafts such as abdominal fat and did not include any procedures of CSF diversions such as lumbar drainage. RESULTS Among 200 cases in 188 patients (147 pituitary adenoma and 41 other pathologies), intraoperative CSF leakage was observed in 27.4% of 197 cases : 14.7% Grade 1, 4.6% Grade 2a, 3.0% Grade 2b, and 5.1% Grade 3. Postoperative CSF leakage was observed in none of the cases. Septal bone buttress was used for Grade 1 to 3 leakages instead of any other foreign materials. Pedicled nasoseptal flap was used for Grades 2b and 3 leakages. Unused septal bones and nasoseptal flaps were repositioned. CONCLUSION Modified classification of intraoperative CSF leaks and tailored repair technique in a multilayered fashion using an en-bloc harvested septal bone and vascularized nasoseptal flaps is an effective and reliable method for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks.","output":"Modified Graded Repair of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks in Endoscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has caused Malaysian education institutions to embrace online learning due to the Movement Control Order (MCO) and closure of universities. By adopting the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, this study aims to identify the factors influencing students attitudes to continue online learning. Since attitude can influence behaviours, the lecturers must stimulate a positive attitude among students during the online learning sessions. The study also looked into the potential of student satisfaction and performance as a mediating variable. A purposive sampling method was employed in the study, and 1349 data were gathered using an online survey. The data were analysed using a structural equation modelling with Smart Partial Least Squares. The results indicate that perceived ease to use positively affected satisfaction and performance;satisfaction and performance were confirmed to positively related to attitude. Satisfaction and performance explain 69.8% of the variance of attitude. Data analysis also revealed that performance and satisfaction mediated the relationship between perceived ease to use and attitude. These findings suggest that the universitys top management must foster a positive attitude among students to continue to use online learning to prevent COVID-19 from spreading on campus. The present study limited the variables studied to ease of use, satisfaction, and performance of science students at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu.

BackgroundPublished case reports suggest a possible association between various otologic symptoms and the COVID-19 vaccines, but the only published analysis of VAERS data, which did not account for underreporting of late-appearing adverse events, found no association between hearing loss and the vaccines. MethodsThe incidence in VAERS of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and Bells palsy associated with COVID-19 vaccinations administered between December 14, 2020 and June 7, 2021 was compared with published rates for the general population. To account for underreporting of late-appearing adverse events, incidences were calculated using only the initial part of the observation period, during which reported events spike above expected events. ResultsThe COVID-19 vaccines were associated with statistically significant increases in the incidence of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and Bells palsy of 1877, 50, 12, and 14 cases per 100,000, respectively.

A proper inflammatory response can maintain homeostasis, but continuous inflammation can cause many chronic inflammatory diseases. To properly treat inflammatory disorders, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of inflammation need to be fully elucidated. Pyroptosis is an inflammation-related cell death program, that is different from other types of cell death. Pyroptosis plays crucial roles in host defense against infections through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and cell lysis. Accumulating evidence indicates that pyroptosis is associated with inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, pneumonia, and colonitis. Furthermore, pyroptosis is also closely involved in cancers that develop as a result of inflammation, such as liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer. Here, we review the function and mechanism of pyroptosis in inflammatory disease development and provide a comprehensive description of the potential role of pyroptosis in inflammatory diseases.","output":"Cell pyroptosis in health and inflammatory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To analyze characteristics of asymptomatic/pres-ymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS: The proportion of normal chest CT in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were 35.4% (17/48) and 3.3%(2/61), respectively (P< 0.001). In 17 asymptomatic patients, their images of chest CT maintained normal during the whole course of diseases, while the normal images of chest CT in 2 pre-symptomatic patients progressed to abnormal later (P< 0.001). All the six asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection maintained unilateral lesion, while the proportion was 29.4%(5/17) in pre-symptomatic patients(P= 0.003).

In the IRONHEART study, we aimed to find out whether a modified in vitro clot lysis assay method, that includes the effect of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) might predict ICH outcomes. Patients and Methods: In this prospective, observational study, 89 consecutive non-traumatic ICH patients were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included aneurysm rupture, cancer, liver- or kidney failure or hemorrhagic diathesis. On admission, detailed clinical and laboratory investigations were performed. ICH volume was estimated based on CT performed on admission, day 14 and 90. A conventional in vitro clot lysis assay (CLA) and a modified CLA (mCLA) including cell-free-DNA and histones were performed from stored platelet-free plasma taken on admission. Clot formation and lysis in case of both assays were defined using the following variables calculated from the turbidimetric curves: maximum absorbance, time to maximum absorbance, clot lysis times (CLT) and area under the curve (CLA AUC). Long-term ICH outcomes were defined 90 days post-event by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). All patients or relatives provided written informed consent. Results: Patients with more severe stroke (NIHSS>10) presented significantly shorter clot lysis times of the mCLA in the presence of DNA and histone as compared to patients with milder stroke [10%CLT: NIHSS 0C10: median 31.5 (IQR: 21.0C40.0) min vs. NIHSS>10: 24 (18C31.0) min, p = 0.032]. Shorter clot lysis times of the mCLA showed significant association with non-survival by day 14 and with unfavorable long-term outcomes [mRS 0C1: 36.0 (22.5.0C51.0) min; mRS 2C5: 23.5 (18.0C36.0) min and mRS 6: 22.5 (18.0C30.5) min, p = 0.027]. Estimated ICH volume showed significant negative correlation with mCLA parameters, including 10%CLT (r = ?0.3050, p = 0.009).

Roadmaps provide a blueprint for implementation of priority solutions for the principal cardiovascular diseases leading to death and disability. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of these conditions and is an increasing problem due to ageing of the worlds population and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors that predispose to AF. The goal of the AF roadmap was to provide guidance on priority interventions that are feasible in multiple countries, and to identify roadblocks and potential strategies to overcome them. Since publication of the AF Roadmap in 2017, there have been many technological advances including devices and artificial intelligence for identification and prediction of unknown AF, better methods to achieve rhythm control, and widespread uptake of smartphones and apps that could facilitate new approaches to healthcare delivery and increasing community AF awareness. In addition, the World Health Organisation added the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the Essential Medicines List, making it possible to increase advocacy for their widespread adoption as therapy to prevent stroke. These advances motivated the WHF to commission a 2020 AF Roadmap update. Three years after the original Roadmap publication, the identified barriers and solutions were judged still relevant, and progress has been slow. This 2020 Roadmap update reviews the significant changes since 2017 and identifies priority areas for achieving the goals of reducing death and disability related to AF, particularly targeted at low-middle income countries. These include advocacy to increase appreciation of the scope of the problem; plugging gaps in guideline management and prevention through physician education, increasing patient health literacy, and novel ways to increase access to integrated healthcare including mHealth and digital transformations; and greater emphasis on achieving practical solutions to national and regional entrenched barriers.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. DESIGN: Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. RESULTS: Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo + AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.","output":"Effect of amino acids on IGF1 gene expression in human myotubes and skeletal muscle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy of the antiviral agent, remdesivir, versus standard-of-care treatment in adults with severe COVID-19 using data from a phase 3 remdesivir trial and a retrospective cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 treated with standard-of-care. METHODS: GS-US-540-5773 is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open-label trial comparing two courses of remdesivir (remdesivir-cohort). GS-US-540-5807 is an ongoing real-world, retrospective cohort study of clinical outcomes in patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (non-remdesivir-cohort). Inclusion criteria were similar between studies: patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were hospitalized, had oxygen saturation 94% or lower on room air or required supplemental oxygen, and had pulmonary infiltrates. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the treatment effect of remdesivir versus standard-of-care. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with recovery on day 14, dichotomized from a 7-point clinical status ordinal scale. A key secondary endpoint was mortality. RESULTS: After the inverse probability of treatment weighting procedure 312 and 818 patients were counted in the remdesivir- and non-remdesivir-cohorts, respectively. At day 14, 74.4% of patients in the remdesivir-cohort had recovered versus 59.0% in the non-remdesivir-cohort (adjusted odds ratio 2.03: 95% confidence interval 1.34-3.08, p<0.001).

Basal data were collected from 9 December to 9 March and follow-up data from 3 June to 10 July in 2020 for the lockdown group, and during the same timeframes in 2019 for the control groups. Changes in HbA1c (&#916;HbA1c) and body mass index (&#916;BMI) during lockdown were compared among patients with different psychological well-being, as evaluated by tertiles of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBS). RESULTS: No difference in &#916;HbA1c was found between the lockdown and control groups (lockdown group -0.1% [-0.5%-0.3%] vs. control group -0.1% [-0.4%-0.2%]; p = .482).

As this strategy significantly reduces the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD, PTCY has been thereafter considered not only in matched settings but also as sole GVHD prophylaxis, at least when considering myeloablative allotransplant using matched sibling (MSD) or unrelated (MUD) donors and bone marrow as source of graft. Here, PTCY, as a sole GVHD prophylaxis, was tested in a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) setting, using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as source of graft considering that this platform is currently broadly used worldwide in adults. Methods: This prospective monocentric phase 2 study was designed with the main objective to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of using only PTCY (without cyclosporine A nor mycophenolate mofetyl after transplant) in adults (18-70 years old) eligible for a RIC PBSC transplant with MSD or MUD. The Baltimore platform with 2 days of PTCY 50mg/kg/day on days 3 and 4 post infusion was considered as conditioning regimen, using fludarabine for lymphoid disease or clofarabine for myeloid disease. The primary objective was to appreciate the incidence of corticosteroid-resistant acute grade 3-4 GVHD (CR 3-4 GVHD) within 100 days post-transplant. According to statistical rules, patients have to be included in a step by step fashion (3, 3, 6, 15, 15 and 17 patients) for a total of 59 evaluable patients (meaning having received PTCY), in order to stop the protocol soon enough in case of excessive rate of deleterious severe acute GVHD (graded according to Mount Sinai International Consortium). Thus, the trial had to be stopped in case of documentation of > 2 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 3 patients, >3 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 6 patients, > 4 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 12 patients, > 6 3-4 CR GVHD for the first 27 patients, > 8 CR 3-4 GVHD for the first 42 patients and finally as soon as > 9 CR 3-4 GVHD for the last included patients. All patients gave informed consent. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03263767. Results: The results of the first 27 first patients (males n=17 and female n=10;median age: 59 years old (yo), range: 26-70) are reported here. They were included between February 2018 and November 2020. Diagnoses were AML (N=8), MDS (N=5), CMML (N=2), myelofibrosis (N=5), CML (N=1), DLBCL (N=1), T-cell lymphoma (N=1), Philadelphia positive B-ALL (N=1), CLL (N=1), lymphoblastic lymphoma (N=1) and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (N=1). Donors were MSD in 10 cases and MUD in 17. Only one primary graft failure was documented in a 61 yo MDS patient with active disease at transplant. He is however still alive in response after autologous reconstitution. With a median follow-up of 17.6 months (range: 10-42) for alive patients at the time of analysis (July 2021), 1-year and 2-year survivals were 80.9+7% and 74.7+9%, respectively, for both OS et DFS. GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1-year and 2-year was 58.7+9% and 52.2+10%, respectively. Three relapses (11%) and 6 deaths occurred. Deaths were due to acute GVHD in 4 patients (including 1 with sepsis and 1 with SARS-COVID 19 infection) and relapse in 2. Grade 2, 3 and 4 acute GVHD occurred in 11, 1 and 4 patients, respectively, for a total of 59% of grade 2-4 acute GVHD. CR 3-4 GVHD was observed in all of 5 patients with acute grade 3-4 GVHD and 4 died related to GVHD. Moderate/severe chronic GVHD occurred in 5/22 (22.7%) evaluable patients, including 4 still on immunosuppressive therapy at 40, 28, 25 and 16 months post-transplant. Overall non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 14.8% and related to acute GVHD. However, the number of cases conducting to stop the protocol was not reached. Conclusion: PTCY as a sole GVHD prophylaxis is here demonstrated as possible and relatively safe for adults receiving a matched PBSC Baltimore-based RIC allograft. The very good survivals reported he e may be related to a strong GVL effect associated with the high incidence of acute GVHD. However, because of this high incidence and the fact that NRM was related to GVHD after this first analysis, we have now made an amendment to test the addition to PTCY of one day of anti-thymoglobulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/kg on day-2 for the next 32 patients to be included.

However, the US has played a role as a net transmitter of volatility shocks during the entire period. Second, interdependence increased during the two crisis periods. Based on the total volatility spillover index, interdependence is stronger during the GFC than during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Here we show markedly reduced serum antibody titres against the Omicron variant (geometric mean titre (GMT) <10) as compared to wild-type virus 3-5 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 (GMT 218.8) or CoronaVac vaccines (GMT 32.5). A BNT162b2 booster dose elicited Omicron PRNT50 titres 25.6 in 88% of individuals (22 of 25) who previously received 2 doses of BNT162b2 and 80% of individuals (24 of 30) who previously received CoronaVac. However, few (3%) previously infected individuals (1 of 30) or those vaccinated with three doses of CoronaVac (1 of 30) met this threshold. Our findings suggest that countries primarily using CoronaVac vaccines should consider mRNA vaccine boosters in response to the spread of Omicron.

Many countries have implemented extensive control measures to prevent the entire migrant worker population from becoming infected. Here, we explore case count outcomes when utilizing lockdown and testing under different testing measures and transmissibility settings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model which estimates transmission across 10 different blocks with 1000 individuals per block under different parameter combinations and testing conditions over the period of 1 month. We vary parameters including differences in block connectivity, underlying recovered proportions at the time of intervention, case importation rates and testing protocols using either PCR or rapid antigen testing. RESULTS: We estimate that a relatively transmissible environment with fortnightly PCR testing at a relatively low initial recovered proportion of 40%, low connectivity where 10% of contacts occurred outside of the infected individuals block and a high importation rate of [Formula: see text] per day, results in an average of 39 (95%Interval: 9C121) new COVID-19 cases after one month of observation. Similar results were observed for weekly rapid antigen testing at 33 (9C95) cases. INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the need for either fortnightly PCR testing or weekly rapid antigen testing in high population density environments such as migrant worker dormitories.

PheWAS analysis was performed using genotype-phenotype data from the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP). Phenotypes were defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes mapped to clinically relevant groups using published PheWAS methods. Among 658,582 Veterans, variants associated with severe COVID-19 were tested for association across 1,559 phenotypes. Variants at the ABO locus (rs495828, rs505922) associated with the largest number of phenotypes (n(rs495828) = 53 and n(rs505922) = 59); strongest association with venous embolism, odds ratio (OR(rs495828) 1.33 (p = 1.32 x 10(?199)), and thrombosis OR(rs505922) 1.33, p = 2.2 x10(-265).

We report ECMO network organisation and outcomes during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we present an analysis of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe ARDS requiring ECMO who were admitted to 17 Greater Paris intensive care units between March 8 and June 3, 2020. Central regulation for ECMO indications and pooling of resources were organised for the Greater Paris intensive care units, with six mobile ECMO teams available for the region. Details of complications (including ECMO-related complications, renal replacement therapy, and pulmonary embolism), clinical outcomes, survival status at 90 days after ECMO initiation, and causes of death are reported. Multivariable analysis was used to identify pre-ECMO variables independently associated with 90-day survival after ECMO. FINDINGS: The 302 patients included who underwent ECMO had a median age of 52 years (IQR 45-58) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II of 40 (31-56), and 235 (78%) of whom were men. 165 (55%) were transferred after cannulation by a mobile ECMO team. Before ECMO, 285 (94%) patients were prone positioned, median driving pressure was 18 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (14-21), and median ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen was 61 mm Hg (IQR 54-70). During ECMO, 115 (43%) of 270 patients had a major bleeding event, 27 of whom had intracranial haemorrhage;130 (43%) of 301 patients received renal replacement therapy;and 53 (18%) of 294 had a pulmonary embolism. 138 (46%) patients were alive 90 days after ECMO. The most common causes of death were multiorgan failure (53 [18%] patients) and septic shock (47 [16%] patients). Shorter time between intubation and ECMO (odds ratio 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.99] per day decrease), younger age (2.89 [1.41-5.93] for &lt;=48 years and 2.01 [1.01-3.99] for 49-56 years vs &gt;=57 years), higher pre-ECMO renal component of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0.67, 0.55-0.83 per point increase), and treatment in centres managing at least 30 venovenous ECMO cases annually (2.98 [1.46-6.04]) were independently associated with improved 90-day survival. There was no significant difference in survival between patients who had mobile and on-site ECMO initiation. INTERPRETATION: Beyond associations with similar factors to those reported on ECMO for non-COVID-19 ARDS, 90-day survival among ECMO-assisted patients with COVID-19 was strongly associated with a centre's experience in venovenous ECMO during the previous year. Early ECMO management in centres with a high venovenous ECMO case volume should be advocated, by applying centralisation and regulation of ECMO indications, which should also help to prevent a shortage of resources.

Many oncology treatments are now calling on immunotherapy approaches, and scores of studies have investigated the role of p53 antibodies in cancer diagnosis and therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge from the preliminary evidence that suggests a potential role of p53 as an antigen in the adaptive immune response and as a key monitor of the innate immune system, thereby speculating on the idea that mutant p53 antigens serve as a druggable targets in immunotherapy. Except in a few cases, the vast majority of published work on p53 antibodies in cancer patients use wild-type p53 as the antigen to detect these antibodies and it is unclear whether they can recognize p53 mutants carried by cancer patients at all. We envision that an antibody targeting a specific mutant p53 will be effective therapeutically against a cancer carrying the exact same mutant p53. To corroborate such a possibility, a recent study showed that a T cell receptor-like (TCLR) antibody, initially made for a wild-type antigen, was capable of discriminating between mutant p53 and wild-type p53, specifically killing more cancer cells expressing mutant p53 than wild-type p53 in vitro and inhibiting the tumour growth of mice injected with mutant p53 cancer cells than mice with wild-type p53 cancer cells. Thus, novel antibodies targeting mutant p53, but not the wild-type isoform, should be pursued in preclinical and clinical studies.","output":"Mutant p53 as an Antigen in Cancer Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the early 1960s the analytical lens of polycentricity has provided an opportunity to understand complex systems and how they intersect in a variety of environments.

Their epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT images were reviewed. All 17 patients were aged between 12-83 years, with an average age of 47 years, and consisted of 10 males (58.8%) and 7 females (41.2%). Two patients had histories of living or traveling in Wuhan, and 9 patients were attacked locally. The 6 remaining patients were unknown about incidence reasons. RESULTS The average incubation period was 10 days, and the average time of the course of the disease was 9 days. Among the participants, 12 patients had fever as the first symptoms and 5 patients had normal body temperature. One patient was symptom-free carrier, and one patient had serious symptoms. One patient developed from mild symptoms to severe symptoms, and 14 patients had mild symptoms. Moreover, 7 patients had complications of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and hypertension, 1 patient was in the advanced stage of squamous cell lung carcinoma, and 1 patient had diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and late-stage uremia.

In addition CCSP promoter is commonly used to direct gene expression into the lung in transgenic models. The discovery of CCSP immunoreactivity in plasma membranes of airway lining cells prompted us to explore the possibility of enriching Clara cells by flow cytometry. We established a novel and simple method for the isolation of CCSP-expressing cell Clara cells using a combination of mechanical and enzymatic dissociation followed by flow cytometry sorting technology. We showed that 25% of dissociated cells from whole lung expressed CCSP. In the resulting preparation, up to 98% of cells expressed CCSP. Notably, we found that several common stem cell markers including CD44, CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 were expressed in CCSP(+) cells. Moreover, CCSP(+) cells were able to form spheroid colonies in vitro with 0.97 efficiency. Parallel studies in vivo confirmed that a small population of CCSP(?)expressing cells in mouse airways also demonstrates stem cell-like properties such as label retention and harboring rare bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in terminal bronchioles (TBs).

The virion particle is composed of seven proteins organized in three concentric layers, an outer layer made of VP2 and VP5, a middle layer made of VP7, and inner layer made of VP3 that encloses a replicase complex of VP1, VP4, and VP6 and a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments. In this study, we sought to develop highly efficacious candidate vaccines against all AHSV serotypes, taking into account not only immunogenic and safety properties but also virus productivity and stability parameters, which are essential criteria for vaccine candidates. To achieve this goal, we first established a highly efficient reverse genetics (RG) system for AHSV serotype 1 (AHSV1) and, subsequently, a VP6-defective AHSV1 strain in combination with in trans complementation of VP6. This was then used to generate defective particles of all nine serotypes, which required the exchange of two to five RNA segments to achieve equivalent titers of particles. All reassortant-defective viruses could be amplified and propagated to high titers in cells complemented with VP6 but were totally incompetent in any other cells. Furthermore, these replication-incompetent AHSV particles were demonstrated to be highly protective against homologous virulent virus challenges in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice. Thus, these defective viruses have the potential to be used for the development of safe and stable vaccine candidates. The RG system also provides a powerful tool for the study of the role of individual AHSV proteins in virus assembly, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE African horse sickness virus is transmitted by biting midges and causes African horse sickness in equids, with mortality reaching up to 95% in naive horses. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines is extremely important due to major economic losses in the equine industry. Through the establishment of a highly efficient RG system, replication-deficient viruses of all nine AHSV serotypes were generated. These defective viruses achieved high titers in a cell line complemented with VP6 but failed to propagate in wild-type mammalian or insect cells.

This article provides insights into: (1) the content and co-development of a participatory intervention combining two core elements: a complex health system taught course, and an adapted communications and emotional competence process training; and (2) the findings from a formative evaluation of this intervention which included observations of the training, individual interviews with participating managers and discussions in regular meetings with managers. Following the training, managers reported greater recognition of the importance of health system software (values, belief systems and relationships), and improved self-awareness and team communication. Managers appeared to build valued skills in active listening, giving constructive feedback, stepping back from automatic reactions to challenging emotional situations and taking responsibility to communicate with emotional competence. The training also created spaces for managers to share experiences, reflect upon and nurture social competences.

Herein we analyze the utility of the ROX index to predict the need and timing for IMV in a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with HFNT. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 129 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Secondary outcomes were mortality, rates of intubation, length of stay (LOS) and rates of nosocomial infections in our cohort treated with HFNT were also reported. Results 837 patients with COVID-19 were screened, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8(+13.6) years, BMI 32.6(+8), 58(45 %) were female, 72(55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Of the 129, 89 were HFNT only group whereas 40 in the HFNT progressed to IMV group. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days(+ 3.3). The 89 HFNT only patients had a significant improvement in ROX from initiation of HFNT at all recorded time points. In contrast, the ROX in HFNT progressed to IMV patients remained unchanged or decreased over time. ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p &lt;0.0001). In multivariate analysis, ROX (&lt;=0 versus &gt;0), peak D-dimer &gt;4000 and admission GFR &lt; 60 ml/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=0.001). Mortality was 11.2% in HFNT only group versus 47.5% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p = 0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SETTING Pediatric ICU in an academic tertiary care center, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. PATIENTS One hundred seven patients with non-cyanotic congenital heart defects between 6 weeks and 6 years of age. One hundred three patients underwent corrective surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS Prior to surgery patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups with specific RBC transfusion thresholds: Hb 10.8 g/dl (6.8 mmol/l) and Hb 8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l). MEASUREMENTS Length of stay in hospital (primary outcome), length of stay in PICU, duration of ventilation (secondary outcome), incidence of adverse events and complications related to randomization (intention to treat analysis). RESULTS In the restrictive transfusion group, mean volume of transfused RBC was 186 (70) ml per patient and in the liberal transfusion group 258 (87) ml per patient, (95% CI 40.6-104.6), p < 0.001. Length of hospital stay was shorter in patients with a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy: median 8 (IQR 7-11) vs. 9 (IQR 7-14) days, p = 0.047. All other outcome measures and incidence of adverse effects were equal in both RBC transfusion groups. Cost of blood products for the liberal transfusion group was 438.35 (203.39) vs. 316.27 (189.96) euros (95% CI 46.61-197.51) per patient in the restrictive transfusion group, p = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS For patients with a non-cyanotic congenital heart defect undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a restrictive RBC transfusion policy (threshold of Hb 8.0 g/dl) during the entire perioperative period is safe, leads to a shorter hospital stay and is less expensive.","output":"Safety and effects of two red blood cell transfusion strategies in pediatric cardiac surgery patients: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. The risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age. To identify gene products that may contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with the Gene Ontology (GO) term blood coagulation in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and identified four procoagulants, whose expression is higher in males and increases with age (ADAMTS13, F11, HGFAC, KLKB1), and two anticoagulants, whose expression is higher in females and decreases with age (C1QTNF1, SERPINA5). However, the expression of none of these genes was regulated in a proteomics dataset of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and none of the proteins have been identified as a binding partner of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Hence, they may rather generally predispose individuals to thrombosis without directly contributing to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In contrast, the expression of the procoagulant transferrin (not associated to the GO term blood coagulation) was higher in males, increased with age, and was upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

An exponential demand function was used to describe the proportion of participants accepting the vaccine at each efficacy. Linear mixed effect models evaluated development process and individual characteristic effects on minimum required vaccine efficacy required for vaccine acceptance. The rapid development process scenario increased the rate of decline in acceptance with reductions in efficacy. At 50% efficacy, 68.8% of respondents would seek the standard vaccine, and 58.8% would seek the rapid developed vaccine. Rapid vaccine development increased the minimum required efficacy for vaccine acceptance by over 9 percentage points, ?3 = 9.36, p < 0.001.

Current state-of-the-art cryoET combined with subtomogram averaging analysis enables the high-resolution structural determination of macromolecular complexes that are present in multiple copies within tomographic reconstructions. Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described.

We aimed to establish demographics and health profiles for the South African pilgrims performing the 2017 Hajj. Methods: This is a longitudinal survey-based study conducted on 1138 adult South African pilgrims in two phases (during and post-Hajj). Data on demographics, vaccination status, underlying health conditions, pre-Hajj training, health promotion, travel history, and health issues during and post-Hajj were collected using pre-designed questionnaires. Results: Participants had a mean age of 49.2 years (SD = 13.3; range 18C81), with a male: female ratio of 1.2:1. The majority of pilgrims were married (88.2%), of Indian/Asian background (73%), and literate (>99%). Nearly all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal disease and yellow fever, but only 23.7% were vaccinated against Influenza. Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol levels were the most common underlying health conditions reported by 22.6%, 13.2%, and 11.5% of pilgrims, respectively. One month after return to South Africa, nearly 65% of pilgrims reported illness during Hajj, while 40% reported falling ill post event upon return to South Africa. Nevertheless, only a few were admitted to hospitals (12 during Hajj and 15 post-Hajj). Among ill pilgrims, respiratory symptoms were the most commonly experienced symptoms during (70.2%) and post-Hajj (82.2%). Other symptoms such as walking-related symptoms include symptoms directly related or mainly caused by walking (e.g., leg pain, sore feet, blisters on the feet), dehydration, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms reported during Hajj. Medication to treat respiratory symptoms and antibiotics were the most commonly used medications during and post-Hajj. Having an underlying health condition was an independent predictor of falling ill during or post Hajj. Conclusion: Our study indicates that a sizable proportion of South African pilgrims are elderly with underlying health conditions and most contract respiratory tract infections during and post Hajj.

Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities; however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020.

A whole range of human activities has been suspended Monday 17 March 2020 in all French regions. Since then experiments are progressing to reflect the effectiveness of reduced emissions. In this paper, we looked at variations of pollutants prior to, during and after containment period. In a first step, we proved through experiments on eight air pollutants, how all daily maximum pollutants concentration have decreased during containment phase, apart from the ozone pollutant O3. This Ozone pollutant has indeed increased by 27.19% during lockdown period and kept growing by 21.35% as well right after deconfinement. Indeed, the maximum daily concentrations detected in different regions of France, have decreased by 18.18%, 37.14%, 20.36%, 9.28%, 44.38%, 5.1% and 44.38%, respectively, for the pollutants SO2, NO2, CO, C6H6, NOX, PM2.5 and PM10. Declining levels of other pollutants, however, were not sustained after deconfinement for NO2, NOX and PM10. We have reinforced these findings by classifying each pollutant according to the ATMO and AQI indexes, to better visualize their criticality throughout the three lockdown phases (Pre/During/Post). The family of air pollutant variables with their associated geographical sources was thereafter exploited to justify their approximate contribution to the daily mortality rates associated to COVID-19 across all French regions. However, more thorough study is still in progress to validate this finding. Finally, coming up to the abrupt changes in airborne pollutants experienced in this period, a question about future climate crisis was raised again. Whereby a weighting study has shown the current and very short-term French scenario (Status-Quo) in view of its current environmental path, the political responses made towards future climate change crisis and French investments done in this sense.","output":"Environmental impacts of pre/during and post-lockdown periods on prominent air pollutants in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea in 2015 started by a single imported case and was amplified by intra- and inter-hospital transmission. We describe two hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection in Daejeon caused by a single patient who was infected by the first Korean case of MERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical information involving MERS cases in the Daejeon cluster were retrospectively collected and potential contacts and exposures were assessed. The incubation periods and serial intervals were estimated. Viral RNAs were extracted from respiratory tract samples obtained from the index case, four secondary cases and one tertiary case from each hospital. The partial S2 domain of the MERS-CoV spike was sequenced. RESULTS: In Daejeon, a MERS patient (the index case) was hospitalized at Hospital A in the first week of illness and was transferred to Hospital B because of pneumonia progression in the second week of illness, where he received a bronchoscopic examination and nebulizer therapy. A total of 23 secondary cases (10 in Hospital A and 13 in Hospital B) were detected among patients and caregivers who stayed on the same ward with the index case. There were no secondary cases among healthcare workers. Among close hospital contacts, the secondary attack rate was 15.8% (12/76) in Hospital A and 14.3% (10/70) in Hospital B. However, considering the exposure duration, the incidence rate was higher in Hospital B (7.7/100 exposure-days) than Hospital A (3.4/100 exposure-days). In Hospital B, the median incubation period was shorter (4.6 days vs. 10.8 days), the median time to pneumonia development was faster (3 days vs. 6 days) and mortality was higher (70% vs. 30.8%) than in Hospital A. MERS-CoV isolates from 11 cases formed a single monophyletic clade, with the closest similarity to strains from Riyadh. CONCLUSION: Exposure to the MERS case in the late stage (2nd week) of diseases appeared to increase the risk of transmission and was associated with shorter incubation periods and rapid disease progression among those infected. Early detection and isolation of cases is critical in preventing the spread of MERS in the hospital and decreasing the disease severity among those infected.","output":"Outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Two Hospitals Initiated by a Single Patient in Daejeon, South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms for neurological complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are not yet well understood.

This rare situation of coexisting retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst (AC) and Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) have been previously reported in few cases (10 patients) with syringomyelia and hydrocephalus described to be the most relevant issues. The aim of this paper is to describe 3 pediatric cases of this condition with a systematic review of the literature, underlining the importance of surgical management tailored to the pathogenic mechanism. RESULTS: A case of a 10 months-old baby with coexisting AC and CM-1 with tri-ventricular hydrocephalus treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a case of 1 a year-old baby with a huge retrocerebellar AC and CM-1 treated with a cysto-peritoneal shunt and a case of a 15 years old with retrocerebellar AC causing symptomatic CM-1 treated with C0-C2 decompression, AC fenestration and duraplasty have been described. A long-term follow-up have been reported. CONCLUSION: Surgical management of coexisting ACs and CM-1 should not aim at the complete resolution of the cyst or of tonsils herniation, especially when pediatric patients are treated. Rather, the purpose of neurosurgeon should be to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanism and, then, restoring both the CSF flow in the posterior fossa and the dynamic equilibrium between ventricles, cyst and subarachnoid space.","output":"Coexisting Retrocerebellar Arachnoid Cyst and Chiari Type 1 Malformation: 3 Pediatric Cases of Surgical Management Tailored To The Pathogenic Mechanism and Systematic Review Of The Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To determine the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) in relation to age, gender, co-morbidities, ventilatory status, and length of stay (LOS). Methods This was a cross-sectional study based on data retrieved for 204 patients admitted to the ICU of Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan, from April to August 2020. Study variables were age, gender, co-morbid conditions, ventilatory status, and length of stay (LOS). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The independent t-test and the chi-square test were used to compare the means and frequencies of variables. Multivariate regression analysis was used to predict the likelihood of mortality. Results The overall mortality was 77%. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was administered to 61.8% of patients. Mortality was higher for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (93.6% vs 66.7%, p<0.001) and for over 60 years (87.3% vs 72.3%, p=0.019). Mortality without co-morbidities was 75.2%. Comparative mortality rates for at least one co-morbidity (79.7%), diabetes mellitus (80.0%), hypertension (100%), diabetes mellitus and hypertension both (87.1%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (75%) were insignificant. The LOS for survivors was longer (8.98.9 versus 5.45.2 days, p=0.017). The LOS < 24h was associated with higher mortality (85.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.040). On multivariable regression, the likelihood of mortality was high for IMV (7.330, 95% CI 2.667 - 20.143, p<0.001) and elderly (>60 years) patients (2.607, 95%CI 1.063 - 6.394, p=0.036). Mortality decreased with LOS longer than 24h (0.412, 95%CI 0.173 - 0.982, p=0.045). Co-morbidities did not have any effect on mortality. Conclusions Age more than 60 years and IMV were independent risk factors for higher mortality. Longer ICU stay, specifically more than 24 hours, was associated with lower mortality but LOS less than 24 hours might not have a causal relationship with mortality.

In this paper, using data from a diverse set of vantage points (one ISP, three IXPs, and one metropolitan educational network), we study the effect of these lockdowns on traffic shifts. We find that the traffic volume increased by 15-20% almost within a week--while overall still modest, this constitutes a large increase within this short time period. The Internet infrastruct ure is able to handle this increase, as most traffic shifts occur outside of traditional peak hours. When looking at traffic sources, we find that while hypergiants still contribute a significant fraction of traffic, we see a higher increase in traffic of non-hypergiants. We observe traffic increases in applications such as Web conferencing, VPN, gaming, messaging that people use when at home.

Parents reported a very high level of satisfaction (8.2/10) with previous face-to-face clinic appointments and virtual consultations (8.2/10). Individual aspects of virtual consultations received very positive ratings. Overall, 77% of parents highlighted a future preference for a combined service of both virtual and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high level of parental satisfaction with the service, but especially satisfaction with the unplanned transition to virtual clinics. Virtual clinics cannot replace the holistic approach gained from face-to-face consultations; however, we identified their benefits of convenience and accessibility for our vulnerable population. In response, we have developed an integrated outpatient service involving both forms of consultation to potentiate satisfaction and adapt to meet the needs of our patients.

Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age 90 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity.

While the search for an effective antiviral is still ongoing, experimental therapies based on repurposing of available antivirals is being attempted, of which HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have gained considerable interest. Inhibition profiling of the PIs directly against the viral protease has never been attempted in vitro, and while few studies reported an efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 context, the mechanism of action of the drugs remains to be validated. METHODS: We carried out an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of HIV PIs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) in cell culture and in vitro enzymatic assays, using a methodology that enabled us to focus solely on any potential inhibitory effects of the inhibitors against the viral protease. For cell culture experiments a dark-to-bright GFP reporter substrate system was designed. RESULTS: Lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, saquinavir, and atazanavir were able to inhibit the viral protease in cell culture, albeit in concentrations much higher than their achievable plasma levels, given their current drug formulations. While inhibition by lopinavir was attributed to its cytotoxicity, ritonavir was the most effective of the panel, with IC50 of 13.7 M. None of the inhibitors showed significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in our in vitro enzymatic assays up to 100 M concentration. CONCLUSION: Targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by some of the HIV PIs might be of limited clinical potential, given the high concentration of the drugs required to achieve significant inhibition. Therefore, given their weak inhibition of the viral protease, any potential beneficial effect of the PIs in COVID-19 context might perhaps be attributed to acting on other molecular target(s), rather than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Analysis of the efficacy of HIV protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2's main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused lasting damage to almost every domain in public health, society, and economy.

However, these solutions can barely provide precise prediction and satisfactory explanations on the long-term disease surveillance while the ubiquitous social media resources can be the key enabler for solving this problem. For example, serious discussions may occur on social media before and after some breaking events take place. These events, such as marathon and parade, may impact the spread of the virus.

However, even in the elderly population, the clinical course of infection in individual patients remains unpredictable. Hence, there is an urgent need for developing a simple tool predicting adverse COVID-19-outcomes. We assumed that the C2HEST-score could predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in the elderly subjects with COVID-19-subjects. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1047 medical records of patients at age > 65 years, hospitalized at the medical university center due to COVID-19. Subsequently, patients were divided into three categories depending on their C2HEST-score result. Results: We noticed significant differences in the in-hospital and 3-month and 6-month mortality-which was the highest in high-risk-C2HEST-stratum reaching 35.7%, 54.4%, and 65.9%, respectively. The medium-risk-stratum mortalities reached 24.1% 43.4%, and 57.6% and for low-risk-stratum 14.4%, 25.8%, and 39.2% respectively. In the C2HEST-score model, a change from the low to the medium category increased the probability of death intensity approximately two-times. Subsequently, transfer from the low-risk to the high-risk-stratum raised all-cause-death-intensity 2.7-times. Analysis of the secondary outcomes revealed that the C2HEST-score has predictive value for acute kidney injury, acute heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.

The current paper described how carnosine, a naturally occurring supplement, can be an effective drug candidate for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the basis of molecular docking and modeling to host ACE2 cocrystallized with nCoV spike protein. METHODS: First, the starting point was ACE2 inhibitors and their structure-activity relationship (SAR). Next, chemical similarity (or diversity) and PubMed searches made it possible to repurpose and assess approved or experimental drugs for COVID-19. Parallel, at all stages, the authors performed bioactivity scoring to assess potential repurposed inhibitors at ACE2. Finally, investigators performed molecular docking and modeling of the identified drug candidate to host ACE2 with nCoV spike protein. RESULTS: Carnosine emerged as the best-known drug candidate to match ACE2 inhibitor structure. Preliminary docking was more optimal to ACE2 than the known typical angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitor (enalapril) and quite comparable to known or presumed ACE2 inhibitors. Viral spike protein elements binding to ACE2 were retained in the best carnosine pose in SwissDock at 1.75 Angstroms. Out of the three main areas of attachment expected to the protein-protein structure, carnosine bound with higher affinity to two compared to the known ACE2 active site. LibDock score was 92.40 for site 3, 90.88 for site 1, and inside the active site 85.49. CONCLUSION: Carnosine has promising inhibitory interactions with host ACE2 and nCoV spike protein and hence could offer a potential mitigating effect against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Carnosine to Combat Novel Coronavirus (nCoV): Molecular Docking and Modeling to Cocrystallized Host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Viral Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES We studied the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of patients with chronic illnesses and their behavioural responses.

We aimed to identify patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke and explore markers of endotheliopathy, inflammation, and hypercoagulability. Background: Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is associated with a diverse array of neurologic complications, including ischemic stroke. Suspected mechanisms include hypercoagulability and endothelial injury, although evidence is sparse in stroke patients. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19 (n=21) compared to non-COVID-19 acute ischemic stroke patients (n=11). Timing of stroke onset during COVID-19 course, acute phase reactant levels, cytokine levels, endothelial activation, and hypercoagulability were evaluated with respect to stroke onset and etiology. Results: Twenty-one ischemic stroke patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Both groups had a similar age and burden of vascular risk factors. COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of endothelial activation around the time of stroke when compared to controls. The mean Factor VIII level was 332% of normal in the COVID-19 group and 49% in the control group, while von Willebrand Factor antigen and activity were 330% and 285% in the COVID-19 group and 213% and 152% in the control group, respectively. Cytokine storming and a strong inflammatory responses are defining features of severe COVID-19. We demonstrated a temporal correlation between stroke onset and the peak of acute phase reactants. Elevated cytokine levels, IL-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor levels in particular, were significantly associated with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) in COVID-19 patients when compared with other etiologies. Conclusions: We provide emerging evidence that endotheliopathy and the systemic inflammatory response in patients with vascular risk factors and COVID-19 is associated with ischemic stroke. Further research is needed. Understanding the mechanism of stroke in COVID- 19 patients will be critical in providing primary stroke prevention and treatment.","output":"Ischemic stroke, inflammation, and endotheliopathy in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children with pediatric inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, present with abdominal pain among other nonspecific symptoms. Although initial imaging features of PIMS-TS have been reported, the duration of sonographic features remains unknown. PURPOSE: To describe the abdominal US features of PIMS-TS at initial presentation and follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of children and young adults presenting with clinical features suspicious for PIMS-TS between April 2020 and June 2021 was carried out. US features were documented and reviewed at initial presentation and follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used and interobserver variability was calculated. RESULTS: Of 140 children and young adults presenting with suspected PIMS-TS, 120 had confirmed PIMS-TS (median age, 9 years; interquartile range, 7C12 years; 65 male patients) and 102 underwent abdominal US at presentation. PIMS-TS was present as a single abnormality in 109 of the 120 patients (91%) and abdominal symptoms were present in 104 of the 109 (95%). US examinations were abnormal in 86 of 102 patients (84%), with ascites being the most common abnormality in 65 (64%; 95% CI: 54, 73). Bowel wall thickening was present at US in 14 of the 102 patients (14%; 95% CI: 7, 20) and mesenteric inflammation was present in 16 (16%; 95% CI: 9, 23); all of these patients presented with abdominal symptoms. Among the patients with bowel wall thickening, the distal and terminal ileum were most involved (eight of 14 patients, 57%). Abdominal symptoms decreased to seven of 56 patients (13%) in those followed up at 6 months. Thirty-eight patients underwent follow-up US, and the presence of bowel inflammation had decreased to three of 27 patients (11%; 95% CI: C1, 23) in those followed up for less than 2 months and 0 of 17 (0%) in those followed up for more than 2 months. CONCLUSION: Of 102 patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent US at presentation, 14 (14%) had abdominal US findings of bowel inflammation and 16 (16%) had mesenteric edema.

Paclitaxel is a cytostatic substance used to treat breast cancer, but its therapeutically effective dose has many adverse effects. The aim of the presented study was to assess the anticancer effect of 6-gingerol and the possibility of increasing the effectiveness of Paclitaxel in the death induction of wild type human breast cancer cells. MCF-7/WT cells were treated with drugs6-gingerol and paclitaxel at selected concentrations. The mitochondrial activity assay, caspase 7 activity assay, ATP assay, microscopy studies, and RT-PCR assays were performed to evaluate the antitumor activity and mechanism of action of both compounds, alone and in combination. After 72 h of incubation, the mitochondrial activity showed that the combination of 5 nM Paclitaxel with 10 M 6-Gingerol led to the same decrease in viability as the use of 20 nM Paclitaxel alone; 10 M 6-Gingerol led to an enhancement of caspase 7 activity, with the highest activity observed after 24 h of incubation. A real-time PCR study showed that 6-Gingerol induces the simultaneous transcription of Bax with TP53 genes in large excess to BCL-2. In contrast, 5 nM Paclitaxel induces TP53 transcription in excess of BCL-2 and Bax.

This was a single-center study comprising 494 bacterial isolates (blood and urine) that were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the ICU and investigated in the Department of Microbiology of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India. Out of the total bacterial isolates, 55.46% were gram negative and 44.53% were gram positive pathogens. Of the blood samples processed, the most common isolates were CoNS (Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus. Amongst the urinary isolates, most common pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 60% MRSA was observed in urine and blood isolates. Up to 40% increase in AMR was observed amongst these isolates obtained during COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID-19 times. The overuse of antibiotics gave abundant opportunity for the bacterial pathogens to gradually develop mechanisms and to acquire resistance. Since the dynamics of SARS-COV-2 are unpredictable, a compromise on hospital antibiotic policy may ultimately escalate the burden of drug resistant pathogens in hospitals.

For all patients, history, clinical parameters, microbiological data, and lung ultrasound data were collected. Patients were stratified into three main groups (bacterial, viral, atypical) according to the presumed microbial etiology and LUS findings evaluated according to the etiological group. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from all patients. A qualitative diagnostic test developed by Nurex S.r.l. was used for identification of bacterial and fungal DNA in respiratory samples. The Seegene Allplex? Respiratory assays were used for the molecular diagnosis of viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, bacterial culture of blood and respiratory samples were performed, when indicated. RESULTS: A total of 186 children with suspected ALRTI (44% female) with an average age of 6 were enrolled in the study. We found that some ultrasound findings as size, number and distribution of consolidations, the position and motion of air bronchograms, pleural effusions and distribution of vertical artifacts significantly differ (p < 0.05) in children with bacterial, viral and atypical ALRTI.

Ultrasonographic images and additional information such as signalment and pleural fluid analysis, radiographic, bronchoscopic, and CT findings were collected. Surgical treatments and outcomes were also reviewed. RESULTS Transthoracic or transesophageal ultrasonography revealed grass awns in the pleural space (n = 13) or pulmonary parenchyma (10) of 23 dogs. Surgical removal of grass awns was successful on the first attempt in 21 of these 23 dogs (including 11/23 that had intraoperative ultrasonography performed to aid localization and removal of the awn). In the remaining 2 dogs, a second surgery was required. Twenty dogs with evidence of migrating intrathoracic grass awns had no foreign body identified on initial ultrasonographic evaluation and were treated medically; 16 developed draining fistulas, and awns identified ultrasonographically at follow-up visits were subsequently removed from the sublumbar region (n = 10) or thoracic wall (6). The remaining 4 dogs had no grass awn visualized. Clinical signs resolved in all dogs.

Methods: : We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of COVID-19 patients diagnosed from February 6 to March 1. The outcomes, including the occurrence of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), and endotracheal intubation (ETI), were recorded. The relationships of neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and NLR with outcomes were assessed using multivariate regression model. P -values for trends across quartiles of NLR was examined. Results: : A total of 182 patients were included. 37 (20.3%) patients died during the hospitalization, 41 (22.5%) developed AKI, and 36 (19.8%) received ETI. The NLR had a superior predictive performance than others. Using an NLR cutoff of 11.4, the area under the curves (AUC) were 0.766 for in-hospital mortality, 0.755 for AKI, and 0.733 for ETI. In multivariate analysis, NLR >11.4 was further identified as an independent prognostic factor. Following stratification with quartiles of NLR, a positive trend between the increasing quartiles of NLR and the three outcomes were observed ( p -values for trends across quartiles were 0.043, <0.001, and 0.041, respectively). The multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) in the highest quartile vs. the lowest quartile were 5.738 for mortality, 25.307 for AKI, and 5.136 for ETI.

We aimed to identify the prevalence, clinical impact, and predictors of early reocclusion after initially successful thrombectomies within a prospective cohort. Methods- A total of 711 stroke patients with successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, 2b/3) followed with magnetic resonance or computed tomographic angiography at 24 to 48 hours were included. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate associated factors and clinical impact. Results are displayed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI. Improvement in accuracy of additional imaging findings on angiography control runs after the intervention was evaluated by area under the curve. Results- Early reocclusion was observed in 16 of 711 successfully reperfused patients (2.3%; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3; median delay: 20 hours). Suggestive predictors were higher platelets on admission (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02), prestroke functional dependence (aOR, 7.12; 95% CI, 1.49-34.03), and stroke of undetermined or other specified pathogenesis in the TOAST classification (aOR, 7.19; 95% CI, 1.10-47.05 and aOR, 36.50; 95% CI, 4.47-298.11, respectively).

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on surgical resident education, instigating a major shift towards online webinar didactics as a major of resident teaching. We hypothesize that a case-based format of online didactics are the most preferred format for this style of lecture. STUDY DESIGN We analyzed viewer evaluations following 82 online hour-long lectures in the Urology Collaborative Online Video Didactics Lecture Series. We categorized each lecture as case-based, guidelines-based, practice updates, or surgical technique-based and assessed viewer responses to survey questions regarding subject area relevance, lecturer knowledgeability, lecturer effectiveness, and usefulness to learning. We performed logistic regression to control for viewer level, instructor level, and lecture topic, and using surgical technique-based lectures as the baseline variable. RESULTS 2176 evaluations were analyzed. Case-based, guidelines-based and practice updates were all scored significantly higher than surgical technique for subject area relevance. Case-based and guideline-based lectures scored significantly higher for usefulness to learning. Case-based lectures scored significantly higher for lecturer effectiveness. There was no significant difference in scoring between any lecture style when rated on lecturer knowledgeability. CONCLUSIONS When preparing online webinar based didactics for surgical resident education, case-based lecturers appear to be the most preferred and well received lecture style, followed closely by guidelines-based lectures.

Case Description A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the inter-atlanto-occipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries (VAs) were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata (MO). These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both the vertebral arteries were intact as well as the complete removal of the glass fragments. Conclusions CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurological damage but also secondary critical vascular damage.

People have lost their lives due to the virus and the lack of counter measures in place. Given the increasing caseload and uncertainty of spread, there is an urgent need to develop machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID-19. Prediction of the spread can allow counter measures and actions to be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, called Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and machine learning based Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM) to predict the spread of COVID-19. Our proposed models were trained and tested on novel coronavirus 2019 dataset, which contains 19.53 Million confirmed cases of COVID-19.

An etiologic diagnosis of superinfections can be difficult to obtain through the usual invasive procedures because of patient instability and the desire to avoid them because they may not be tolerated by the patient. Providers may also be hesitant to embark on such interventions in order to avoid healthcare personnel (HCP) exposure to aerosols. METHODS: Karius Test (KT) results are presented from 30 patients who presented with Covid-19. The KT is a CLIA certified/CAP-accredited next-generation sequencing (NGS) plasma test that detects pathogen cell free DNA (cfDNA). After cfDNA is extracted and NGS performed, human reads are removed and remaining sequences are aligned to a curated database of > 1400 organisms. Organisms present above a statistical threshold are reported. RESULTS: The KT detected pathogens in the majority of patients (n=20) with COVID-19. The most common infections were herpesviruses in 60% of patients. The most common bacterial pathogen was E. coli seen in 25% of patients. 15 out of 20 patients had more than one pathogen detected. 15% of patients had fungal pathogens, including one detection of Lichtheimia ramosa, in an immunocompromised patient. The results are summarized in the table.

The method used was a Mix Methods Research Approach, which is a combination of qualitative descriptive and quantitative exploratory approaches. There were 150 respondents for the three research locations at Palu City, Sigi Regency and Donggala Regency. Respondents were selected by considering the event conditions experienced, physical damage to their house and their educational background. Media sources of disaster information analyzed were TV, internet, mobile phone (WA/SMS), radio, mosque/church, surau, community leaders and word of mouth. The data used was Likert scale analyses for perception tested with Rank Spearman Correlation. The results showed that the most significant panic level (<0.01) was when the internet was not working, cellphones could not be used, and radio broadcasts could not be received. The most effective sources of disaster information in promoting a resilience attitude were guidance and advice from community leaders and ecological communication that was built from word of mouth. The exposure to natural disasters was shown to unite peoples hearts in friendship. despite some did not communicate with each other before the disaster, some were even hostile. As many as 78.6% of respondents admitted that the affection between them as victims actually appeared when natural disasters destroyed the joints of their lives, even amongst those who did not communicate with each other, or were even hostile, before the disaster.

METHODS Normocapnic hypoxia was induced in 40 male Landrace/Large White piglets. Reoxygenation was initiated when the animals developed bradycardia (HR <60 beats/min) or severe hypotension (MAP <15 mmHg). The animals were divided into four groups based on the oxygen (O(2)) concentration used for reoxygenation; groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received 18%, 21%, 40%, and 100% O(2), respectively. The animals were further classified into five groups based on the time required for reoxygenation: A: fast recovery (<15 min); B: medium recovery (15-45 min); C: slow recovery (45-90 min); D: very slow recovery (>90 min), and E: nine deceased piglets. RESULTS Histology revealed changes in all heart specimens. Interstitial edema, a wavy arrangement, hypereosinophilia and coagulative necrosis of cardiomyocytes were observed frequently. No differences in the incidence of changes were observed among groups 1-4, whereas marked differences regarding the frequency and the degree of changes were found among groups A-E. Coagulative necrosis was correlated with increased recovery time: this condition was detected post-asphyxia in 14%, 57%, and 100% of piglets with fast, medium, and slow or very slow recovery rates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The significant myocardial histological changes observed suggest that this experimental model might be a reliable model for investigating human neonatal cardiac hypoxia-related injury. No correlation was observed between the severity of histological changes and the fiO(2) used during reoxygenation. Severe myocardial changes correlated strictly with recovery time, suggesting an unreported individual susceptibility of myocardiocytes to hypoxia, possibly leading to death after the typical time-sequence of events.","output":"Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced myocardial lesions in newborn piglets are related to interindividual variability and not to oxygen concentration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute respiratory illnesses are the most common type of acute illness in the United States today.

As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58C78% of infected patients, and 22C44% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented.

This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally and between regions. Towards this we have devised a model of geographical spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells, in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different countries, Mexico, Finland and Iceland and found that the model is capable of reproducing and predicting the stochastic global path of the pandemic.

Lungs are one of the most commonly affected organ in RA, and the lung involvement in RA results in a various clinical features including interstitial lung disease (ILD) and organizing pneumonia (OP). OP is a histologic term characterized by the presence of buds of granulation tissue in bronchioles and alveoli. OP can be either idiopathic (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) or secondary to underlying disease such as infection, drugs or connective tissue disease including RA. Lung biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis, but the following criteria fulfilled by patients can lead to the diagnosis: (1) specific radiological manifestations (nonsegmental randomized consolidation with/without ground grass opacities in chest CT), (2) no causative infectious agent, (3) no response to antibiotics and (4) good response to corticosteroid therapy. We describe here the case of organized pneumonia discovered in a pregnant woman with known rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19 pandemic. Case description A 39-year old moroccan woman, gravida 4, para 1, was admitted during COVID-19 pandemic at 30 weeks' gestation to maternity hospital with a 1-week history of cough, dyspnea and fever. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and gestational diabetes. She was treated with 5mg of prednisolone daily for her RA. Blood sample showed white blood cell count and C reactive protein at a level of 6860/mm3 and 42mg/L respectively. Chest CT performed at her admission revealed diffuse irregular nodular condensations associated with ground glass infiltrates and a right lower lobe parenchymal condensation with airbronchogram in favor of superinfection. Given circumstances, she was tested twice for SARS-Cov-2 48 hours apart by PCR on nasopharyngeal sample and results came back negative. She was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and azithromycin during the first week and described an improvement in her clinical condition but symptoms reappeared 4 days after stopping treatment. During the 2 following months, until the delivery, the patient remained subpyretic with a nonproductive cough and moderate dyspnea. 5 days after the delivery, duesimilar image findings but some of the irregular nodular condensations showed a reversed halo sign and had a migrating character. Considering this typical image findings, the absence of causative infectious agents (excluded by bronchoalveaolar lavage performed after delivery) and the absence of response to antibiotics, we concluded with a diagnosis of OP secondary to RA without performing lung biopsy samples. A treatment with 48mg of methylprednisolone (and 100mg of azathioprine a few weeks later) was initiated. One month later, she showed a spectacular improvement in her clinical condition. A new chest CT highlighted disappearance of the majority of the ground glass areas and of all the condensations previously described. Methylprednisolone was then progressively tapered. Conclusion OP is a common pulmonary complication that can develop in RA. However, despite ou research, we have not found any other clinical case describing this disorder during pregnancy with RA. Since OP is a non-specific inflammatory response to an aggression of the organism, could we consider that the pregnancy is a state of aggression capable of causing such a response In addition, this clinical case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this pathology during the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Case-report: Organizing pneumonia in a pregnant woman with rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None.

Of all the HCPs, 53% and 33% respectively, reported BP increase in <20% and 20-40% of their patients on monotherapy while 14% of HCPs reported BP increase in >40% of their patients on monotherapy during the lockdown. As compared to high dose monotherapy, dual and triple combination therapies (TDC) were selected as most preferred for the management of uncontrolled BP opted by 56% and 34% of the HCPs, respectively. The dual combination antihypertensives were ranked as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) + diuretic (DU) > ARB + calcium channel blockers (CCB) > ARB + beta-blocker. The TDC with ARB + CCB + DU was the most favored TDC antihypertensive therapy during Covid-19 era. Acute coronary syndrome was anticipated as the most common complication of HTN in the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by renal dysfunction, cerebral ischemia and cerebral hemorrhage reported by 47%, 17%, 14% and 14% of HCPs, respectively. Multiple challenges in HTN care during Covid-19 as opined by HCPs included BP measurement while avoiding the risk of infection (57%), advising treatment via teleconsultation (48%), dose modification (41%), patient compliance (32%) and transport-related issues (30%). Most of the HCPs believed that self-monitoring of BP (32%) and economical medicines (24%) can improve medication adherence in patients with HTN. CONCLUSION: The study underlined that the provision of economic medicines, single pill combinations, doctor-patient digital connect, and patient education can help in improving medication adherence leading to better outcomes in patients with HTN during Covid-19. The study also suggested the need to enhance HBPM and the use of ARB-based dual and triple combination therapies to improve BP control in patients uncontrolled on monotherapy during Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"An indian clinician outlook on hypertension care during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Saporin, a type I ribosome-inactivating protein from soapwort plant, is a potent protein synthesis inhibitor Catalytically, saporin is a characteristic N-glycosidase, and it depurinates a specific adenine residue from a universally conserved loop of the major ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of eukaryotic cells It is well-known that saporin induces apoptosis through different pathways, including ribotoxic stress response, cell signal transduction, genomic DNA fragmentation and RNA abasic lyase (RAlyase) activity, and NAD(+) depletion by poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase hyperactivation Saporin's high enzymatic activity, high stability, and resistance to conjugation procedures make it a well-suited tool for immunotherapy approaches In the present study, we focus on saporin-based targeted toxins that may be efficacious therapeutic agents for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection Our discussed points suggest that saporin may be a strategic molecule for therapeutic knockout treatments and a powerful candidate for novel drugs in the struggle against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)","output":"Saporin, a Polynucleotide-Adenosine Nucleosidase, May Be an Efficacious Therapeutic Agent for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal and human endemic coronaviruses have been known for decades, as has their capacity to re-infect In the COVID-19 pandemic, it is key to reveal the factors that influence reinfection susceptibility In this commentary, I provide a view on endemic animal and human coronaviruses and the correlates of protection to reinfection","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Re-infections: Lessons from Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals C not just on the number of confirmed cases. In order to estimate the IFR, several seroprevalence studies have been or are currently conducted. METHODS: Using German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections. RESULTS: Effective IFRs in Germany are estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while an increasing gap can be observed during the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: The development of estimated effective IFR and observed CFR reflects the changing age distribution of infections over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Further research is warranted to obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates, particularly in light of new variants of the virus.","output":"Estimating effective infection fatality rates during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article on p. 280 in vol. 10, PMID: 34485577.].","output":"Erratum: An overview of 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic: A review study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publisher Summary Medicines might largely be avoided if enough evidence of quality, safety, and efficacy are not provided by the manufacturer prior to their introduction.

Methods: We conducted a scoping review of literature published January 2020 - February 2021 and focused on the topic of QI at public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search was conducted on four bibliographic databases, in addition to a supplementary grey literature search using custom Google search engines and targeted website search methods. Of the 1,878 peer-reviewed articles assessed, 15 records met the inclusion criteria. An additional 11 relevant records were identified during the grey literature search, for a total of 26 records included in the scoping review.

Conclusions: The literature indicates that QI-oriented activities are occurring at the organizational and program levels to enhance COVID-19 response. To optimize the benefits that QI approaches and methodologies may offer, it is important for public health agencies to focus on both widespread integration of QI as part of an organization's management philosophy and culture, as well as project level activities at all stages of the emergency management cycle.","output":"Rising Through the Pandemic: A scoping review of quality improvement in public health during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiologists play a key role in multidisciplinary care by guiding heart failure (HF) management in the hospital and in the community. Regional implementation of multidisciplinary health care interventions depends on how they perceive collaboration with other health care disciplines, yet research on this topic is limited. This study aimed to explore the views and opinions of cardiologists on multidisciplinary collaboration in HF care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study based on face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 11 Belgian cardiologists between September 2019 and February 2020. We used the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) method as guidance for data analysis until data saturation was reached. RESULTS: Cardiologists consider the general practitioner (GP) and HF nurse as the most important partners in HF management. Cardiologists identified four problems in current multidisciplinary collaboration: the communication of a HF diagnosis to the patient, advanced care planning, titration of HF medication by the GP and electronic data exchange and communication. Three themes emerged as ideas for improvement of HF care: 1) expansion of the role of the HF nurse, 2) implementation of a structured, patient-centered, and flexible model of disease management program and 3) integrated data approaches. CONCLUSION: Cardiologists value close cooperation with GPs in HF management. They advocate an expanded future role for the HF nurse, increased eHealth, and structured disease management to optimize current HF care.

Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides bind their receptors in T cells, and induce multiple beneficial T cell functions. Yet, T cells of different people vary in the expression levels of Neurotransmitter and Neuropeptide receptors, and in the magnitude of the corresponding effects. Therefore, we performed an individual-based study on T cells of 3 healthy subjects, and 3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC usually develops due to chronic inflammation. The inflamed liver induces reduction and inhibition of CD4+ T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Immune-based therapies for HCC are urgently needed. We tested if selected Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides decrease the key checkpoint protein PD-1 in human T cells, and increase proliferation and killing of HCC cells. First, we confirmed human T cells express all dopamine receptors (DRs), and glutamate receptors (GluRs): AMPA-GluR3, NMDA-R and mGluR. Second, we discovered that either Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and/or CGRP (10nM), as well as DR and GluR agonists, induced the following effects: 1. Decreased significantly both %PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression level per cell (up to 60% decrease, within 1 h only); 2. Increased significantly the number of T cells that proliferated in the presence of HCC cells (up to 7 fold increase), 3. Increased significantly T cell killing of HCC cells (up to 2 fold increase). 4. Few non-conventional combinations of Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides had surprising synergistic beneficial effects. We conclude that Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and CGRP, alone or in combinations, can decrease % PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression per cell, in T cells of both healthy subjects and HCC patients, and increase their proliferation in response to HCC cells and killing of HCC cells.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in dietary intake patterns and their impacts on the weight status of young adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 1045 young adults in Malaysia. The changes in dietary intake patterns were assessed using the Dietary Diversity Questionnaire with slight modifications, while anthropometric measurements including body height, body weight before the pandemic and current body weight were self-reported. Results: Overall, nearly half of the respondents (48.8%) gained weight during the confinement, with an average increment of 4.06  3.23 kg. Of 1045, 45.3% reported consuming more fruits and 60.2% had higher plain water intake during the pandemic. It is observed that 41.0% to 66.8% of the young adults changed their dietary intake patterns during the pandemic. Increased consumption in cereals and grains ( = 0.084, p = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.017C0.160), as well as oils and fats ( = 0.123, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.059C0.241), was positively associated with weight gain during the pandemic. On the contrary, an increased plain water intake was negatively associated with weight gain during the lockdown ( = ?0.100, p = 0.003, 95% CI = ?0.171C?0.034). Findings in the current study also suggested that cutting back cereals and grains ( = 0.156, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.122C0.288), as well as oils and fats ( = 0.091, p = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.022C0.183), contributed significantly to weight loss during the pandemic confinement. Conclusion: In conclusion, the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) drove up the prevalence of overweight/obesity among young adults in Malaysia. Increased consumption of cereals and grains and oils and fats contributed to weight gain in the pandemic lockdown. Nonetheless, a noticeable proportion of young adults in Malaysia shifted to a healthier food choice by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables.","output":"Changes in Dietary Intake Patterns and Weight Status during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study Focusing on Young Adults in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires treatments with rapid clinical translatability.

Although there is a high rate of spontaneous recovery within the first two years of life, it remains challenging to determine which patients will benefit most from surgical intervention. The diagnostic and predictive use of various imaging modalities has been described in the literature, but there is little consensus on approach or algorithm. The anatomic, pathophysiological, and neurodevelopmental characteristics of the neonatal and infant patient population affected by PBPP necessitate thoughtful consideration prior to selecting an imaging modality. METHODS A systematic review was conducted using six databases. Two reviewers independently screened articles published through October 2021. RESULTS Literature search produced 10,329 publications, and 22 articles were included in the final analysis. These studies included 479 patients. Mean age at time of imaging ranged from 2.1 to 12.8 months and investigated imaging modalities included MRI (18 studies), ultrasound (4 studies), CT myelography (4 studies), and X-ray myelography (1 study). Imaging outcomes were compared against surgical findings (16 studies) or clinical examination (6 studies), and 87.5% of patients underwent surgery. CONCLUSION This systematic review addresses the relative strengths and challenges of common radiologic imaging options. MRI is the most sensitive and specific for identifying preganglionic nerve injuries such as pseudomeningoceles and rootlet avulsion, the latter of which has the poorest prognosis in this patient population and often dictates the need for surgical intervention.","output":"Radiographic imaging modalities for perinatal brachial plexus palsy: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a common and robust tool for accurate quantification of mRNA transcripts.

An online survey measuring fear of COVID-19, IU, emotional regulation, and psychological distress was administered to 3863 Italian adults (females 73.3%; M(age) = 36.44; SD = 14.74) during lockdown. Results showed that IU partially mediated the effect of fear of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress.

In this study, firstly using System Dynamics (SD) model, the behavior of countries against COVID-19 for a certain period of time is observed, subsequently the increase in complexity is analyzed with entropy measurement to determine whether the systems are resilient or not and to mark the differences arising from reporting in the first and second wave of the pandemic in the developed model. It is determined that the second wave reporting differences is less than first wave reporting differences except Turkey. From the learning effect perspective, it has been seen that the effect on the economy and foreign trade are less than first wave of pandemic even though the number of patients originating in the second wave are higher.

Methods We used population-level questionnaire data from a social networking service (SNS) with 275,560 respondents from March 5 to April 6 to evaluate the relationship between telework implementation and the presence of a fever (body temperature above 37.5C) within one month as a surrogate indicator of COVID-19 infection, by occupation type and age group. Results Among company employees, a statistical significance was identified in the 15C29 and 30C59 age groups, showing higher fever rates in the non-teleworker group (for 15C29 age group, non-teleworkers: 7.64%; teleworkers: 6.45%; p=0.02; for 30C59 age group, non-teleworkers: 3.46%; teleworkers: 3.14%; p=0.02). Conclusions Telework remains a controversial topic in Japan as the government called for emergency measures. While caution is warranted in interpreting our findings because our data is limited to the voluntary SNS users, they will be essential to push forward with more measures to promote social distancing measures in the midst of Japan's current tense political climate.","output":"The relationship between fever rate and telework implementation as a social distancing measure against the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to associate lifestyle characteristics with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates at the U.S. county level and sequentially map the impact of COVID-19 on different lifestyle segments. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical testing to determine whether there is any correlation between COVID-19 infection and mortality rates and lifestyles. We used ESRI Tapestry LifeModes data that are collected at the U.S. household level through geodemographic segmentation typically used for marketing purposes to identify consumers' lifestyles and preferences. According to the ANOVA analysis, a significant association between COVID-19 deaths and LifeModes emerged on 1 April 2020 and was sustained until 30 June 2020. Analysis of means (ANOM) was also performed to determine which LifeModes have incidence rates that are significantly above/below the overall mean incidence rate. We sequentially mapped and graphically illustrated when and where each LifeMode had above/below average risk for COVID-19 infection/death on specific dates. A strong northwest-to-south and northeast-to-south gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the United States into several epidemic subregions based on household lifestyle characteristics. Our approach correlating lifestyle characteristics to COVID-19 infection and mortality rate at the U.S. county level provided unique insights into where and when COVID-19 impacted different households. The results suggest that prevention and control policies can be implemented to those specific households exhibiting spatial and temporal pattern of high risk.","output":"Lifestyle Effects on the Risk of Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States: Evaluation of Market Segmentation Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With immediate effect, new articles in this journal will be published Open Access with no publication charges.

However, manufacturers often provide diagnostic accuracy data generated through biased studies and the performance in clinical practice is essentially unclear. Objectives: We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various serological testing strategies for (a) identification of patients with previous coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and (b) prediction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in real-life clinical settings. Methods: : We prospectively included 2573 consecutive health-care workers and 1085 inpatients with suspected or possible previous COVID-19 at a Swiss University Hospital. Various serological immunoassays based on different analytical techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA;chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA;electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, ECLIA;lateral-flow immunoassay, LFI), epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid, N;receptor-binding domain, RBD;extended RBD, RBD+;S1 or S2 domain of the spike [S] protein, S1/S2), and antibody subtypes (IgG, pan-Ig) were conducted. A positive real-time PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab was defined as previous COVID-19. Neutralization assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a subgroup of patients to assess neutralization activity (n=201). Results: : The sensitivity to detect patients with previous COVID-19 was 85% in anti-N ECLIA (86.8%) and anti-S1 ELISA (86.2%). Sensitivity was 84.7% in anti-S1/S2 CLIA, 84.0% in anti-RBD+ LFI, 81.0% in anti-N CLIA, 79.2% in anti-RBD ELISA, and 65.6% in anti-N ELISA. The specificity was 98.4% in anti-N ECLIA, 98.3% in anti-N CLIA, 98.2% in anti-S1 ELISA, 97.7% in anti-N ELISA, 97.6% in anti-S1/S2 CLIA, 97.2% in anti-RBD ELISA, and 96.1% in anti-RBD+ LFI. The sensitivity to detect neutralizing antibodies was 85% in anti-S1 ELISA (92.7%), anti-N ECLIA (91.7%), anti-S1/S2 CLIA (90.3%), anti-RBD+ LFI (87.9%), and anti-RBD ELISA (85.8%). Sensitivity was 84.1% in anti-N CLIA, and 66.2% in anti-N ELISA. The specificity was 97% in anti-N CLIA (100%), anti-S1/S2 CLIA (97.7%), and anti-RBD+ LFI (97.9%). Specificity was 95.9% in anti-RBD ELISA, 93.0% in anti-N ECLIA, 92% in anti-S1 ELISA, and 65.3% in anti-N ELISA. Diagnostic accuracy measures were consistent among subgroups. Conclusions: : The diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied remarkably in clinical practice, and the sensitivity to identify patients with previous COVID-19 deviated substantially from the manufacturers specifications. The data presented here should be considered when using such tests to estimate the infection burden within a specific population and determine the likelihood of protection against re-infection.","output":"Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical practice: a comparative diagnostic accuracy study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak in China has been gradually controlled.

Currently, research on the spread risk from asymptomatic cases was limited, and lacking the data relates to the distribution of asymptomatic cases in large community population. Pathogen detection using PCR is suitable for screening in close contacts of confirmed cases and should be started as early as possible.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measuresincluding novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancingmight be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. METHODS: For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40 162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. RESULTS: We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15 000C41 000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

Screening is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment, which reduces morbidity and mortality across all three illnesses. We evaluated testing uptake for HIV, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis in Kisumu, Kenya. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from adults aged 18C35 years who enrolled in a prospective HIV incidence cohort study from February 2017 to May 2018 were analyzed. A questionnaire was administered to each participant at screening for study eligibility to collect behavioral characteristics and to assess prior testing practices. Among participants without a history of previously-diagnosed HIV, multivariable robust Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors potentially associated with HIV testing in the 12 months prior to enrollment. A hierarchical model was used to test for differential access to testing due to spatial location. RESULTS: Of 671 participants, 52 (7.7%) were living with HIV, 308 (45.9%) were female, and the median age was 24 (interquartile range 21C28) years. Among 651 (97.0%) who had ever been tested for HIV, 400 (61.2%) reported HIV testing in the past 6 months, 129 (19.7%) in the past 6C12 months, and 125 (19.1%) more than one year prior to enrollment. Any prior testing for viral hepatitis was reported by 8 (1.2%) participants and for tuberculosis by 51 (7.6%). In unadjusted models, HIV testing in the past year was more common among females (PR 1.08 [95% CI 1.01, 1.17]) and participants with secondary education or higher (PR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02, 1.19]). In the multivariable model, only secondary education or higher was associated with recent HIV testing (adjusted PR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02, 1.20]). Hierarchical models showed no geographic differences in HIV testing across Kisumu subcounties. CONCLUSIONS: Prior HIV testing was common among study participants and most had been tested within the past year but testing for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis was far less common. HIV testing gaps exist for males and those with lower levels of education.

We identified a core innate gene signature emerging 1 day after the second vaccination and that was shared by the recipients of vaccines formulated with adjuvant systems AS01B, AS01E, or AS03. This core signature associated with the magnitude of the hepatitis B surface-specific antibody response and was characterized by positive regulation of genes associated with interferon-related responses or the innate cell compartment and by negative regulation of natural killer cell-associated genes. Analysis at the individual subject level revealed that the higher immunogenicity of AS01B-adjuvanted vaccine was linked to its ability to induce this signature in most vaccinees even after the first vaccination. Therefore, our data suggest that adjuvanticity is not strictly defined by the nature of the receptors or signaling pathways it activates but by the ability of the adjuvant to consistently induce a core inflammatory signature across individuals.","output":"Transcriptional profiles of adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines display variable interindividual homogeneity but a shared core signature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guidance from many health authorities recommend that social distancing measures should be implemented in an epidemic when community transmission has already occurred.

METHODS: A total of 26 households with 39 family clusters between January, 2020 and February, 2021 in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. The Becker's chain binomial model was used to analyze the probabilities of being infected and escaping from SARS-COV-2 before and after January 1st, 2021, which were further converted to estimating basic reproductive numbers in the absence of NPIs. The likelihood of leading to the subsequent community-acquired outbreak given NPIs was further assessed. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate was 46.2%. Given the saturated Greenwood model selected as the best fitted model, the probability of being infected and escaping from COVID-19 within household was estimated as 44.4% (95% CI: 5.0%-53.7%) and 55.7% (95% CI: 46.3%-65.0%), respectively. In the second period of early 2021, the infected probability was increased to 58.3% (95% CI: 12.7%-90.0%) and the escape probability was lowered to 41.7% (95% CI: 0.0%-86.9%). The corresponding basic reproductive numbers (R0) increased from 4.29 in the first period to 6.73 in the second period without NPIs.

METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, we retrieved individual data from in-patients treated March 1 to April 15, 2020 from COVID-19 registries of three hospitals in Saxony, Germany. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA recommendations using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases and bibliographies of identified papers (last search on April 11, 2020) and pooled data with those deriving from our multicenter study. Of 3762 records identified, 11 eligible observational studies of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in quantitative data synthesis. Risk ratios (RR) of severe COVID-19 according to history of CVD were pooled using DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrans Q and I2-statistics. Severity of COVID-19 according to definitions applied in included studies was the main outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for clusters of studies with equal definitions of severity. RESULTS: Pooled analysis included data from 1906 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (43.9% females, median age ranging from 39 to 76 years). Patients with previous CVD had higher risk of severe COVID-19 than those without [RR 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52C2.81; p < 0.0001]. This association was also observed in clusters of studies that defined severe manifestation of the disease by clinical parameters (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22C1.71; p < 0.0001), necessity of intensive care (RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.83C4.24; p < 0.0001) and in-hospital death (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.75C2.7; p < 0.0001).

This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study examining how lockdown measures impacted upon the lives of nurses, midwives and personal care assistants caring for community-based patients during this time. The study involved nationwide surveys and in-depth interviews with 15 registered nurses employed in community settings, two community midwives and five personal care assistants. During the lockdown, nurses, midwives and personal care assistants working in the community showed considerable courage in answering their 'call to duty' by taking on heightened care responsibilities and going 'the extra mile' to help others. They faced significant risks to personal and professional relationships when they were required to take on additional and complex responsibilities for community-based patients. Despite the hypervigilant monitoring of their personal protective equipment (PPE), the need to safeguard family and community members generated considerable stress and anxiety.

Moreover, the negative impacts of experiences during lockdown often continued to be felt once restrictions had been lifted, inflecting life during periods in which community transmission of COVID-19 was not occurring. This article makes five core service delivery and policy recommendations for supporting community-based nurses, midwives and personal care assistants in respiratory disease pandemics: acknowledging the crucial role played by community-based carers and the associated stress and anxiety they endured by championing respect and compassion; demystifying the 'heroism' or 'self-sacrifice' projected onto care workers; the timely provision of adequate protective equipment; improving remuneration, with adequate provision for time off; and regular counselling, peer support groups and education on work-life balance delivered by support workers in recognition of stressors arising from these complex and isolated working conditions.","output":"Community healthcare workers' experiences during and after COVID-19 lockdown: A qualitative study from Aotearoa New Zealand."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Were southern hemisphere countries right to undertake national lockdown during their summer time?

This complexity is apparent from the different forms in which AF presents itself (post-operative, paroxysmal and persistent), each with heterogeneous patterns and variable progression. Our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for initiation, maintenance and progression of the different forms of AF has increased significantly in recent years. Nevertheless, antiarrhythmic drugs for the management of AF have not been developed based on the underlying arrhythmia mechanisms and none of the currently used drugs were specifically developed to target AF. With the increased knowledge on the mechanisms underlying different forms of AF, new opportunities for developing more effective and safer AF therapies are emerging. In this review, we provide an overview of potential novel antiarrhythmic approaches based on the underlying mechanisms of AF, focusing both on the development of novel antiarrhythmic agents and on the possibility of repurposing already marketed drugs. In addition, we discuss the opportunity of targeting some of the key players involved in the underlying AF mechanisms, such as ryanodine receptor type-2 (RyR2) channels and atrial-selective K+-currents (IK2P and ISK) for antiarrhythmic therapy. In addition, we highlight the opportunities for targeting components of inflammatory signaling (e.g., the NLRP3-inflammasome) and upstream mechanisms targeting fibroblast function to prevent structural remodeling and progression of AF. Finally, we critically appraise emerging antiarrhythmic drug principles and future directions for antiarrhythmic drug development, as well as their potential for improving AF management.","output":"Emerging Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Atrial Fibrillation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: There are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable to severe sequelae of COVID-19. Objective: To examine whether the UK's lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19. Designs, Setting, Participants: UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22. Exposures: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown (self-reported). Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks in narratives on coping. Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk. Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.","output":"Behavioural change towards reduced intensity physical activity is disproportionately prevalent among adults with serious health issues or self-perception of high risk during the UK COVID-19 lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on populations worldwide, leading to significant restrictions on athletic population Consequently, athletes routines, namely training sessions have changed and competitions were mainly postponed, which have negatively affected daily eating behaviours, including supplementation Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the consumption of dietary supplements (DS) by Portuguese athletes during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Methods: Eighty-nine Portuguese athletes (22 13 2years old) of high performance level (16 76 3hours/week) volunteered to complete a questionnaire regarding the use of DS during the time of COVID-19 An adaptation of a Portuguese validated questionnaire was used to assess DS intakes and sources of supplement information in addition to socio-demographic and training data The significance level was 5% (P&lt;0 05) Results: The three major reasons for using DS were improving sports performance (46 2%), accelerating recovery (32 6%) and staying healthy (29 7%) The mean number of DS used per athlete was 3 82 4, ranging from 0 to 10 A total of 309 products were consumed from which 73 0% were the nine most used The most popular DS was sport drink (72 3%), followed by multivitamins (68 6%), protein (68 2%) and creatine (65 1%) In the athlete-gender analysis, significant differences were observed for all DS (P&lt;0 05) The most used by female athletes was sport drink (23 0%), which was also most used by males in higher amounts (68 6%) When the source of information was the nutritionist, the use of sport drink and protein was more prevalent Although the majority of DS users (62 8%) was sufficiently informed about the use of DS, more than one third of users were not (31 9%) Conclusion: Athletes need appropriate guidance for the correct use of DS in order to promote a healthy training regime and to insure an adequate recovery, especially during this pandemic time References: None Disclosure of Interest: None declared","output":"Dietary supplements used by athletes during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is one of the leading causes of cancer death.

Since the general practice in commercial buildings is to use low-efficiency air filters and given that indoor air is generally recycled, the degree to which cross-zone aerosol transmission occurs is of interest. To quantify the cross-zone aerosol transmission, experiments were conducted using a synthetic test aerosol in the five zones on the first floor of a model commercial office building at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Because the synthetic aerosol was tagged with fluorescent salt, the aerosol generated from the source zone can be distinguished from the background aerosols due to its unique fluorescent signal. Data from cross-zone campaigns showed that submicron-aerosol transmission was higher than the micron aerosols. In campaigns with doors closed, the submicron aerosol transmission was less than 16% and less than 11% for micron aerosol transmission. Opening the interior doors that connecting different zones can significantly enhance the aerosol transmission for zones at the close proximity to the source, but has less impact on those farther away.","output":"Characterization of the indoor far-field aerosol transmission in a model commercial office building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As an emerging infectious disease, COVID-19 has garnered great research interest We aimed to explore the differences between English language and Chinese language Medical/Scientific journals publications, particularly aiming to explore the efficacy/contents of the literature published in English and Chinese in relation to the outcomes of management and characterization of COVID-19 during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic Methods: Publications on COVID-19 research were retrieved from both English and Chinese databases Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer 1 6 14, and CiteSpace V software Network maps were generated to evaluate the collaborations between different authors, countries/provinces, and institutions Results: A total of 143 English and 721 Chinese original research articles and reviews on COVID-19 were included in our study Most of the authors and institutions of the papers were from China before March 1st, 2020, however, the distribution of authors and institutions were mainly in developed countries or more wealthy areas of China The range of the keywords in English publications was more extensive than those in Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine was seen more frequently in Chinese papers than in English Of the 143 articles published in English, 54 articles were published by Chinese authors only and 21 articles were published jointly by Chinese and other overseas authors Conclusions: The publications in English have enabled medical practitioners and scientists to share/exchange information, while on the other hand, the publications in the Chinese language have provided complementary educational approaches for the local medical practitioners to understand the essential and key information to manage COVID-19 in the relatively remote regions of China, for the general population with a general level of education","output":"Bibliometric Analysis on COVID-19: A Comparison of Research Between English and Chinese Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs provide evidence-based services for young people with a recent onset of a psychotic disorder.

The study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on medical students psychological well-being in Pakistan. Following ethical approval, an online survey developed in collaboration with World Psychiatric Association (WPA) was distributed among medical students of 5 Medical colleges in the Punjab province of Pakistan between August and September 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale (RASS) were used to assess psychological well-being. Data was analyzed using SPSS 26.0. RESULTS: Eleven hundred medical students responded, 756 (69%) being females. More than 2/3rd admitted that their emotional state got worse in relation to appearance of anxiety, insecurity, and sadness, compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 48.6% and 48.1%, respectively. Female medical students, pre-clinical students, and those with a previous psychiatric history reported experiencing more anxiety and depression symptoms (P value < 0.001). One in five medical students thought that it would be better if they were dead, and 8% admitted to often think of committing suicide during the past 2 weeks. RASS and subscales (intention, life, and history) scores were higher in females and students with previous psychiatric problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore that the impact of COVID-19 on medical students has been significant; hence, it is crucial for medical colleges to employ strategies to maintain the students well-being with safeguards like reassurance, support, and confidential student-centered psychiatric services. The use of virtual platforms (websites, email) to educate and screen students by staff members can create a positive impact.

Various determinants of disease progression such as age, sex, virus mutations, comorbidity, lifestyle, host immune response, and genetic background variation have caused clinical variability of COVID-19. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an enveloped coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that invades host cells using an endocytic pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the main viral protein that contributes to the fusion of the virus particle to the host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The highly conserved expression of ACE2 is found in various animals, which indicates its pivotal physiological function. The ACE2 has a crucial role in vascular, renal, and myocardial physiology. Genetic factors contributing to the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown; however, variants in the specific sites of ACE2 gene could be regarded as a main genetic risk factor for COVID-19. Given that ACE2 is the main site for virus landing on host cells, the effect of amino acid sequences of ACE2 on host susceptibility to COVID-19 seems reasonable. It would likely have a substantial role in the occurrence of a wide range of clinical symptoms. Several ACE2 variants can affect the protein stability, influencing the interaction between spike protein and ACE2 through imposing conformational changes while some other variants are known to cause a decrease or an increase in the ligand-receptor affinity. The other variations are located at the proteolytic cleavage site, which can influence virus infection; because soluble ACE2 can act as a decoy receptor for virus and decrease virus intake by cell surface ACE2. Notably, polymorphisms of regulatory and non-coding regions such as promoter in ACE2, can play crucial role in different expression levels of ACE2 among different individuals. Many studies should be performed to investigate the involvement of ACE2 polymorphism with susceptibility to COVID-19. Herein, we discuss some reported associations between variants of ACE2 and COVID-19 in details. In addition, the mode of action of ACE2 and its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted which is followed by addressing the effects of several ACE2 variants on its protein stability, viral tropism or ligand-receptor affinity, secondary and tertiary structure or protein conformation, proteolytic cleavage site, and finally inter-individual clinical variability in COVID-19. The polymorphisms of regulatory regions of ACE2 and their effect on expression levels of ACE2 are also provided in this review. Such studies can improve the prediction of the affinity of mutant ACE2 variations with spike protein, and help the biopharmaceutical industry to design effective approaches for recombinant hACE2 therapy and vaccination of COVID-19 disease.","output":"Variants in ACE2; potential influences on virus infection and COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Cost savings achieved at an academic medical center by reformulating the institution's standard vasopressin infusions to reduce waste are described. SUMMARY: After a retrospective review of vasopressin utilization over a 4-month period revealed that only approximately 40% of dispensed vasopressin units were actually administered to patients, pharmacy leaders determined that the institution's standard vasopressin concentration for continuous infusions (100 units in 100 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% injection) was resulting in substantial waste, as many infusion preparations were not needed within the 18- to 24-hour expiration window. A concentration of 20 units/100 mL was adopted as the new standard formulation for vasopressin continuous infusions, with use of alternative concentrations allowed on a restricted basis. A pre-post study to assess the impact of the formulation change indicated a 38.7% decrease in vasopressin utilization (from 21,900 to 8,480 units) relative to utilization in a retrospective sample of patients who received vasopressin infusions prior to the formulation change. This reduced utilization equated to a cost decrease of $55,656.20 (as calculated on the basis of 2017 cost estimates) or $77,214.23 (as calculated on the basis of 2019 cost estimates) for the time period collected. It was estimated that the new formulations could yield annual cost savings ranging from $222,625 to $308,857. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first description of cost savings following a change in formulation of vasopressin for continuous infusions. Other institutions could consider employing a similar approach in addition to the previously reported cost-saving interventions, such as lower vasopressin starting doses and vasopressin restriction policies.","output":"A single-center cost analysis assessing a change in vasopressin formulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Routine thromboprophylaxis (TP) in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients comprises either aspirin for standard risk patients or low molecular weight heparin for high risk patients.

Recent experimental studies showed no obvious clinical signs in the infected dromedary camels. AIM: To study the pathological changes associated with natural MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels. METHODS: Tissues from three MERS-CoV positive animals as well as two negative animals were collected and examined for the presence of pathological changes. The screening of the animals was carried out first by the rapid agglutination test and then confirmed by the RT-PCR. The selected animals ranged from six to twelve months in age. The sensitivity of the latter technique was much higher in the detection of MERS-CoV than the Rapid test (14 out of 75 animals positive or 18% versus 31 out of 75 positive or 41%). RESULTS: MERS-CoV induced marked desquamation of the respiratory epithelium accompanied by lamina propria and submucosal mononuclear cells infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia in the respiratory tract, and interstitial pneumonia. Ciliary cell loss was seen in the trachea and turbinate. In addition, degeneration of glomerular capillaries with the complete destruction of glomerular tufts that were replaced with fibrinous exudate in renal corpuscles in the renal cortex were noticed. Expression of the MERS-CoV-S1 and MERS-CoV-N proteins was revealed in respiratory tract, and kidneys. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the pathological changes of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels under natural conditions. In contrast to experimental infection in case of spontaneous infection interstitial pneumonea is evident at least in some affected animals.","output":"Some pathological observations on the naturally infected dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia 2018C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We aimed to identify potential risk factors for severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and establish a prediction model based on significant factors. Methods: A total of 370 patients with COVID-19 were consecutively enrolled at The Third Peoples Hospital of Yichang from January to March 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan released by the National Health and Health Committee of China. Effect-size estimates are summarized as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: 326 patients were diagnosed with mild or ordinary COVID-19, and 44 with severe or critical COVID-19. After propensity score matching and statistical adjustment, eight factors were significantly associated with severe or critical COVID-19 (p <0.05) relative to mild or ordinary COVID-19. Due to strong pairwise correlations, only five factors, including diagnostic delay (OR, 95% CI, p: 1.08, 1.02 to 1.17, 0.048), albumin (0.82, 0.75 to 0.91, <0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (1.56, 1.14 to 2.13, 0.011), white blood cell (1.27, 1.08 to 1.50, 0.004), and neutrophil (1.40, 1.16 to 1.70, <0.001), were retained for model construction and performance assessment.

In this study, we designed a ML model for predictively stratifying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, ultimately reducing the required number of patients by increasing statistical power through cohort homogeneity. From the Philips eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, no less than 51,555 ARDS patients were extracted. We defined three subpopulations by outcome: (1) rapid death, (2) spontaneous recovery, and (3) long-stay patients. A retrospective univariate analysis identified highly predictive variables for each outcome. All 220 variables were used to determine the most accurate and generalizable model to predict long-stay patients. Multiclass gradient boosting was identified as the best-performing ML model. Whereas alterations in pH, bicarbonate or lactate proved to be strong predictors for rapid death in the univariate analysis, only the multivariate ML model was able to reliably differentiate the disease course of the long-stay outcome population (AUC of 0.77).

METHODS: An existing cohort of youth ages 16C26 in Nairobi, Kenya completed a phone-based survey in August-October 2020 (n = 1217), supplemented by virtual focus group discussions and interviews with youth and stakeholders, to examine economic, health, social, and safety experiences during COVID-19, and gender disparities therein. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk perception was high with a gender differential favoring young women (95.5% vs. 84.2%; p<0.001); youth described mixed concern and challenges to prevention. During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6% women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p<0.05) and in need of healthcare during the pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p<0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion). Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges (52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner sexual violence.

An opportunity sample of 347 participants completed a battery of online questionnaires measuring clinical perfectionism, self-critical rumination, metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-esteem, and levels of psychological distress. Several hypotheses were tested to examine the associations between the study variables. Following this, a path analysis was used to determine whether the influence of perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic striving on self-esteem is mediated by positive metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-critical rumination, and negative metacognitions about self-critical rumination, serially. Positive metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-critical rumination, and negative metacognitions about self-critical rumination partially mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and self-esteem and fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic striving and self-esteem. These results point towards possible interventions for those who struggle with low self-esteem due to their perfectionistic tendencies. Further investigations should explore additional factors that help to explain why perfectionism impacts self-esteem levels, whilst also addressing the limitations of this current research.","output":"Self-critical Rumination and Associated Metacognitions as Mediators of the Relationship Between Perfectionism and Self-esteem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Epistaxis is frequently managed with intra-nasal packing devices, traditionally requiring patient admission. Current COVID-19 guidelines encourage ambulatory care where possible in this patient cohort. This paper aims to establish the impact of the Clinical Frailty Scale, anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapeutics and season variation on pre-pandemic admissions to help identify patients suitable for ambulatory epistaxis management. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Scottish Regional Health Board PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients attending secondary care with epistaxis between March 2019 and March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Likelihood of epistaxis hospital admission based on Clinical Frailty Scale. RESULTS: 299 epistaxis presentations were identified, of which 122 (40.8%) required admission. Clinical Frailty Scale of &#8805;4 had an increased likelihood of admission (OR 3.15 (95% CI:1.94-5.16), P < .05). In the majority of presentations (66.2%), patients were taking either an antiplatelet or anticoagulant. Of these presentations, the use of an anticoagulant (OR: 2.00 (95% CI: 1.20-3.33), P < .05 and dual antiplatelet (OR: 2.82 (95% CI: 1.02-7.86), P < .05) demonstrated increased likelihood of admission. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that frailty increases the risk of admission in adult patients presenting with epistaxis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) could be utilised in risk stratification to identify suitable patients for outpatient management. Patients with CFS &#8804; 3 could be considered for outpatient management of their epistaxis. It is likely that patients with CFS &#8805;4 on anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet will require admission.","output":"The impact of frailty on epistaxis admission, a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced surgical educators to adopt new platforms for teaching. Evolving technologies in thoracic surgery require continuing education to the highest level of care. Our aim was to assess the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of live-streaming surgery in teaching novel technology to practicing surgeons. Methods: Practicing physicians (n=32) participated in a virtual course on electromagnetic localization for lung nodules. Each group of three learners participated in preoperative discussion, an interactive HIPAA-compliant live-streamed operation, and postoperative debrief. Learners completed a 20-question survey. Results: All participants were satisfied to very satisfied with the virtual experience and 97% (n=31) agreed the video platform was easy to use. Most (94%) experienced good communication between the participants, but only 12.5% of learners often to always participated. On a 1-5 Likert scale with 5 being completely satisfied, learners rated the audio quality as 4.5 and the video as 4.3. Nineteen percent of the learners experienced audio interruptions and 28% experienced video interruption during the virtual course. No respondents felt that the live-stream created a distraction during the procedure and no participants felt that the technology posed a safety risk (0%). Conclusion: Live-streaming intraoperative teaching is a safe, feasible and effective means to teach novel technologies to practicing surgeons. Improvements can be made in audio and video connectivity as well as developing tools to engage more of the learners in discussion. Future directions will focus on surgeons adoption of technology in their own practice and their comfort with the new technology.","output":"Live-streaming Intraoperative Teaching for Novel Thoracic Surgery Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study characterized the unobserved patterns in crisis response among youth in the U.S. from March to December 2020 and determined the characteristics of vulnerable subgroups who were at increased risk for suicide due to the pandemic. METHODS A latent class analysis of crisis support-seeking from a national text-based crisis platform, (n = 179,497, aged 24 years or younger) for 11 crisis concerns (e.g., depression, anxiety/stress, suicidal thoughts, isolation, abuse, bereavement, relationships) was performed on three study periods: (1) January 2017 to December 2020, (2) prepandemic: 1 January 2017 to 12 March 2020, and (3) pandemic: 13 March to 20 December 2020. Demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity) were used as predictors for class membership using the three-step method. RESULTS Four latent classes were identified: (1) depression/isolation/self-harm (D/I/S) (18,694 texters, 10.4%), (2) interpersonal stress/mood-anxiety (I/M) (32,640 texters, 18.2%), (3) suicidal thoughts/depressed (S/D) (34,067, 19.0%), and (4) adjustment/stress (A/S) (94,096 texters, 52.4%). During the pandemic, an increase in suicidal thoughts and active rescues occurred in the D/I/S and S/D higher-risk subclasses. Characteristics of vulnerable groups in higher-risk classes since the pandemic included children, LGBTQ, American Indian, White, Black, Asian, female, and gender-nonconforming youth. CONCLUSIONS Results identified a strong association with class membership in more severe risk classes during the pandemic and an increase in suicidal help-seeking, particularly among children and LGBTQ youth. Low-cost and targeted crisis text-based platforms for support-seeking in youth may be one potential safety net strategy to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in youth.","output":"Crisis Response and Suicidal Patterns in U.S. Youth Before and During COVID-19: A Latent Class Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research has shown that cerebrovascular complications following shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position under general anesthesia arise secondary to cerebral ischemia.

The aim of this study was to compare the mechanical and biofunctional performances of a nickel-titanium alloy produced by the continuous casting method (NiTi-2) with commercial nitinol (NiTi-1) manufactured by the classical process, i.e., from remelting in a vacuum furnace with electro-resistive heating and final casting into ingots. The chemical composition of the tested samples was analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) quantitative microstructural analysis was performed to determine phase distribution in the samples. As part of the mechanical properties, the hardness on the surface of samples was measured with the static Vickers method. The release of metal ions (Ni, Ti) in artificial saliva (pH 6.5) and lactic acid (pH 2.3) was measured using a static immersion test. Finally, the resulting corrosion layer was revealed by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), which allows the detection and direct measurement of the formatted oxide layer thickness. To assess the biocompatibility of the tested nickel-titanium alloy samples, an MTT test of fibroblast cellular proliferation on direct contact with the samples was performed. The obtained data were analyzed with the IBM SPSS Statistics v22 software. EDX and XRF analyses showed a higher presence of Ni in the NiTi-2 sample. The EBSD analysis detected an additional NiTi2-cubic phase in the NiTi-2 microstructure. Additionally, in the NiTi-2 higher hardness was measured. An immersion test performed in artificial saliva after 7 days did not induce significant ion release in either group of samples (NiTi-1 and NiTi-2). The acidic environment significantly increased the release of toxic ions in both types of samples. However, Ni ion release was two times lower, and Ti ion release was three times lower from NiTi-2 than from NiTi-1. Comparison of the cells' mitochondrial activity between the NiTi-1 and NiTi-2 groups did not show a statistically significant difference. In conclusion, we obtained an alloy of small diameter with an appropriate microstructure and better response compared to classic NiTi material. Thus, it appears from the present study that the continuous cast technology offers new possibilities for the production of NiTi material for usage in dentistry.","output":"Experimental Investigation of the Biofunctional Properties of Nickel-Titanium Alloys Depending on the Type of Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ongoing pandemic due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is becoming a serious global threat Experts suggest that the infection can be controlled by immediate prevention measures Sailing is one of the occupational categories more vulnerable to this virus outbreak due to the proximity of the working conditions Objective: Awareness and knowledge assessments of seafarers towards the current epidemic is mandatory to understand the effectiveness and success of the infection control measures adopted by shipping companies Methods: In this study, we presented an online questionnaire survey to determine the knowledge levels of COVID-19 among seafarers The data were collected by self-reported survey, and analysis was done by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) The t-test was used to understand the knowledge attitude differences to COVID-19 among different occupational groups of seafarers, and the p-value &le;of 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results: Among 1,458 responses received, 92 82% had a college or university degree The results reported that the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 5 82 (standard deviation = 0 51, range 0&ndash;6), and the overall correct percentage was 97% There was a statistically significant difference between age groups (F (4, 1453) = 5 44, p &lt;0 001) and educational groups (F (4, 1453) = 1 52, p &lt;0 001) The knowledge score was not significantly different across the educational status of the participants (F (2, 1455) = 1 52, p = 0 220) Conclusions: The present study highlighted good knowledge and behaviours among sailors about COVID-19 However, shipping companies need to come up with new campaigns to hold optimistic practices and suitable guidelines on ships, including cruise boats, to keep sea workers always alert and collaborative in mitigating the spread of COVID-19","output":"Assessment of Awareness and Knowledge on Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic among Seafarers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study compares the characteristics of infections from SARS-CoV-2 variants spreading during August to October 2020 vs the variants spreading during December 2020 to February 2021 among children in Israel.","output":"Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Israeli Children During the Circulation of Different SARS-CoV-2 Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly treated with corticosteroids and antiCtumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs; however, medications have well-described adverse effects. Prior work suggests that anti-TNF therapy may reduce all-cause mortality compared with prolonged corticosteroid use among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with IBD. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between use of anti-TNF or corticosteroids and all-cause mortality in a national cohort of veterans with IBD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used a well-established Veterans Health Administration cohort of 2997 patients with IBD treated with prolonged corticosteroids (3000-mg prednisone equivalent and/or 600 mg of budesonide within a 12-month period) and/or new anti-TNF therapy from January 1, 2006, to October 1, 2015. Data were analyzed between July 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Use of corticosteroids or anti-TNF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was all-cause mortality as defined by the Veterans Health Administration vital status file. Marginal structural modeling was used to compare associations between anti-TNF therapy or corticosteroid use and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2997 patients (2725 men [90.9%]; mean [SD] age, 50.0 [17.4] years) were included in the final analysis, 1734 (57.9%) with Crohn disease (CD) and 1263 (42.1%) with ulcerative colitis (UC). All-cause mortality was 8.5% (n = 256) over a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.3) years follow-up. At cohort entry, 1836 patients were new anti-TNF therapy users, and 1161 were prolonged corticosteroid users. Anti-TNF therapy use was associated with a lower likelihood of mortality for CD (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.93) but not for UC (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10-1.10). In a sensitivity analysis adjusting prolonged corticosteroid users to include patients receiving corticosteroids within 90 to 270 days after initiation of anti-TNF therapy, the OR for UC was statistically significant, at 0.33 (95% CI, 0.13-0.84), and the OR for CD was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.33-0.92). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that anti-TNF therapy may be associated with reduced mortality compared with long-term corticosteroid use among veterans with CD, and potentially among those with UC.","output":"Association of AntiCTumor Necrosis Factor Therapy With Mortality Among Veterans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoalbuminemia is associated with the acquisition and severity of infectious diseases, and intact innate and adaptive immune responses depend on albumin. Albumin oxidation and breakdown affect interactions with bioactive lipid mediators that play important roles in antimicrobial defense and repair. There is bio-mechanistic plausibility for a causal link between hypoalbuminemia and increased risks of primary and secondary infections. Serum albumin levels have prognostic value for complications in viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and for infectious complications of non-infective chronic conditions. Hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of healthcare-associated infections, particularly with Clostridium difficile. In coronavirus disease 2019, hypoalbuminemia correlates with viral load and degree of acute lung injury and organ dysfunction. Non-oncotic properties of albumin affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials. Low serum albumin is associated with inadequate antimicrobial treatment. Infusion of human albumin solution (HAS) supplements endogenous albumin in patients with cirrhosis of the liver and effectively supported antimicrobial therapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence of the beneficial effects of HAS on infections in hypoalbuminemic patients without cirrhosis is largely observational.

Assessments of this trade-off typically assume pooled specimens are independent and identically distributed. Yet, in the context of COVID-19, these assumptions are often violated: testing done on networks (housemates, spouses, co-workers) captures correlated individuals, while infection risk varies substantially across time, place and individuals. Neglecting dependencies and heterogeneity may bias established optimality grids and induce a sub-optimal implementation of the procedure. As a lesson learned from this pandemic, this paper highlights the necessity of integrating field sampling information with statistical modeling to efficiently optimize pooled testing. Using real data, we show that (a) greater gains can be achieved at low logistical cost by exploiting natural correlations (non-independence) between samples -- allowing improvements in sensitivity and efficiency of up to 30% and 90% respectively; and (b) these gains are robust despite substantial heterogeneity across pools (non-identical).

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of pediatric patients with epilepsy in Jordan. Potential predictors for seizure control during COVID-19 outbreaks were investigated. METHODS: A cross- sectional survey was conducted on pediatric patients with epilepsy in Jordan, between January and February 2021, via online questionnaires. The collected data included demographic information, epilepsy-related characteristics, views of caregivers and changes in seizure control during COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: A total number of 672 subjects were screened, 276 were eligible, and 154 completed the questionnaire adequately. Two thirds of caregivers (66.2%) reported that the COVID -19 outbreaks prevented their child from getting proper epilepsy care and 28.6% reported difficulty giving the drugs to their child on time because of loss of daily routine. In addition, more than half (55.8%) reported difficulty obtaining antiseizure medicines (ASMs). On the other hand, 77.3% of caregivers reported that seizure status remained unchanged or improved for their children during the COVID-19 and 22.7% reported worsened seizure control. The number of antiseizure medicines taken by patients (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.032), residency area (p = 0.013) and the difficulty in giving the medicine during COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.002) were the major factors influencing the seizure worsening experienced by patients.

In the present study, two networks were constructed and their hub-bottleneck and driver nodes were evaluated to consider them as target genes followed by identifying candidate genes and their associations with neurological phenotypes of COVID-19. A tripartite network was first constructed using literature-based neurological symptoms of COVID-19 as input.

Patients with a mental disorder present a unique challenge for doctors with regards to effective communication due to the nature of their illness.This literature review aimed to determine whether medical undergraduates around the world are taught psychiatric communication skills.MethodIn January 2021, the following electronic databases were searched for articles relating to medical undergraduates, the concept of psychiatric communication skills and the teaching and support of such skill development: ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SAGE and Web of Science. Combinations of keywords focussed the content of papers and truncation obtained alternative word endings. Generated articles were appraised iteratively for suitability against pre-defined inclusion criteria. The bibliographies of eligible articles were then examined to capture any further relevant studies. Ethical approval was not required.Result1040 citations of potential relevance were initially identified. Following an iterative screening process, 10 articles (from seven different countries) were eligible for inclusion. 70% of papers used the modality of simulated patients to teach psychiatric communication skills and Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) was used to create virtual patients for undergraduates to engage with. Discussing sensitive and emotive topics, such as suicide attempts or substance misuse, was less commonly taught compared to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Only 10% of papers explicitly taught medical undergraduates empathy or written communication skills and the importance placed on psychiatric teaching differed between countries.ConclusionThis literature review showed that some medical undergraduates receive psychiatric communication skills teaching, but the format and content of this varies. Increased consideration of incorporating TEL into psychiatric communications skills teaching is pertinent given undergraduates reduced face-to-face patient contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, but further work is needed to validate such technology. Written communication skills are rarely taught but are imperative given the high volume of written correspondence in clinical practice. Delivering such teaching is feasible and should be incorporated into undergraduate curricula. Medical educators need to consider cultural differences when developing psychiatric communication skills teaching. Cultural influences not only affect undergraduate perceptions of psychiatry and mental illness, but also a patient's understanding and interpretation of their illness experience. Medical undergraduates may come from various cultural backgrounds, so actively discussing these differences opportunistically may augment the ability of medical undergraduates to be empathetic and establish therapeutic rapport with patients with mental illness.","output":"A literature review of whether communication skills specific to psychiatry are being taught to medical undergraduates around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information on the immunopathobiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing; however, there remains a need to identify immune features predictive of fatal outcome.

Holistic and unbiased analyses of 17 immune cell-types were conducted on 1,075 peripheral blood samples obtained from 868 COVID-19 patients and on samples from 24 patients presenting with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections and 36 healthy donors. Immune profiles of COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those of age-matched healthy donors but generally similar to those of patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed three immunotypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection; immunotype 1 (14% of patients) was characterized by significantly lower percentages of all immune cell-types except neutrophils and circulating plasma cells, and was significantly associated with severe disease. Reduced B-cell percentage was most strongly associated with risk of death.

The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion-CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.","output":"Human species D adenovirus hexon capsid protein mediates cell entry through a direct interaction with CD46"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not been performed in healthcare workers (HCWs) yet, although HCWs are at a high risk of infection.

However, they lack precise grouping criteria and tend to vary according to each author. Among other factors, the individuals level of motivation is considered an important aspect of PA maintenance. In this study, we aimed to (1) compare several PAs according to intrinsic (Interest, Enjoyment, and Competence) and extrinsic (Appearance, Fitness/Health, and Social) motives and (2) analyze PAs with and without previous grouping to explore which PAs are more similar based on the different motivational subscales. We recruited 1,421 physically active Brazilian participants (mean age = 26.83, SD = 10.49). The participants stated which PA they practiced most frequently, and they answered the revised motivation for PA measure. The data were analyzed with multivariate general linear models and KruskalCWallis. We found that some PAs consistently differed from others regarding motivational subscales. For example, participants practicing Walking showed less Interest/Enjoyment and Competence motives than participants engaged in several other PAs. Pilates was highlighted by a particularly low level of Social motivation in comparison to other PAs. Furthermore, using the previously suggested categorization of PAs, we also showed consistent distinctions considering each motivational subscale. Specifically, one group of PA (categorized as more Complex, Team, Vigorous, Hybrid, and Combative) scored higher on intrinsic motivation, while the other group of activities (categorized as more Organized, Individual, Moderate, Strength, and Rhythmic) scored higher on Appearance and Fitness/Health motives. Our results thus provide initial evidence for possible new methods of grouping PA types that can improve maintenance behavior using motivation as a grouping factor.","output":"Comparing Different Typologies of Physical Activities With a Focus on Motivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many athletic training programs (ATPs) moved to mandatory virtual learning environments (VLEs) as access to clinical education sites was restricted for nonessential personnel, such as athletic training students (ATSs). Objective: To describe the development of a program for delivering clinical education for all ATSs through a VLE model. Background: Athletic training programs were faced with the task of delivering clinical education for all students through a virtual learning model. Further complicating the situation was that no blueprint for a VLE existed for athletic training. Description: The ATP developed clear, definitive objectives for a 6-week VLE, but afforded each clinical site the autonomy to determine how it could best implement the objectives of the VLE based upon its individual strengths and limitations. Advantage(s): Students reported increased self-motivation, improved communication skills and self-confidence, an improved ability to adapt to new situations, increased independence, personal and professional growth, the ability to stay positive and focused in the face of unexpected challenges, increased appreciation and application of evidence-based practice, and a more in-depth understanding and confidence related to organization and administration topics. Conclusion(s): Virtual learning environments offer an alternative for accomplishing the clinical education of ATSs when they cannot be physically present because of extenuating circumstances, such as a pandemic.

The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study. METHODS: This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6 months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques. The findings will help policymakers develop suitable guidelines and prevention strategies for perinatal mental health and contribute to designing tailored mental health interventions.

This work aims to classify chest radiographic images to help the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In comparison to images of healthy lungs, chest images infected by COVID-19 present geometrical deformations, like the formation of filaments. Therefore, fractal dimension is applied here to characterize the levels of complexity of COVID-19 images. Moreover, real data often contains complex patterns beyond physical features. Complex networks are suitable tools for characterizing data patterns due to their ability to capture the spatial, topological and functional relationship between the data. Therefore, a complex network-based high-level data classification technique, capable of capturing data patterns, is modified and applied to chest radiographic image classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain high classification precision on X-ray images. Still in this work, a comparative study between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art classification techniques is also carried out.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees motivation and the doctors recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees motivation and the doctors recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit.

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM.

Intention to leave ones practice within 2 years was highest among nurses (40.0%; n=921), APPs (33.0%; n=694), other clinical staff (29.4%; n=718), and physicians (23.8%; n=2204) while lowest among administrators (12.6%; n=93; all P<.001). Burnout (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 2.29 to 2.88), fear of exposure, COVID-19Crelated anxiety/depression, and workload were predictors of intent to leave. Feeling valued by ones organization was protective of reducing hours (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.72) and intending to leave (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.45; all P<.01). CONCLUSION: Approximately 1 in 3 physicians, APPs, and nurses surveyed intend to reduce work hours. One in 5 physicians and 2 in 5 nurses intend to leave their practice altogether. Reducing burnout and improving a sense of feeling valued may allow health care organizations to better maintain their workforces postpandemic.","output":"COVID-Related Stress and Work Intentions in a Sample of US Health Care Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to the respiratory compromise typical for COVID-19 many papers reported on the thromboembolic complications in these often critically ill patients.

The main objective was to compare the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 versus patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Methods This is an observational controlled-cohort study performed at a single center of a university teaching hospital in France. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was prospectively assessed using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and compared to patients from a 3-year historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. In patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, CTPA was performed approximately 7 days after intubation or earlier in case of respiratory or hemodynamic worsening. Results CTPA was performed in 29 out of the 42 patients (69%) with ARDS related to COVID-19 and in 51 out of the 156 patients (33%) from the historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 40% (17/42) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 3% (5/156) in the historical cohort (P=0.001). The proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism among all patients who had CTPA was 59% (17/29) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 10% (5/51) in the historical cohort (P=0.0001). After adjustment on the interval between ICU admission and computed tomography, COVID-19 remained independently associated with pulmonary embolism. Conclusions Pulmonary embolism was particularly frequent in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, thereby suggesting that CTPA should be systematically performed in these patients.","output":"High risk of pulmonary embolism in acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19: an observational controlled-cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

COVID-19 pandemics has affected many elective surgical procedures like hernia repairs. We assumed that the declines in case volumes might cause some falls in related publications, and searched the literature in order to find the number of herniology publications before and during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic PUBMED search was done for three consecutive decades 1991-2000, 2001-2010 and 2011-2020 by using the key words inguinal and hernia, umbilical and hernia, incisional and hernia, mesh and hernia, laparoscopic and hernia, robotic and hernia, and experimental and hernia. Later, a comparison of years 2019 and 202o was done. RESULTS: Although increases were detected for all searches with the key words, the largest rise was seen in publications related to robotic and hernia. Some undulations were recorded during the years, but the number of publications showed obvious increases decade by decade. A very small decrease was found in the number of publications for experimental and hernia only, however all other searches presented increases during the first year of the pandemic, 2020 in comparison with 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in the number of publications in hernia field continued during the last decade. COVID-19 pandemic did not cause a decrease in these publications the first year.

Here, we contextualize SARS-CoV-2 among other coronaviruses and identify what is known and what can be inferred about its behavior once inside a human host. Because the genomic content of coronaviruses, which specifies the virus's structure, is highly conserved, early genomic analysis provided a significant head start in predicting viral pathogenesis and in understanding potential differences among variants. The pathogenesis of the virus offers insights into symptomatology, transmission, and individual susceptibility. Additionally, prior research into interactions between the human immune system and coronaviruses has identified how these viruses can evade the immune system's protective mechanisms. We also explore systems-level research into the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response. Understanding the structure and behavior of the virus serves to contextualize the many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic and can influence efforts to control the virus and treat the disease.","output":"Pathogenesis, Symptomatology, and Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through Analysis of Viral Genomics and Structure (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applications for bowel US in children have been well described; however, less focus has been placed on patterns of bowel wall architectural change in specific disease states.

It is associated with increased activation of the clotting system leading to thrombotic complications in 5 to 23% of cases[1]. It is known to cause significant venous thromboembolism and few cases with arterial thrombosis with increased risk of life-threatening complications like myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, splenic infarct, and left ventricular clot have been reported[2]. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, Hypertension, COPD, recent COVID-19 (3 weeks ago) not requiring admission to hospital presented to the hospital with bilateral leg and forearm pain. Leg pain was worse with activity. She had feeble peripheral pulses on palpation.She underwent Computed Tomography angiography which showed extensive arterial thrombosis involving the distal abdominal aorta, left common iliac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and also showed an area of wedge-shaped infarction in the spleen. She had a thrombus at the apex of the left ventricle, with incidental 1.3 cm spiculated mass in the left lung. There was no evidence of venous thromboembolism in imaging.She was started on therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin. After multidisciplinary discussion with Hematology, Vascular surgery, and Cardiology, her anticoagulation was changed to Enoxaparin. She was managed medically. Workup including JAK2, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies was negative. DISCUSSION: The exact mechanisms that activate coagulation cascade in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown, but they are found to be associated with increased thrombogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 viral infection can activate the plasmatic clotting system by activating multiple procoagulant pathways. Angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 are normally found on various cells such as lymphocytes, alveolar cells, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, Surface S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target transmembrane receptor( ACE2 protein) and down-regulates the expression of ACE2 protein. It leads to the accumulation of angiotensin II in the body which interacts with platelets and endothelial cells leading to further promotion of clot formation[3]. This was the likely cause of hypercoagulable state in our patient leading to thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: An extensive arterial clot can be the initial presentation in COVID-19 patients and can be treated promptly with anticoagulation. Early introduction of prophylactic anticoagulation is necessary to prevent clot formation. REFERENCE #1:.Thromboinflammation and the hypercoagulability of COVID-19.

PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility criteria included age >16 years, being of foreign origin and living without valid residency permit in the country of recruitment. A convenience sample of minimum 100 patients per study site was targeted. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected using an anonymous structured questionnaire. The main outcomes were perceived access to the local COVID-19 vaccination programme and demand for vaccination. RESULTS: Altogether, 812 undocumented migrants participated (54.3% Geneva, 17.5% Baltimore, 15.5% Milano and 12.7% Paris). Most (60.9%) were women. The median age was 39 years (interquartile range 1).

Prior work has suggested that collateral thermal damage resulting from electrocautery use during skin flap development is a potential source of this complication. This report describes the case of a smoker with recurrent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who experienced significant unilateral skin necrosis following bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy while participating in a clinical trial examining mastectomy outcomes with two different surgical devices. This unexpected complication has implications for the choice of dissection devices in procedures requiring skin flap preservation. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who was a smoker with recurrent DCIS of her right breast. As part of the clinical trial, each breast was randomized to either the standard of care treatment group (a scalpel and a traditional electrosurgical device) or treatment with a novel, low thermal injury dissection device, allowing for a direct, internally controlled comparison of surgical outcomes. Post-operative follow-up at six days was unremarkable for both operative sites. At 16 days post-surgery, the patient presented with a significant wound necrosis in the mastectomy site randomized to the control study group. Following debridement and closure, this site progressively healed over 10 weeks. The contralateral mastectomy, randomized to the alternative device, healed normally. CONCLUSION We hypothesize that thermal damage to the subcutaneous microvasculature during flap dissection may have contributed to this complication and that the use of a low thermal injury dissection device may be advantageous in select patients undergoing skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomy.","output":"Traditional electrosurgery and a low thermal injury dissection device yield different outcomes following bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the impact of vocal deviation in the quality of life of classical female singers over the quarantine imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic through self-assessments.

In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) may contribute to significant stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of non-pharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing non-pharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each non-pharamacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving ones mental health such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied post-partum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Though some of these non-pharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend towards inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake , ensure each option is available at home, and a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.","output":"Effects of psychological stress on adverse pregnancy outcomes and non-pharmacologic approaches for reduction: an expert review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is important for drivers who are responsible for the lives of passengers to remain in a calm state of mind and body suitable for driving. The objective of this study is to grasp the drivers state by using physiological data that can be continuously and relatively easily measured.

Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 PSW. Data was analyzed with content analysis. Three themes were constructed; \\"Experience of stigma\\", \\"Authenticity and balance in the patient relationship\\" and \\"Opportunities and setbacks in the team\\". Challenges included stigmatization, loyalty conflicts, lack of a clear job description and feelings of insecurity and disinterest among other staff. However, the peer support role was perceived as deeply meaningful. The peer support role comes with challenges and opportunities for the PSW, and potentially for the patients and the surrounding work team.

Accordingly, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended to improve SARS-CoV-2 surveillance on household animals to assess the risk of transmission between species. Following such recommendation, we studied the potential SARS-CoV-2 infection in household dogs and cats in the city of Guayaquil, the most populated city in Ecuador. Methods Oral and nasal swab samples were collected from dogs and cats within 10 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result of their owners. Total RNA was extracted and detection of viral gene targets N and ORF1ab was performed by RT-qPCR. Results From the 50 cats and dogs tested, 12 resulted SARS-CoV-2 positive, giving a total positivity rate of 24%. One out of 8 cats tested positive, while 11 out of 42 dogs were positive, yielding a positivity rate of 12.5% and 26.2%, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by Whole Genome Sequencing. In addition, we also found a statistically significant association between SARS-CoV-2 pet positivity and food sharing with infected owners. Conclusions This current study is the second active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in household dogs and cats in Latin America. Moreover, it is the first study addressing risk factor associated to potential anthropogenic SARS-CoV-2 transmission to domestic cats and dogs. Given the high presence of free roaming dogs and cats in rural and urban areas in Latin American countries, and the high capacity shown by coronaviruses for interspecies transmission, our findings support the view that SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in pets is necessary to better understand the role that pet-human interaction plays in COVID-19 spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission from infected owner to household dogs and cats is associated to food sharing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a change in physiology resulting from mechanical causes, trauma, or sepsis. Neurological manifestations of FES can vary from mild cognitive changes to coma and even cerebral oedema and brain death. Here, we present an unusual case of cerebral fat emboli that occurred in the absence of acute chest syndrome or right-to-left shunt. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 57-year-old right-handed male was admitted to our department because of unconsciousness after a car accident for 3 days. He suffered from multiple fractures of the bilateral lower extremities and pelvis. This patient had severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Head MRI showed multiple small lesions in the whole brain consistent with a star field pattern, including high signals on T2-weighted (T2w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in the bilateral centrum semiovale; both frontal, parietal and occipital lobes; and brainstem, cerebellar hemisphere, and deep and subcortical white matter. Intravenous methylprednisolone, heparin, mannitol, antibiotics and nutritional support were used. Although this patient had severe symptoms at first, the outcome was favourable. CONCLUSIONS: When patients have long bone and pelvic fractures, multiple bone fractures and deteriorated neurological status, cerebral fat embolism (CFE) should be considered. Additionally, CFE may occur without an intracardiac shunt. The early diagnosis and appropriate management of FES are important, and prior to and following surgery, patients should be monitored comprehensively in the intensive care unit. With appropriate treatment, CFE patients may achieve good results.","output":"Post\\\\traumatic cerebral fat embolism syndrome with a favourable outcome: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandmie de COVID-19 a mis  rude preuve notre capacit  nous adapter et a engendr beaucoup de stress.

The aim of this study was to further investigate the efficacy and safety of IC in SARS-CoV-2 infection in advanced in vitro models of the human respiratory epithelium, the primary target and entry port for SARS-CoV-2. We extended the in vitro safety assessment of nebulized IC in a 3-dimensional model of reconstituted human bronchial epithelium, and we demonstrated the efficacy of IC in protecting reconstituted nasal epithelium against viral infection and replication of a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 strain. The results obtained from these two advanced models of human respiratory tract epithelia confirm previous findings from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection assays and demonstrate that topically applied IC can effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.

The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C(3)HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the enforcement of infection control guidelines for patients with COVID-19 during medical imaging procedures and raise awareness of infection control in different hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A total of 128 responses were collected from four hospitals across Saudi Arabia using a new structured questionnaire, which was created for health workers by the WHO specifically for this purpose. Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. Results: Most participants correctly followed the guidelines of the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on infection control in the X-ray and general radiology departments. Guideline awareness was higher among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT) radiographers, which reduced the risk of future infections. Out of the total respondents, 98.4% stated that they had received formal training in hand hygiene. Only 40.6% of participants, however, knew that respiratory droplets are the primary mode of transmission of the virus from person to person.

This uncertainty creates a complex dynamic between the clinicians conception of MCI, what is communicated to the individual about their condition, and how the individual responds to the information conveyed to them. The aim of this study was to explore clinicians views around the assessment and communication of MCI in memory clinics. METHOD: As part of a larger longitudinal study looking at patients adjustment to MCI disclosure, we interviewed Old Age Psychiatrists at the five participating sites across Scotland. The study obtained ethics approvals and the interviews (carried out between Nov 2020CJan 2021) followed a semi-structured schedule focusing on [1] how likely clinicians are to use the term MCI with patients; [2] what tests clinicians rely on and how much utility they see in them; and [3] how clinicians communicate risk of progression to dementia. The interviews were voice recorded and were analysed using reflective thematic analysis. RESULTS: Initial results show that most clinicians interviewed (Total N = 19) considered MCI to have significant limitations as a diagnostic term. Nevertheless, most clinicians reported using the term MCI (n = 15/19). Clinical history was commonly described as the primary aid in the diagnostic process and also to rule out functional impairment (which was sometimes corroborated by Occupational Therapy assessment). All clinicians reported using the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination-III as a primary assessment tool. Neuroimaging was frequently found to have minimal usefulness due to the neuroradiological reports being non-specific. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a mixture of approaches to assessing and disclosing test results for MCI. Some clinicians consider the condition as a separate entity among neurodegenerative disorders whereas others find the term unhelpful due to its uncertain prognosis. Clinicians report a lack of specific and sensitive assessment methods for identifying the aetiology of MCI in clinical practice. Our study demonstrates a broad range of views and therefore variability in MCI risk disclosure in memory assessment services which may impact the management of individuals with MCI.

These masks have a custom-made adaptor which allows the fitment of standard medical respiratory filters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fit, seal and clinical usability of these masks. METHODS: This multicentre, non-blinded in-situ simulation study recruited fifty-two HCWs to don and doff the adapted snorkel mask. Negative pressure seal checks and a qualitative fit test were performed. The HCWs completed intubation and extubation of a manikin in a university skills training laboratory, followed by a web-based questionnaire on the clinical usability of the masks. RESULTS: Whilst fit and usability data were generally satisfactory, two of the 52 participants (3.8%) felt that the mask did not span the correct distance from the nose to the chin, and 3 of 34 participants (8.8%) who underwent qualitative testing with a Bitrex test failed. The majority of users reported no fogging, humidity or irritation. It was reportedly easy to speak while wearing the mask, although some participants perceived that they were not always understood. Twenty-one participants (40%) experienced a subjective physiological effect from wearing the mask; most commonly a sensation of shortness of breath. DISCUSSION: A fit-tested modified full-face snorkel mask may offer benefit as a substitute for N95 respirators and face shields. It is, however, important to properly select the correct mask based on size, fit testing, quality of the three-dimensional (3D) printed parts and respiratory filter to be used.

METHODS We conducted an observational cross-sectional study using an online survey sent to rheumatologists of each non-English-speaking country member of the Pan American League of Rheumatology Associations (PANLAR). A specific questionnaire was developed. RESULTS Our survey included 1097 rheumatologists from 19 Latin American countries. Median (IQR) age of respondents was 48 (40-59) years and 618 (56.3%) were female. Duration of practice since graduation as a rheumatologist was 17 years, and 585 (53.3%) were aged < 50 years. Most rheumatologists worked in private practice (81.8%) and almost half worked in institutional outpatient centers (55%) and inpatient care (49.9%). The median number of weekly hours (IQR) of face-to-face practice before the pandemic was 27 (15-40) hours, but was reduced to 10 (5-20) hours during the pandemic. Telehealth was used by 866 (78.9%) respondents during the pandemic. Most common methods of communication were video calls (555; 50.6%), telephone calls (499; 45.5%), and WhatsApp voice calls (423; 38.6%). A reduction in monthly wages was reported by 946 (86.2%) respondents. Consultation fees also were reduced and 88 (8%) rheumatologists stated they had lost their jobs. A reduction in patient adherence to medication was reported by nearly 50% of respondents. Eighty-one (7.4%) rheumatologists received a COVID-19 diagnosis and 7 (8.6%) of them were hospitalized.

OBJECTIVE: The initially identified pulmonary damage patterns, such as diffuse alveolar damage in acute lung failure, are accompanied by new findings that draw a more complex scenario. These include microvascular involvement and a wide range of associated pathologies of multiple organ systems. A back-scaling of microstructural vascular changes is possible via targeted correlation of pathological autopsy results with radiological imaging. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiological and pathological correlation as well as microradiological imaging to investigate microvascular involvement in fatal COVID-19. RESULTS: The cases of two COVID-19 patients are presented. Patient 1 showed a relative hypoperfusion in lung regions that did not have typical COVID-19 infiltrates; the targeted post-mortem correlation also showed subtle signs of microvascular damage even in these lung sections. Patient 2 showed both radiologically and pathologically advanced typical COVID-19 destruction of lung structures and the case illustrates the damage patterns of the blood-air barrier. The perfusion deficit of the intestinal wall shown in computed tomography of patient 2 could not ultimately clearly be microscopically attributed to intestinal microvascular damage. CONCLUSION: In addition to microvascular thrombosis, our results indicate a functional pulmonary vasodysregulation as part of the pathophysiology during the vascular phase of COVID-19. The clinical relevance of autopsies and the integration of radiological imaging findings into histopathological injury patterns must be emphasized for a better understanding of COVID-19.","output":"Mikrovaskul?re Ver?nderungen bei COVID-19./ [Microvascular changes in COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the quantitative DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals consulting their general practioner (GP) during a period of stable intense virus circulation (213/100,000 habitants per day).

A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future.

METHODS A systematic review of perioperative mortality risk prediction tools used for adults undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery, published between 2011 and 2019 (following an earlier systematic review). We searched Medline via OVID using medical subject headings consistent with the three main areas of risk, surgery and mortality/morbidity. A similar search was conducted in Embase. Tools predicting morbidity but not mortality were excluded, as were those predicting a composite outcome that did not report predictive performance for mortality separately. Tools were also excluded if they were specifically designed for use in cardiac or other highly specialized surgery, emergency surgery, paediatrics or elderly patients. RESULTS Literature search identified 2568 studies for screening, of which 19 studies identified 21 risk prediction tools for inclusion. CONCLUSION Four tools are candidates for adapting in the Australian context, including the Surgical Mortality Probability Model (SMPM), Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM), Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT) and NZRISK. SORT has similar predictive performance to POSPOM, using only six variables instead of 17, contains all variables of the SMPM, and the original model developed in the UK has already been successfully adapted in New Zealand as NZRISK.

Firstly, MSCs were successfully isolated from human bone marrow (BM), but in the next steps, they were also extracted from other sources, mostly from the umbilical cord (UC) and adipose tissue (AT). The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has suggested minimum criteria to identify and characterize MSCs as follows: plastic adherence, surface expression of CD73, D90, CD105 in the lack of expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, and human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and also the capability to differentiate to multiple cell types including adipocyte, chondrocyte, or osteoblast in vitro depends on culture conditions. However, these distinct properties, including self-renewability, multipotency, and easy accessibility are just one side of the coin; another side is their huge secretome which is comprised of hundreds of mediators, cytokines, and signaling molecules and can effectively modulate the inflammatory responses and control the infiltration process that finally leads to a regulated tissue repair/healing or regeneration process. MSC-mediated immunomodulation is a direct result of a harmonic synergy of MSC-released signaling molecules (i.e., mediators, cytokines, and chemokines), the reaction of immune cells and other target cells to those molecules, and also feedback in the MSC-molecule-target cell axis. These features make MSCs a respectable and eligible therapeutic candidate to be evaluated in immune-mediated disorders, such as graft versus host diseases (GVHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Crohn's disease (CD), and osteoarthritis (OA), and even in immune-dysregulating infectious diseases such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper discussed the therapeutic applications of MSC secretome and its biomedical aspects related to immune-mediated conditions. Sources for MSC extraction, their migration and homing properties, therapeutic molecules released by MSCs, and the pathways and molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the exceptional immunoregulatory competence of MSCs were discussed. Besides, the novel discoveries and recent findings on immunomodulatory plasticity of MSCs, clinical applications, and the methods required for their use as an effective therapeutic option in patients with immune-mediated/immune-dysregulating diseases were highlighted.","output":"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells as a valuable source for the treatment of immune-mediated disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The progression of secondary pulmonary damage in SARS-COV-2 infection, associated with interstitial damage, inflammation and alveolar consolidation and eventually resulted in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), remains one of the key clinical dilemmas for the treatment of patients in intensive care units (ICU).

Therefore, in this study, a murine model of asthma has been established in which sensitization against the major grass pollen allergen Phl p5b was performed without using aluminum hydroxide (alum). We used this model for specific immunotherapy. Methods: Female, 5-6-week-old mice were sensitized by six subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 20 g Phl p5b followed by four provocations to induce allergic airway inflammation. For desensitization, 1 mg of Phl p5b was injected subcutaneously during allergen challenge for one to a maximum of four times. Three days after the last challenge, the allergic immune response was analyzed. Results: Sensitized and challenged animals showed a significant infiltration of eosinophils into the airways, and the production of interleukin-5 (IL-5) by in vitro re-stimulated splenocytes could be detected. Furthermore, hyper-responsiveness of the airways was verified by invasive measurement of airway resistance in methacholine-challenged animals. Desensitized animals showed a significant reduction of all parameters. Conclusion: In this study, a murine model of asthma has successfully been established by sensitization against the clinically relevant allergen Phl p5b without using alum.

METHODS All newly diagnosed cases of CRC between 1980 and 2010 were obtained from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. RESULTS Of the 18,782 patients diagnosed with CRC, 134 were diagnosed with synchronous CRC (0.71%) and 300 were diagnosed with metachronous CRC (1.60%). The risk for synchronous CRC was significantly higher in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.06) and in patients aged 65 years or older (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02-2.21). Synchronous CRCs were located more often in the proximal colon (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20-2.41). First-degree relatives of cases with synchronous (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.37-2.53), metachronous (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.62-3.36), or solitary CRC (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.63-1.88) were at increased risk for developing CRC, compared with relatives of CRC-free individuals. Four percent of first-degree relatives of patients with synchronous or metachronous cancer developed CRC at younger ages than the age recommended for initiating CRC screening (based on familial risk), and therefore would not have been screened. CONCLUSIONS Of patients diagnosed with CRC, 2.3% are found to have synchronous lesions or develop metachronous CRC during follow-up evaluation. Relatives of these patients have a greater risk of CRC than those without a family history of CRC.

After adjustment, COVID-19 was associated with lower odds of myocardial injury compared to non-COVID ARDS (OR 0.55 95% CI 0.36-0.84, P=0.005). Conclusions: Myocardial injury in severe COVID-19 is a function of baseline comorbidities, advanced age and multisystem organ dysfunction similar to traditional ARDS. The adverse prognosis of myocardial injury in COVID-19 relates largely to multisystem organ involvement and critical illness.","output":"Myocardial Injury in Severe COVID-19 Compared to Non-COVID Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic are yet undefined, but behavioral and lifestyle consequences of the containment measures may cause weight changes, with different concerns across demographic groups. Our aim was to determine weight changes based on the data collected from same individuals before (2017) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants aged 25+ years, from the nationally representative FinHealth 2017 Study and its follow-up survey in autumn 2020, with information on self-reported weight in both years were included (n = 4770). Weight maintenance was defined as <  5% change in body weight for each individual (i.e. weight loss = 5% loss; weight gain = 5% gain). Prevalence was estimated using inverse probability weights, acknowledging sampling design and non-response. RESULTS: Overall, two thirds of the population maintained weight during follow-up, but prevalence rates for weight change differed by age and sex. Prevalence of weight loss was highest among 70+ year olds (22% in men, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17-27; 26% in women, 95% CI 22-30), while they rarely experienced weight gain. Among 50-69 year olds weight gain was as common as loss, being around 15% for both indicators and sexes. Prevalence of weight gain was highest among 25-49 year olds (20% in men, 95% CI 18-23; 36% in women, 95% CI 33-40). Men with lowest education had gained weight more often (24%, 95% CI 19-30) than those with middle (16%, 95% CI 14-19) or high (14%, 95% CI 12-16) education, while for women no differences emerged, the prevalence ranging between 20-24% by education. CONCLUSIONS: The weight loss among 70+ year olds seems worrying, but might be age related. Moreover, younger women and men with low education gained weight, groups known to be vulnerable for weight gain. Further analyses are required to evaluate whether containment measures related to COVID-19 pandemic have caused additional change compared to ageing and time related change. KEY MESSAGES: Few weight changes were observed in the Finnish adult population. As weight gain/loss may take longer time to develop, further studies are needed to address the long term effects of COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid increasing health inequity after pandemic, public health promotion should stress obesity prevention among young women plus men with low education. Weight loss is a concern among the elderly.","output":"Individual level changes in body weight among Finnish adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns regarding gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and associated apnea episodes result in some practitioners having convalescent, prematurely born infants sleep in the prone position. We have tested the hypothesis that such infants would not suffer from clinically important acid GER or associated apnea episodes more in the supine compared with the prone position. Lower esophageal pH was measured and videopolysomnographic recordings of nasal airflow, chest and abdominal wall movements, electrocardiographic activity, and oxygen saturation were made on two successive days of 21 premature infants (median gestational age 28 wk) at a median postmenstrual age (PMA) of 36 wk. On each day, the infants were studied prone and supine. The acid reflux index was higher in the supine compared with the prone position (median 3% versus 0%, p = 0.002), but was low in both positions. The number of obstructive apnea episodes per hour was higher in the supine position (p = 0.008). There were, however, no statistically significant correlations between the amount of acid GER and the number of either obstructive or total apnea episodes in either the supine or prone position. Supine compared with prone sleeping neither increases clinically important acid GER nor obstructive apnea episodes associated with acid GER in asymptomatic, convalescent, prematurely born infants.","output":"Acid gastroesophageal reflux in convalescent preterm infants: effect of posture and relationship to apnea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing and analysis for informed public health decision-making in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collagen is the basic protein of animal tissues and has a complex hierarchical structure.

Whole genome sequencing and genetic analyses of fifty-eight SARS-CoV-2 samples collected during one-year between March 2020 and March 2021 from the National Influenza Center were performed using three sampling strategies.. Multiple lineage introductions were noted during the initial phase of the pandemic, including B.4, B.1.1, B.1.428.2, B.1.540 and B.1.1.189. Subsequently, lineages B1.160 (24.2%) and B1.177 (22.4%) were dominant throughout the year. The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage) was identified in February 2021 and firstly observed in the center of our country. In addition, A clear diversity of lineages was observed in the North of the country. A total of 335 mutations including 10 deletions were found. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins ORF1ab, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid were observed as mutation hotspots with a mutation frequency exceeding 20%. The 2 most frequent mutations, D614G in S protein and P314L in Nsp12 appeared simultaneously and are often associated with increased viral infectivity. Interestingly, deletions in coding regions causing consequent deletions of amino acids and frame shifts were identified in NSP3, NSP6, S, E, ORF7a, ORF8 and N proteins. These findings contribute to define the COVID-19 outbreak in Tunisia.

While the risks of OCS are well known, the benefit remains unclear due the absence of a standardized prescribing regimen. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize whether the risks of OCS and its ability to avert endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) are helpful in AMT. When OCS is highly effective at averting surgery, the lesser risks of OCS would be justified because it can avoid the greater risks of ESS. When OCS is poorly effective at averting ESS, the risks of OCS would not be justified because many patients will be exposed to both risks. This study seeks to identify the threshold effectiveness of OCS at averting ESS that would minimize risk exposure to patients. METHODS A probabilistic risks-based decision analysis was constructed from literature reported incidences and impacts of adverse events of OCS and ESS. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to identify the minimum effectiveness required to avoid further intervention (MERAFI) for chronic sinusitis without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). RESULTS The analysis showed MERAFI results of 20.8% (95% CI 20.7-20.9%) for CRSsNP and 16.8% (95% CI 16.7-16.9%) for CRSwNP. CONCLUSIONS Given reported OCS effectiveness in the range of 34-71% in CRSsNP and 46-63% in CRSwNP, this analysis suggests that the inclusion of OCS in AMT may be the lower risk strategy.

She had undergone loop gastric bypass with Braun anastomosis in 2009 at another center for morbid obesity (BMI = 43 kg/m2). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was created after the separation of gastro-jejunostomy (GJ) and jejuno-jejunostomy (JJ). On the fifth postoperative day, the patient was readmitted with signs of peritonitis. Urgent relaparoscopy showed Biliopancreatic limb (BP) obstruction. It was then and that we understood intraoperatively the uncut Roux-en-Y caused stricture between the previous GJ and JJ staple lines. Side-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy between the proximal dilated and the distal collapsed biliopancreatic limb was performed.

(2) Methods: Randomised controlled trials comparing alcohol-based interventions for surgical site skin preparation were included. The proportion of SSIs was compared using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The meta-analysis was performed with a fixed effect model using Mantel-Haenszel methods. As an a priori subgroup analysis SSI risk was examined according to different surgical procedural groups. (3) Results: Thirteen studies were included (n = 6023 participants). The use of chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with a reduction in risk of SSIs compared with iodophor-alcohol (RR 0.790; 95% CI 0.669, 0.932). On sub-group analysis, chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with a reduction in SSIs in caesarean surgery (RR 0.614; 95% CI 0.453, 0.831) however, chlorhexidine-alcohol was associated with an increased risk of SSI in bone and joint surgery (RR 2.667; 95% CI 1.051, 6.765).

Depressive symptoms were measured on seven occasions (21st March - 2nd April), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic vulnerabilities included non-white ethnic background, low socio-economic position (SEP), and type of work (keyworker versus no keyworker). Health-related and psychosocial vulnerabilities included pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological and/or physical abuse, and low social support. Group-based DST were derived using latent growth mixture modelling and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between these vulnerabilities and DSTs. Model estimates were adjusted for age, sex, and suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Three DSTs were identified: low [N=30,850 (60%)] moderate [N=14,911 (29%)], and severe [N=5,656 (11%)] depressive symptoms. DSTs were relatively stable across the first 6 weeks of lockdown.

When those measures were first implemented in March 2020 by the UK Government, it was thought that human rights obligations would limit excesses of governmental action and that the public had more to fear from unwarranted intrusion into civil liberties. However, within the first year of the pandemics devastation in the UK, a different picture has emerged: rather than through action, it is governmental inaction that has given rise to greater human rights concerns. The UK Government has been roundly criticized for its inadequate response, including missteps in decision-making, delayed implementation and poor enforcement of lockdown measures, abandonment of testing, shortages of critical resources and inadequate test and trace methods.

The microwell array device consisted of three-dimensional microband electrodes by assembling both upper and lower substrates perpendicularly. Arrays of hybridomas secreting specific antibodies were prepared by aligning hybridomas in each microwell based on the attractive force of positive dielectrophoresis (p-DEP). Antibody secreted by the hybridomas in the microwells was recognized by the antigen immobilized on the microwells or the membrane surfaces of hybridomas to discriminate hybridomas with the secretion ability. Thereafter, a repulsive force of negative dielectrophoresis (n-DEP) was applied to release the target hybridomas from the microwell array. To harvest the target hybridoma, AC signals could be modulated in the n-DEP frequency region and applied to a pair of microband electrodes located above and below each microwell containing target hybridoma. Thus, the cell-based array system described in this study allowed selective retrieval of single target hybridomas by merely switching from p-DEP to n-DEP after selecting the antibody-secreting hybridomas trapped in each microwell.

Of note, COVID-19+ women deliver earlier than COVID-19- women, and the risk for severe neonatal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is significantly higher. The probability and pathways of vertical transmission of the virus from the pregnant woman to the fetus are highly controversial. Recent data have shown that 54 (13%) of 416 neonates born to COVID-19-positive women were infected. Here, we investigated term placentas collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and studied the main COVID-19 receptors ACE2, TMPRSS2, as well as NRP1. We performed qPCR and immunofluorescence on cryosections in combination with markers for syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, macrophages and stromal cells. The qPCR studies showed expression of both the truncated delta form of ACE2, which does not bind the COVID-19 spike protein, and the long form. The ACE2 antibody used does not distinguish between the two forms. We did not observe expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery on syncytio- and cytotrophoblast. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of stromal cells, which in part are CD68-positive macrophages. NRP1 is localized to endothelial cells.

This method is applied to identify the novel therapeutic agents from the existing FDA approved clinically used drug molecules. It is considered as an efficient approach to develop drug candidates with new pharmacological activities or therapeutic properties. As the drug discovery is a costly, time-consuming, laborious, and highly risk process, the novel approach of drug repositioning is employed to increases the success rate of drug development. This strategy is more advantageous over traditional drug discovery process in terms of reducing duration of drug development, low-cost, highly efficient and minimum risk of failure. In addition to this, World health organization declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as pandemic globally on February 11, 2020. Currently, there is an urgent need to develop suitable therapeutic agents for the prevention of the outbreak of COVID-19. So, various investigations were carried out to design novel drug molecules by utilizing different approaches of drug repurposing to identify drug substances for treatment of COVID-19, which can act as significant inhibitors against viral proteins. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect human respiratory system by entering into the alveoli of lung via respiratory tract. So, the infection occurs due to specific interaction or binding of spike protein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. Hence, drug repurposing strategy is utilized to identify suitable drugs by virtual screening of drug libraries. This approach helps to determine the binding interaction of drug candidates with target protein of coronavirus by using computational tools such as molecular similarity and homology modeling etc. For predicting the drug-receptor interactions and binding affinity, molecular docking study and binding free energy calculations are also performed. The methodologies involved in drug repurposing can be categorized into three groups such as drug-oriented, target-oriented and disease or therapy-oriented depending on the information available related to quality and quantity of the physico-chemical, biological, pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic property of drug molecules. This review focuses on drug repurposing strategy applied for existing drugs including Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, Baraticinib, Tocilizumab, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Prulifloxacin, Carfilzomib, Bictegravir, Nelfinavir, Tegobuvir and Glucocorticoids etc to determine their effectiveness toward the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Drug Repurposing Strategy (DRS): Emerging Approach to Identify Potential Therapeutics for Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melatonin is a chronobiotic hormone, which can regulate human diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, respiratory disorders, and microbial infections by regulating redox system. Melatonin exhibits innate immunomodulation by communicating with immune system and influencing neutrophils to fight infections and inflammation. However, sustaining redox homeostasis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in neutrophils are critical during chemotaxis, oxidative burst, phagocytosis, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Therefore, endogenous antioxidant glutathione (GSH) redox cycle is highly vital in regulating neutrophil functions. Reduced intracellular GSH levels and glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the neutrophils during clinical conditions like autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, and microbial infections lead to dysfunctional neutrophils. Therefore, we hypothesized that redox modulators like melatonin can protect neutrophil health and functions under GSH and GR activity-deficient conditions. We demonstrate the dual role of melatonin, wherein it protects neutrophils from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS generation; in contrast, it restores neutrophil functions like phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis in GSH and GR activity-deficient neutrophils by regulating ROS levels both in vitro and in vivo. Melatonin mitigates LPS-induced neutrophil dysfunctions by rejuvenating GSH redox system, specifically GR activity by acting as a parallel redox system. Our results indicate that melatonin could be a potential auxiliary therapy to treat immune dysfunction and microbial infections, including virus, under chronic disease conditions by restoring neutrophil functions. Further, melatonin could be a promising immune system booster to fight unprecedented pandemics like the current COVID-19. However, further studies are indispensable to address the clinical usage of melatonin.","output":"Melatonin restores neutrophil functions and prevents apoptosis amid dysfunctional glutathione redox system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This study examined whether the presence and severity of Type 1 Respiratory Failure (T1RF), as measured by the ratio of pulse oximetry to estimated fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/eFiO2 ratio), is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the ED with suspected COVID19 infection. Methods We undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 in a single ED in England. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine whether the presence and severity of T1RF in the ED was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Results 180 patients with suspected COVID19 infection met the inclusion criteria for this study, of which 39 (22%) died. Severity of T1RF was associated with increased mortality with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.58 (0.49 to 5.14), 3.60 (1.23 to 10.6) and 18.5 (5.65 to 60.8) for mild, moderate and severe T1RF, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, neutrophil-lymphocyte ration (NLR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the association remained, with ORs of 0.63 (0.13 to 3.03), 3.95 (0.94 to 16.6) and 45.8 (7.25 to 290). The results were consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Severity of T1RF in the ED is an important prognostic factor of mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID19 infection.

Currently, Statins remains to be the mainstay therapy for dyslipidemia but this is also met by problems within certain patient population. The drug may be contraindicated in certain patient groups;some patients tend to not respond to Statins;while certain patients may not tolerate the adverse events. This study looked into available literature on studies done on dyslipidemia using plant-based formulations using randomized clinical trial. Based on the review conducted, there are several plant-based formations with potential to be similar in efficacy to Statins. Some of the plants used are abundant or may be easily sourced. With the increasing popularity of food supplements or nutraceuticals, exploration on the potential of plant-based products is attractive.

LSECs are characterized with numerous fenestrae and lack basement membrane as well as a diaphragm. These unique morphological characteristics of LSECs makes them the most permeable endothelial cells of the mammalian vasculature and aid in regulating flow of macromolecules and small lipid-based structures between sinusoidal blood and parenchymal cells. LSECs have a very high endocytic capacity aided by scavenger receptors (SR), such as SR-A, SR-B (SR-B1 and CD-36), SR-E (Lox-1 and mannose receptors), and SR-H (Stabilins). Other high-affinity receptors for mediating endocytosis include the FcRIIb, which assist in the antibody-mediated removal of immune complexes. Complemented with intense lysosomal activity, LSECs play a vital role in the uptake and degradation of many blood borne waste macromolecules and small (<280 nm) colloids. Currently, seven Toll-like receptors have been investigated in LSECs, which are involved in the recognition and clearance of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) as well as damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Along with other SRs, LSECs play an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), in juxtaposition with hepatocytes. LSECs co-express two surface lectins called L-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 Grabbing Non-integrin Receptor (L-SIGN) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin). LSECs also express several adhesion molecules which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Here, we review these cell surface receptors as well as other components expressed by LSECs and their functions in the maintenance of liver homeostasis.

Moreover, infectious diagnoses commonly arising from communicable respiratory pathogens (hierarchical cluster 1 C highly impacted diagnoses) were significantly decreased, with a rate ratio (RR) of 0.35 (95% CI = 0.30-0.40, p < 0.001) after the introduction of public health interventions in April 2020 through December 2020, whereas infections typically arising from the patients own flora (hierarchical cluster 3 C minimally impacted diagnoses) did not demonstrate a sustained change in incidence (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90-1.01, p = 0.085) Conclusions Public health measures to curtail the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 were widely effective against other communicable respiratory infectious diseases with similar modes of transmission but had little effect on infectious diseases not strongly dependent on person-to-person transmission.","output":"The collapse of infectious disease diagnoses commonly due to communicable respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic: A time series and hierarchical clustering analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the prospects of using directive explanations to assist people in achieving recourse of machine learning decisions. Directive explanations list which specific actions an individual needs to take to achieve their desired outcome. If a machine learning model makes a decision that is detrimental to an individual (e.g. denying a loan application), then it needs to both explain why it made that decision and also explain how the individual could obtain their desired outcome (if possible). At present, this is often done using counterfactual explanations, but such explanations generally do not tell individuals how to act. We assert that counterfactual explanations can be improved by explicitly providing people with actions they could use to achieve their desired goal. This paper makes two contributions. First, we present the results of an online study investigating people's perception of directive explanations. Second, we propose a conceptual model to generate such explanations. Our online study showed a significant preference for directive explanations ($p<0.001$). However, the participants' preferred explanation type was affected by multiple factors, such as individual preferences, social factors, and the feasibility of the directives.

It often involves the resection of several pelvic organs and can be associated with a high morbidity and impact on the patients quality of life. The development of better diagnostics, improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, combined with advanced surgical strategies have improved surgical and survival outcomes. This article highlights current and future management options. ABSTRACT: Pelvic exenteration is a complex operation performed for locally advanced and recurrent pelvic cancers. The goal of surgery is to achieve clear margins, therefore identifying adjacent or involved organs, bone, muscle, nerves and/or vascular structures that may need resection. While these extensive resections are potentially curative, they can be associated with substantial morbidity. Recently, there has been a move to centralize care to specialized units, as this facilitates better multidisciplinary care input. Advancements in pelvic oncology and surgical innovation have redefined the boundaries of pelvic exenterative surgery. Combined with improved neoadjuvant therapies, advances in diagnostics, and better reconstructive techniques have provided quicker recovery and better quality of life outcomes, with improved survival This article provides highlights of the current management of advanced pelvic cancers in terms of surgical strategy and potential future developments.","output":"Contemporary Management of Locally Advanced and Recurrent Rectal Cancer: Views from the PelvEx Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first complete parenteral antiretroviral (ART) regimen for treatment of people living with HIV (PLWH). As a monthly intramuscular (IM) injection, this therapy constitutes a major departure from the traditional paradigm of oral therapy requiring (at least) daily administration that has defined HIV treatment for decades. Composed of a second-generation integrase inhibitor (INSTI) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), CAB/RPV has achieved high rates of sustained virologic suppression with a favorable safety profile for treatment-experienced PLWH following oral lead-in (OLI) during several clinical trials.

This article describes the implementation of centralized nationwide mailed HIV/STI home testing (CareKit). METHODS: The Emory Center for AIDS Research developed CareKit for research study participants to request HIV self-test kits, STI specimen collection kits, and condom/lubricant packs to be shipped to any mailing address in the United States. Sexually transmitted infection kits were customized according to study needs and could include materials to collect whole blood, dried blood spots, urine sample, and rectal and pharyngeal swab samples for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing. Specimens were mailed back to a central Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory for testing, and results were returned to participants. RESULTS: CareKit was used by 12 MSM studies and mailed 1132 STI kits to 775 participants between January 2018 and March 2020. Participants returned 507 (45%) STI kits, which included 1594 individual specimens. Eighty-one kits (16%) had at least one positive STI test result: pharyngeal chlamydia (n = 7), pharyngeal gonorrhea (n = 11), rectal chlamydia (n = 15), rectal gonorrhea (n = 12), genital chlamydia (n = 6), genital gonorrhea (n = 1), and syphilis (n = 54). In this same 2-year period, 741 HIV self-test kits were mailed to 643 MSM. CONCLUSIONS: CareKit successfully met studies' needs for home HIV/STI testing and diagnosed many STIs. These processes continue to be adapted for research and programs. The ability to mail home test kits has become increasingly important to reach those who may have limited access to health care services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Scaling Up CareKit: Lessons Learned from Expansion of a Centralized Home HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two datasets were obtained to develop an understanding of factors characterizing the eLearning experience of secondary school teachers and university undergraduate students in Jordan.

However, cramped camps with an unreliable supply of safe water and weak sanitation systems are the ideal setting for major disease outbreaks of all kinds. The Early Warning, Alert and Response Network (EWARN) has been supported by the WHO since the late 1990s to ensure health system capacity to identify and control risks early before they become major epidemics. These systems have been proven to be an excellent asset in reducing morbidity and mortality in humanitarian crises around the world. However, there is also a global challenge of transitioning them back to a regular or national monitoring system in their respective countries. This article is the result of in-country consultations arranged by the Eastern Mediterranean office of the World Health Organization. In these consultations, the unique local conditions and limitations of different countries were discussed to identify a way forward for transitioning these emergency disease surveillance systems into regular systems. After these discussions, different options were presented which could be further modified according to local needs. As there has not been any documented evidence of a successful transition of any emergency surveillance system, it is difficult to discuss or determine the gold standard for transition. As with any public health program being practiced in the field, local decision-making with some broad guidelines will be the best approach available.

In Experiment 1, participants detected tactile stimulations on their forearm, preceded by tactile or non-tactile verbs by one of three delays (170, 350, 500 ms) reflecting different word processing stages. Results revealed shorter reaction times to tactile stimulations following tactile than non-tactile verbs, irrespective of delay. To ensure that priming pertained to tactile, and not motor, verb properties, Experiment 2 compared the impact of tactile verbs to both action and non-tactile verbs, while stimulations were delivered on the index finger. No priming emerged following action verbs, therefore not supporting the motor-grounded interpretation. Facilitation by tactile verbs was however not observed, possibly owing to methodological changes. Experiment 3, identical to Experiment 2 except that stimulation was delivered to participants' forearm, replicated the priming effect. Importantly, tactile stimulations were detected faster after tactile than after both non-tactile and action verbs, indicating that verbs' tactile properties engaged resources shared with sensory perception.

Since then, it has becoming increasingly clear that physical distancing will need to be prolonged in the 2020/2021 school year and possibly resumed in the future. In response, education ministries shifted teaching and learning online. Research is urgently needed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on teaching and learning, particularly in the foundational early primary years. This research directly responds to this concern by examining the unique challenges associated with remote teaching and learning in early primary contexts.

However, the effect of SSS mobility on mental health among ASR has been underexplored so far. METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study among a random sample of 560 adult ASR living in 64 collective accommodation centres in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. SSS in the country of origin before emigration and in Germany was assessed with a multi-lingual, adapted version of the MacArthur social ladder. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured as mental health outcomes. Generalized linear regression models were fitted to estimate associations between changes in SSS and each outcome. RESULTS: A perceived loss of three or more steps in SSS from origin to Germany (compared to no change) was associated with poorer scores in HRQoL (B, standardized coefficient = -2.679, standard error, se = 1.351, p = 0.047), with more depressive symptoms (B = 1.156, se = 0.389, p = 0.003) and anxiety (B = 0.971, se = 0.432, p = 0.025), in models adjusted for SSS in country of origin.

In this study, we performed mutational analysis of the protein coding genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n=2000) collected during January 2021 to March 2021. Our data revealed the emergence of a new variant in West Bengal, India, which is characterized by the presence of 11 co-existing mutations including D614G, P681H and V1230L in S-glycoprotein. This new variant was identified in 70 out of 412 sequences submitted from West Bengal. Interestingly, among these 70 sequences, 16 sequences also harbored E484K in the S glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strains of this new variant emerged from GR clade (B.1.1) and formed a new cluster. We propose to name this variant as GRL or lineage B.1.1/S:V1230L due to the presence of V1230L in S glycoprotein along with GR clade specific mutations. Co-occurrence of P681H, previously observed in UK variant, and E484K, previously observed in South African variant and California variant, demonstrates the convergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutation. V1230L, present within the transmembrane domain of S2 subunit of S glycoprotein, has not yet been reported from any country. Substitution of valine with more hydrophobic amino acid leucine at position 1230 of the transmembrane domain, having role in S protein binding to the viral envelope, could strengthen the interaction of S protein with the viral envelope and also increase the deposition of S protein to the viral envelope, and thus positively regulate virus infection. P618H and E484K mutation have already been demonstrated in favor of increased infectivity and immune invasion respectively. Therefore, the new variant having G614G, P618H, P1230L and E484K is expected to have better infectivity, transmissibility and immune invasion characteristics, which may pose additional threat along with B.1.617 in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in India.","output":"Emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant from GR clade with a novel S glycoprotein mutation V1230L in West Bengal, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online misinformation is a fiendish problem.

They are present everywhere in plants, algae, bacteria whom they protect against free radicals and oxidative stress. Through the consumption of fruits and vegetables and some carotenoid-containing fish, they are introduced into the human body and, similarly, protect it. There are numerous health benefits associated with the consumption of carotenoids. Carotenoids are antioxidants but at the same time they are prone to oxidation themselves. Electron loss from the carotenoid forms a radical cation. Furthermore, proton loss from a radical cation forms a neutral radical. In this mini-review, we discuss carotenoid radicals studied in our groups by various physicochemical methods, namely the radical cations formed by electron transfer and neutral radicals formed by proton loss from the radical cations. They contain many similar hyperfine couplings due to interactions between the electron spin and numerous protons in the carotenoid. Different EPR and ENDOR methods in combination with DFT calculations have been used to distinguish the two independent carotenoid radical species. DFT predicted larger coupling constants for the neutral radical compared to the radical cation. Previously, INDO calculations miss assigned the large couplings to the radical cation. EPR and ENDOR have aided in elucidating the physisorb, electron and proton transfer processes that occur when carotenoids are adsorbed on solid artificial matrices, and predicted similar reactions in aqueous solution or in plants. After years of study of the physicochemical properties of carotenoid radicals, the different published results start to merge together for a better understanding of carotenoid radical species and their implication in biological systems. Up until 2008, the radical chemistry in artificial systems was elucidated but the correlation between quenching ability and neutral radical formation was an inspiration to look for these radical species in vivo.

Less than 9% of the African population is serviced by an emergency medical services transportation system, and nearly two-thirds of African countries do not have any known EMS system in place. One of the leading reasons for EMS utilization in Africa is for obstetric emergencies. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a qualitative description and summation of previously described interventions to improve access to care for patients with maternal obstetric emergencies in Africa with the intent of identifying interventions that can innovatively be translated to a broader emergency context. METHODS The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) under the number CRD42018105371. We searched the following electronic databases for all abstracts up to 10/19/2020 in accordance to PRISMA guidelines: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and African Index Medicus. Articles were included if they were focused on a specific mode of transportation or an access-to-care solution for hospital or outpatient clinic care in Africa for maternal or traumatic emergency conditions. Exclusion criteria included in-hospital solutions intended to address a lack of access. Reference and citation analyses were performed, and a data quality assessment was conducted. Data analysis was performed using a qualitative metasynthesis approach. FINDINGS A total of 6,457 references were imported for screening and 1,757 duplicates were removed. Of the 4,700 studies that were screened against title and abstract, 4,485 studies were excluded. Finally, 215 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility and 152 studies were excluded. A final count of 63 studies were included in the systematic review. In the 63 studies that were included, there was representation from 20 countries in Africa. The three most common interventions included specific transportation solutions (n = 39), community engagement (n = 28) and education or training initiatives (n = 27). Over half of the studies included more than one category of intervention. INTERPRETATION Emergency care systems across Africa are understudied and interventions to improve access to care for obstetric emergencies provides important insight into existing solutions for other types of emergency conditions. Physical access to means of transportation, efforts to increase layperson knowledge and recognition of emergent conditions, and community engagement hold the most promise for future efforts at improving emergency access to care.","output":"Access to care solutions in healthcare for obstetric care in Africa: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The authors conducted a systematic review of the published literature to identify interventions to prevent and/or reduce burnout among medical students and residents. METHODS The authors searched 10 databases (from the start of each through September 21, 2016) using keywords related to burnout, medical education, and prevention. Teams of two authors independently reviewed the search results to select peer-reviewed, English language articles describing educational interventions to prevent and/or reduce burnout among medical students and/or residents that were evaluated using validated burnout measures. They assessed study quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and all used the Maslach Burnout Inventory as at least one measure of burnout. Four were single group pre-post studies, 6 non-randomized two-group studies, and 4 randomized controlled trials. None of the studies were designed specifically to target burnout prevention. In 12 studies, residents were the targeted learners. Six of the 14 studies reported statistically significant changes in burnout scores: 5 reported improvement and 1 reported worsening of burnout. Of the 5 studies that reported statistically significant benefit, 1 studied a complementary and alternative medicine elective, 1 studied the Respiratory One Meditation method, and 3 studied duty hour changes.

Impaired functional connectivity is always correlated with abnormal white matter fibers. Herein, we used multimodal imaging techniques to explore the changes in brain functional and structural connectivity in MMD patients. METHODS: We collected structural images, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging for each subject. Cognitive functions of MMD patients were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Trail Making Test parts A and B (TMT-A/-B). We calculated the functional connectivity for every paired region using 90 regions of interest from the Anatomical Automatic Labeling Atlas and then determined the differences between MMD patients and HCs. We extracted the functional connectivity of paired brain regions with significant differences between the two groups. Correlation analyses were then performed between the functional connectivity and variable cognitive functions. To explore whether the impaired functional connectivity and cognitive performances were attributed to the destruction of white matter fibers, we further analyzed fiber integrity using tractography between paired regions that were correlated with cognition. RESULTS: There was lower functional connectivity in MMD patients as compared to HCs between the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, between the bilateral supramarginal gyrus, between the left supplementary motor area (SMA) and the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFGorb), and between the left SMA and the left middle temporal gyrus (P < 0.01, FDR corrected). The decreased functional connectivity between the left SMA and the left IFGorb was significantly correlated with the MMSE (r = 0.52, P = 0.024), MoCA (r = 0.60, P = 0.006), and TMT-B (r = -0.54, P = 0.048) in MMD patients. White matter fibers were also injured between the SMA and IFGorb in the left hemisphere and were positively correlated with reduced functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Brain functional and structural connectivity between the supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere are damaged in MMD. These findings could be useful in the evaluation of disease progression and prognosis of MMD.

However, the long-term impact after recovery, which is critical to advance our understanding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-associated long-term complications, remains largely unknown. Herein, we characterized multi-omic single-cell profiles of circulating immune cells in the peripheral blood of 100 patients, including covenlesent COVID-19 and sero-negative controls. The reduced frequencies of both short-lived monocytes and long-lived regulatory T (Treg) cells are significantly associated with the patients recovered from severe COVID-19. Consistently, sc-RNA seq analysis reveals seven heterogeneous clusters of monocytes (M0-M6) and ten Treg clusters (T0-T9) featuring distinct molecular signatures and associated with COVID-19 severity. Asymptomatic patients contain the most abundant clusters of monocyte and Treg expressing high CD74 or IFN-responsive genes. In contrast, the patients recovered from a severe disease have shown two dominant inflammatory monocyte clusters with S100 family genes: S100A8 & A9 with high HLA-I whereas S100A4 & A6 with high HLA-II genes, a specific non-classical monocyte cluster with distinct IFITM family genes, and a unique TGF- high Treg Cluster. The outpatients and seronegative controls share most of the monocyte and Treg clusters patterns with high expression of HLA genes. Surprisingly, while presumably short-ived monocytes appear to have sustained alterations over 4 months, the decreased frequencies of long-lived Tregs (high HLA-DRA and S100A6) in the outpatients restore over the tested convalescent time (>= 4 months).

As the border between wildlife and the urban population continue to shrink, it is highly likely that zoonotic viruses may emerge more frequently.

Then, we utilize SARS-CoV-2 as a case study to highlight the methods used to identify the mechanisms of innate immune evasion, and pinpoint the shortcomings in the current paradigm with its focus on overexpression and protein-protein interactions.

Additionally, being ED a clinical marker and predictor of non-communicable chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular, subjects with ED could potentially have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID-19 and to measure the association of COVID-19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. A matching sample of COVID-19-negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID-positive; 75 COVID-negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027). Logistic regression models confirmed a significant effect of COVID-19 on the development of ED, independently of other variables affecting erectile function, such as psychological status, age, and BMI [OR 5.66, 95% CI: 1.50-24.01]. Likewise, subjects with ED were more likely to have COVID-19, once corrected for age and BMI [OR 5.27, 95% CI: 1.49-20.09]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: On top of well-described pathophysiological mechanisms, there is preliminary evidence in a real-life population of ED as a risk factor of developing COVID-19 and possibly occurring as a consequence of COVID-19.

Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. RESULTS: Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general.

In our study, comprehensive computational approaches were applied to identify potential compounds targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. To study the binding affinity and stability of the phytocompounds from Phyllanthus emblica and Aegel marmelos within the defined binding site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, they were subjected to molecular docking, 100ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation followed by post-simulation analysis.

These measures were gathered, formalized, parameterized, and coded and integrated into a digital tool. Design/methodology/approach: To demonstrate the research's approach, a simple design problem was designed, explored, and the results were evaluated. The researchers assumed an empty open office space, with the windows and doors (as exits and/or as access to amenities) already in place (Figure 1). The aim is to optimize the space planning, with the following objectives in mind: maximize the number of employees in a floor while maintaining physical distancing recommendations for avoiding infections;no face-to-face or back-to-back seating positions are allowed;maximize physical access to windows for natural ventilation;minimizing areas with potential congestions in the space, i.e. areas susceptible to overlapping foot traffic from numerous employees, which increases the potential for close encounters and minimizing the travel distance from the employee's desk to all neighbouring desks, hence reducing the foot traffic in the space. In the experiment, the following was assumed: the workspace layout is rectangular, the workstation desks are rectangular, the seating area, windows, and access to exits and amenities are well-defined. Findings: It was found that configurations with desks parallel to the longer side of the space provided more employee capacity;however, they usually performed poorer in terms of the buzz score. On the other hand, configurations with desks perpendicular to the longer side of the space had, on average, better buzz scores, usually at the cost of the reduction of the number of potential employees. There was however one alternative in the latter set of configurations, which achieved above-average buzz and adjacency scores, and the potential to accommodate 56 employees, one of the highest capacities for employees in the solution space (the highest being 60). Designers could explore the design space further to make sure it complies with these basic spatial rules for mitigating the spread of infections, while experimenting with the workspace layout. Research limitations/implications: It is important to note that in order for a designer to handle any given design problem even with the aid of a computer system, it is important to provide a set of initial conditions and assumptions and a set of variables. In the universe of all possible variables, the designer can pick a number of variations of the initial conditions and run parallel experiments to compare their outcomes. In the experiment demonstrated here the following was assumed. The workspace layout is rectangular with predefined entrances/exits. Free flow of employees is allowed. No pre-set one-way paths. The workstation desks are rectangular. The seating area windows and access to amenities are well-defined. Originality/value: This research presented a digital optimization approach to enhance the spatial planning process in open-plan office spaces, with the aim of mitigating the risks of infectious diseases' transmission. Spatial design considerations were gathered from literature and formalized as design objectives and constraints, then further parameterized and represented as numerical values and scores for objective evaluation. The design parameters, constraints and calculations to derive the scores for the designated design objectives were coded into a digital tool that can receive a building information model (BIM) model of an office space and provide preliminary furniture plans using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach. It is obvious that the furniture layouts that can be considered acceptable, based on this approach, are not considered ready-to-implement solutions, because designers need to integrate a multitude of other design factors in their design. This approach can still, however, be useful to help the designer integrate spatial considerations for slowing down a contagion. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Against a workplace contagion: a digital approach to support hygiene-conscious office space planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to assess the risk of central lineCassociated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) of ultrasound (US)-guided cannulation of the brachiocephalic vein (BCV) compared to standard epicutaneous cava catheters (ECCs) in preterm infants.

Findings: The conceptual paper explores an holistic perspective towards pedagogy that considers issues of knowledge, spirituality, self-awareness and embodied actions. Originality/value: This studys intention is to extend our notion of pedagogy that looks beyond educational institutions in seeking a wider understanding of humanity and nature. The concept of pedagogy of life beyond extinction is used as a way to identify a selfless way in life that is underpinned by self-awareness. This provides a lens to intrinsic and extrinsic values that come from an interpretation of truth in our existence beyond self-interest.","output":"Pedagogy of life beyond extinction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Early research showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive but not specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this is a rapidly developing field and these findings need to be re-evaluated in the light of new research. This is the first update of this 'living systematic review'. This update focuses on people suspected of having COVID-19 and excludes studies with only confirmed COVID-19 participants. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 22 June 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19, and which reported estimates of test accuracy, or provided data from which estimates could be computed. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we retained the classification of participants as COVID-19 positive or negative as used in the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list independently, in duplicate. We categorised included studies into three groups based on classification of index test results: studies that reported specific criteria for index test positivity (group 1); studies that did not report specific criteria, but had the test reader(s) explicitly classify the imaging test result as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 2); and studies that reported an overview of index test findings, without explicitly classifying the imaging test as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 3). We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 34 studies: 30 were cross-sectional studies with 8491 participants suspected of COVID-19, of which 4575 (54%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19; four were case-control studies with 848 cases and controls in total, of which 464 (55%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT was evaluated in 31 studies (8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases), chest X-ray in three studies (1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases), and ultrasound of the lungs in one study (100 participants, 31 (31%) cases). Twenty-six per cent (9/34) of all studies were available only as preprints. Nineteen studies were conducted in Asia, 10 in Europe, four in North America and one in Australia. Sixteen studies included only adults, 15 studies included both adults and children and one included only children. Two studies did not report the ages of participants. Twenty-four studies included inpatients, four studies included outpatients, while the remaining six studies were conducted in unclear settings. The majority of included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias with respect to participant selection, index test, reference standard, and participant flow. For chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants (31 studies, 8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 57.4% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 0% to 96.0%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants was 89.9% (95% CI 85.7 to 92.9) and the pooled specificity was 61.1% (95% CI 42.3 to 77.1). Sensitivity analyses showed that when the studies from China were excluded, the studies from other countries demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. When studies that did not classify index tests as positive or negative for COVID-19 (group 3) were excluded, the remaining studies (groups 1 and 2) demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. Sensitivity analyses limited to cross-sectional studies, or studies where at least two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were conducted if the first was negative, did not substantively alter the accuracy estimates. We did not identify publication status as a source of heterogeneity. For chest X-ray in suspected COVID-19 participants (3 studies, 1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 56.9% to 89.0% and specificity from 11.1% to 88.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound of the lungs in suspected COVID-19 participants (1 study, 100 participants, 31 (31%) cases) were 96.8% and 62.3%, respectively. We could not perform a meta-analysis for chest X-ray or ultrasound due to the limited number of included studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may have limited capability in differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. However, we are limited in our confidence in these results due to the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases should be carefully interpreted. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest on the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for chest CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X-rays and ultrasound; and obtain data to further fulfil secondary objectives (e.g. 'threshold' effects, comparing accuracy estimates across different imaging modalities) to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.","output":"Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antidepressant withdrawal is experienced by about half of people who try to reduce or come off their medication. It can be a debilitating, long lasting process. Many clinicians misdiagnose or minimise symptoms, inadvertently prolonging suffering. Most are unable to help patients safely taper off. There has been little research into the peer support communities that are playing an increasingly important role in helping people withdraw from psychiatric medications. METHODS: To illustrate the growth and activities of Facebook withdrawal groups, we examined 13 such groups. All were raising awareness of, and supporting individuals tapering off, antidepressants and were followed for 13 months. A further three groups were added for the last 5 months of the study. RESULTS: In June 2020, the groups had a total membership of 67,125, of which, 60,261 were in private groups. The increase in membership for the 13 groups over the study period was 28.4%. One group was examined in greater detail. Group membership was 82.5% female, as were 80% of the Administrators and Moderators, all of whom are lay volunteers. Membership was international but dominated (51.2%) by the United States (US). The most common reason for seeking out this group was failed clinician-led tapers. DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in the context of research on the prevalence, duration and severity of antidepressant withdrawal. We question why so many patients seek help in peer-led Facebook groups, rather than relying on the clinicians that prescribed the medications. The withdrawal experiences of tens of thousands of people remain hidden in these groups where they receive support to taper when healthcare services should be responsible. Further research should focus on the methods of support and tapering protocols used in these groups to enable improved, more informed support by clinicians. Support from Governments and healthcare agencies is also needed, internationally, to address this issue.","output":"The role of Facebook groups in the management and raising of awareness of antidepressant withdrawal: is social media filling the void left by health services?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current educational context is facing new educational challenges due to the worldwide proliferation of Covid-19.

In low, or low-middle, income countries the numbers of specialist surgeons, especially urologists, is extremely limited and the time they have to train aspiring urologists is, therefore, restricted as a consequence of the demand for clinical help. Urologists from high-income countries, being more prevalent, can assist with the education, but are limited by the needs of their own careers and the time they have available to educate in a resource poor setting. Bringing surgeons from a low to a high income environment for training is one option to overcome this trainer/trainee imbalance, but is relatively expensive, bureaucratic, and has inherent risks of the individual being lost from their domestic workforce. Short-term medical trips to educate larger numbers of individuals in their home setting is one of a number of different options that has been used to bridge this gap. It has, however, been suggested that such a model is not the most efficient way of perpetuating knowledge and skills in a low-income environment. Urolink has found, however, that when short term trips are used to support a longitudinal commitment to a centre they can be remarkable effective. By helping the expansion of personnel to a critical mass in designated regional hubs, linked to credible local or regional academic institutions, it has been possible to develop sustainable centres that can disseminate training across a wide geographical area. Such a co-operative approach has been used between Urolink and the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, Tanzania, a model that has initiated the evolution of other regional training hubs across east Africa over the last three decades.","output":"Disseminating surgical experience for sustainable benefits - the Urolink experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adrenal insufficiency can arise from a primary adrenal disorder, secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, or by suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone by exogenous glucocorticoid or opioid medications. Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.","output":"Adrenal insufficiency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe nurses' mental health status during the Covid-19 outbreak and to explore the factors that might accentuate the negative consequences on their mental health.

RESULTS: Portuguese nurses presented higher depression, anxiety and stress levels, when compared to the Portuguese general population, during the outbreak. Overall, nurses who did not consider the quantity and quality of personal protective equipment as adequate presented significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a difference in procedural volume and cataract surgery between male and female trainees in the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO). METHODS A longitudinal retrospective review of de-identified surgical RANZCO trainee logbook data from 2008 to 2020 was undertaken. Data from 241 trainee logbooks were analysed for: location of training, gender, date of commencement of training, maternity/paternity leave status, number of surgeries observed, assisted, supervised and unsupervised. Surgical cases were grouped as: 1) all surgical cases; 2) complete cataract cases; 3) partial cataract cases. RESULTS Among 241 trainees (40.7% females), 197 263 procedures were performed. Total surgical volume was 21.1% lower at 4 years for females (median 665.5 vs 843.5;p = 0.036). Completed cataract surgery was 21.5% lower at 18 months (median 87.5 vs 111.5; p = 0.022) and 41.7% lower at 4 years (median 216 vs 369;p < 0.001). Interrupted training was significantly more common in females (30.6% vs 0.7%;p < 0.001). However, linear regression analysis did not identify parental leave or duration as a significant predictor for number of completed cataracts (p = 0.206). Complication rate was not different between males and females(p = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS Female trainees completed 41.7% fewer cataract operations at the end of their training compared to male counterparts with the gap widening between years 1 to 4 of training. The current data demonstrates that female and male RANZCO trainees are not receiving equivalent operating experiences. This article is protected by copyright.

To detect lowly abundant ctDNA molecules based on somatic variants, extremely sensitive sequencing methods are required. Here, we describe a new technique, CyclomicsSeq, which is based on Oxford Nanopore sequencing of concatenated copies of a single DNA molecule. Consensus calling of the DNA copies increased the base-calling accuracy ~60, enabling accurate detection of TP53 mutations at frequencies down to 0.02%.

Acute neurological manifestations of this disease have also started emerging and being recognized around the world and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or thrombotic stroke is becoming one of the major neurological illnesses related to COVID-19. The management of AIS is time-critical and major advances in its management over the recent years, such as bridging thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT), are multidisciplinary activities requiring robust coordination and management in the acute setting. All these advances are severely challenged in the COVID-19 pandemic where severe pressures exist on the clinical resources and logistics required to deliver an effective stroke service. This is further compromised by legal and preventive measures during this pandemic like local lockdowns. Reporting of minor or initial symptoms has also been compromised due to the fear of approaching healthcare settings which are perceived as high-risk zones to catch the infection. The purpose of this document is to highlight these challenges and provide a guiding framework for the management of AIS under three principles: (a) Delivering an effective service, (b) Preventing infections within the healthcare setting, and (c) Optimizing resource utilization.

The primary objective of the study was to validate the COVID-19 Bullying Scale (CBS-11). The second objective was to explore factors associated with COVID-19-related bullying and evaluate the mediating effect of fear and anxiety between knowledge and COVID-19-related bullying. Methods: : A cross-sectional online survey conducted between December 20, 2020, and January 5, 2021, involved 405 Lebanese adults recruited using the snowball sampling technique. The CBS-11, an 11-item tool specially created for this study, was used to measure bullying behaviors towards COVID-19 patients. Results: : All items of CBS-11 converged over a 1-factor solution with an eigenvalue over 1, accounting for a variance of 75.16%. The scale has a high Cronbachs alpha (0.974), indicating excellent reliability. A positive correlation was found between the COVID-19 bullying scale and fear, anxiety, and stigma discrimination. The logistic regression showed that higher fear of COVID-19 (ORa=1.04), a positive attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures and hygiene recommendations (ORa=1.18), higher stigma discrimination scores (ORa=1.09), and having a health professional family member (ORa=2.42) were significantly associated with bullying. Conclusion: Our main findings show that CBS-11 could be an efficient tool to measure bullying behaviors toward COVID-19 patients.

The objective of this study is to investigate the changes of search-engine query patterns to monitor this phenomenon based on the tragic suicide of a young Chinese pop star, Kimi Qiao. Methods: The daily search volume for depression was retrieved from both the Baidu Index (BDI) and the Sina MicroBlog Index (SMI). Besides, the daily BDI for suicide, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, common cold, stomach cancer, and liver cancer were collected for comparison. According to the time of Qiao's suicide, all data were divided into two periods (i.e., Period One from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016 while Period Two ranged from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017). The paired t-test was used to compare the differences in search volumes between two periods. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to estimate correlations between the BDI and SMI for depression. Results: The average BDI for depression, BDI for suicide, and SMI for depression in Period Two were significantly higher than in Period One (p < 0.05). There was a strong positive correlation between the BDI and SMI for depression (r = 0.97, p < 0.001). And no significant difference in BDI for other diseases between the two periods was found.

Searching for novel therapeutic or preventative agents in sepsis, we tested a metabolically robust synthetic analog of 17,18-EEQ (EEQ-A) for its ability to reduce mortality, organ damage, and pro-inflammatory cytokine transcript level in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia, which is closely related to sepsis. Overall survival significantly improved following preventative EEQ-A administration along with decreased transcript level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, the therapeutic protocol was effective in improving survival at 48 hours but insignificant at 72 hours. Histopathological analyses showed significant reductions in hemorrhagic and necrotic damage and infiltration in the liver. In vitro studies with THP-1 and U937 cells showed EEQ-A mediated repression of LPS-induced M1 polarization and enhancement of IL-4-induced M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, EEQ-A attenuated the LPS-induced decline of mitochondrial function in THP-1 cells, as indicated by increased basal respiration and ATP production as well as reduction of the metabolic shift to glycolysis.

In this article, we synthesize existing literature to argue that the mental load is a combination of cognitive and emotional labor and it is this combination that makes the mental work a load. We argue that the way the mental load operates within families and society has three characteristics: (1) it is invisible in that it is enacted internally yet results in a range of unpaid, physical labor;(2) it is boundaryless in that can be brought to work and into leisure and sleep time;and (3) enduring in that it is never complete because it is tied to caring for loved ones which is constant. We also offer some future directions for addressing the problems associated with the mental load. First, questions measuring the mental load should be standard in health and social surveys to better understand the problem. Second, employers should adopt better policies that allow for greater work-life reconciliation to lessen the mental load. Third, caregiving should be vital infrastructure developed and invested in by governments to reduce competing work and care demands that accelerate the deleterious consequences of the mental load.

METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted through WeChat from March 13 to 15, 2020, which included a general data questionnaire and Conners parental assessment questionnaire (PSQ). The questionnaires received from outside of Hubei province were excluded through IP address, and the questionnaires with answer time <150 s were also excluded. The influence of parental work status on the psychological behavior was analyzed in children of different age groups. RESULTS A total of 391 valid questionnaires were collected, there were 207 males (52.9%) and 184 females (47.1%); 91 (23.3%) aged 3 to 6, 183 (46.8%) aged 6 to 10, and 117 (29.9%) aged 10 to 16. Both parents were medical staff in 87 participants(22.3%), one parent was medical staff in 139(35.5%) participants, and no parents were medical staff in 165 (42.2%) participants. In 3-<6 years group, there was no significant difference in the PSQ scores of the children in each factor level (all P>0.05) between children with parents as medical staff and those without. In 6-<10 years group, children with both parents as medical staff had higher hyperactivity-impulse factor score, learning problem factor score and total score than those without parents as medical staff (all P<0.05), while they had higher learning problem factor score than those with one parent as medical staff (P<0.05); the anxiety score of children with one or both parents as medical staff was higher than that of those without parents as medical staff (all P<0.05). In 10 to 16 years group, the behavior problems, learning problems, hyperactivity-impulse, more dynamic index and the total score in children with one parent as medical staff were lower than those with both parents as medical staff or without parents as medical staff (P<0.05 or P<0.01); while there were no significant differences in psychosomatic problems, anxiety factor scores between children with one parent as medical staff and other two groups (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS s During COVID-19 epidemic period, the psychological and behavior status of minor children of Hubei medical staff with different ages shows differences with those without parents as medical staff, particularly in 6-<10 years and 10 to 16 year groups. It is necessary to pay attention to the psychological and behavioral status of children of medical staff in these age groups.","output":"[Psychological and behavior status of minor children of medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While work from home (WFH) becomes the new norm in the COVID-19 pandemic and while small businesses could be more vulnerable in crisis, whether the WFH norm will fade after the stay-at-home mandate ended and whether WFH could be a Schumpeterian creative force that helps small businesses do well in the pandemic is unknown.

Unlike other recent studies that focused on airborne transmission routes, this work addresses aerosol transport and deposition in a human respiratory tract. The contribution therefore conducts a computational study of aerosol deposition in digital replicas of human airways, which include the oral cavity, larynx and tracheobronchial airways down to the 12th generation of branching. Breathing through the oral cavity allows the air with aerosols to directly impact the larynx and tracheobronchial airways and can be viewed as one of the worst cases in terms of inhalation rate and aerosol load. The implemented computational model is based on Lagrangian particle tracking in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes resolved turbulent flow. Within this framework, the effects of different flow rates, particle diameters and lung sizes are investigated to enable new insights into local particle deposition behavior and therefore virus loads among selected age groups. We identify a signicant increase of aerosol deposition in the upper airways and thus a strong reduction of virus load in the lower airways for younger individuals. Based on our findings, we propose a possible relation between the younger age related fluid mechanical protection of the lower lung regions due to the airway size and a reduced risk of developing a severe respiratory illness originating from COVID-19 airborne transmission.","output":"Can CFD establish a connection to a milder COVID-19 disease in younger people?

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the levels of work intention, stress and professionalism of nurses and determine the relationship between nursing work intention and factors in response to COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 362 nurses from COVID-19-devoted hospitals in Iran. A self-administered electronic-based questionnaire was developed and used to determine levels of stress, professionalism, and nursing intention. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to analyze the correlation between nursing intention with respect to stress and professionalism. RESULTS: The overall stress, professionalism, and nursing intention scores were 48.56, 21.46, and 17.83 respectively. There were significant differences in nursing intention scores between gender, marital status, and having training groups (pa??<a??0.05). The regression analysis revealed that nursing intention had a significant relationship with older age (pa??<a??0.001,S.Ea??=a??1.11,Ba??=a??17.02), higher income level (pa??<a??0.001,S.Ea??=a??1.81,Ba??=a??6.98), having previous training (pa??=a??0.008,S.Ea??=a??1.22,Ba??=a??3.27), higher stress level (pa??<a??0.001,S.Ea??=a??2.37,Ba??=a??-21.39), and high professionalism level (pa??<a??0.001,S.Ea??=a??1.16,Ba??=a??11.99).

Maternal morbidity and mortality are global health challenges, and developing countries contribute to most of the maternal deaths. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the extent and associated factors for home delivery in Serbo, Kersa Woreda, Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among the 240 study participants. Data were collected by using systematic sampling technique from July 5 to 26, 2021, via a pretested semistructured questionnaire through face-to-face interview, and analyzed by a statistical package for the social sciences version 23.0. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with the extent of home delivery, and factors associated with the extent of home delivery were declared at a p value <0.05. RESULT: In this study, the extent of home delivery was 28.7%. Identified factors statically associated with home delivery were low monthly income (AOR = 16.7, 95% CI: (2.028C13,83)), only the husband as the decision-maker (AOR = 5.0, 95% CI: (1.252C20.021)), never had a history of ANC follow-up (AOR = 5.7, 95% CI: (2.358C16.3)), poor knowledge toward delivery service (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI: (1.661C5.393)), negative attitude toward delivery service (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: (1.054C4.409)), and large family size (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: (1.187C4,119)). CONCLUSION: When compared to the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016, the prevalence of home delivery among women who gave birth in the last one year was low in this study. The study participants' identified factors that were significantly linked with home delivery were low monthly income, only husband as decision maker, no ANC follow-up, poor knowledge of delivery services, negative attitude toward delivery services, and large family size.

Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-B transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-B, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-B transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.","output":"Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Virions Leads to the Induction of Intracellular Signalling in the Absence of Virus Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This 13-month prospective study aimed to investigate the impact of employees worry about workplace measures against COVID-19 on the onset of major depressive episode (MDE) during repeated COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan.

The onset of MDE during the follow-up was retrospectively measured at the 7th survey, with a self-report scale developed based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.): according to the DSM-IV/DSM-5 criteria. Participants were asked to report the number of workplace measures against COVID-19 in their companies/organizations and their worry about these measures. Multiple logistic regression was conducted of MDE on the number of workplace measures and worry about these, adjusting for demographic and work-related covariates and psychological distress at baseline. Results: Among 968 respondents employed in May 2020, 827 completed the 7th survey in June 2021 (80%). We excluded 75 respondents who reported they had MDE in May 2020 or earlier.

This obesity paradox is predominantly described in reports from the Western Hemisphere during acute illnesses. Since adipose triglyceride composition corresponds to long-term dietary patterns, we performed a meta-analysis modeling the effect of obesity on severity of acute pancreatitis, in the context of dietary patterns of the countries from which the studies originated. Increased severity was noted in leaner populations with a higher proportion of unsaturated fat intake. In mice, greater hydrolysis of unsaturated visceral triglyceride caused worse organ failure during pancreatitis, even when the mice were leaner than those having saturated triglyceride. Saturation interfered with triglycerides interaction and lipolysis by pancreatic triglyceride lipase, which mediates organ failure. Unsaturation increased fatty acid monomers in vivo and aqueous media, resulting in greater lipotoxic cellular responses and organ failure. Therefore, visceral triglyceride saturation reduces the ensuing lipotoxicity despite higher adiposity, thus explaining the obesity paradox.","output":"Adipose saturation reduces lipotoxic systemic inflammation and explains the obesity paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has turned into a pandemic and resulted in huge death tolls and burdens. Integrating Chinese and western medicine has played an important role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE We aimed to develop a living evidence-based guideline of integrating Chinese and western medicine for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN Living evidence-based guideline. METHODS This living guideline was developed using internationally recognized and accepted guideline standards, dynamically monitoring the release of new clinical evidence, and quickly updating the linked living systematic review, evidence summary tables, and recommendations. Modified Delphi method was used to reach consensus for all recommendations. The certainty of the evidence, resources, and other factors were fully considered, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence and the strength of recommendations. RESULTS The first version of this living guidance focuses on patients who are mild or moderate COVID-19. A multidisciplinary guideline development panel was established. Ten clinical questions were identified based on the status of evidence and a face-to-face experts' consensus. Finally, nine recommendations were reached consensus, and were formulated from systematic reviews of the benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, public accessibility, policy supports, feedback on proposed recommendations from multidisciplinary experts, and consensus meetings. CONCLUSION This guideline panel made nine recommendations, which covered five traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription granules/decoction (MXXFJD, QFPD, XFBD, TJQW, and JWDY), three Chinese patent medicines (LHQW granules/capsule, JHQG granules, and LHQK granules), and one Chinese herbal injection (XBJ injection).

The mechanism by which ZIKV infection causes these adverse outcomes and specifically, the interplay between the maternal immune response and ZIKV replication has yet to be fully elucidated. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of transplacental ZIKV transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes, we have previously shown that Asian lineage ZIKV disrupts placental morphology and induces elevated secretion of IL-1. In the current manuscript, we characterized placental damage and inflammation during in utero African lineage ZIKV infection. Within 48 hours after ZIKV infection at embryonic day 10, viral RNA was detected in placentas and fetuses from ZIKA infected dams, which corresponded with placental damage and reduced fetal viability as compared with mock infected dams. Dams infected with ZIKV had reduced proportions of trophoblasts and endothelial cells and disrupted placental morphology compared to mock infected dams. While placental IL-1 was increased in the placenta, but not the spleen, within 3 hours post infection, this was not caused by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Using bulk mRNAseq from placentas of ZIKV and mock infected dams, ZIKV infection caused profound downregulation of the transcriptional activity of genes that may underly tissue morphology, neurological development, metabolism, cell signaling and inflammation, illustrating that in utero ZIKV infections causes disruption of pathways associated with CZS in our model.","output":"Downregulation of transcriptional activity, increased inflammation, and damage in the placenta following in utero Zika virus infection is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has impacted health care, economies and societies in ways that are still being measured across the world.

Similarly, antibodies used to prevent or treat viral infections attach to epitopes on virions or on viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells. Such drugs and antibodies can therefore be thought of as probes for the detection of viral infections, suggesting that they might be used as radiolabeled tracers to visualize sites of viral replication by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A current example of this approach is the PET imaging of herpes simplex virus infections, in which the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates radiolabeled thymidine analogues, trapping them within infected cells. One of many possible future applications might be the use of a radiolabeled hepatitis C protease inhibitor to image infection in animals or humans and provide a quantitative measure of viral burden. This article reviews the basic features of radionuclide imaging and the characteristics of ideal tracer molecules, and discusses how antiviral drugs and antibodies could be evaluated for their suitability as virus-specific imaging probes.

The classical fat-harvesting method in which a 10-cc syringe and a 3.0-mm cannula are used, may be time-consuming when a large quantity of adipose tissue is required. We describe a novel technique to optimize fat harvesting, the vacuum-assisted adipose tissue suction technique (VAST), in which disposable sterile components are used. This study compares the adipose tissue harvesting speed and the adipocyte volume between the VAST and the 10-cc-syringe technique. METHODS From May 2010 to May 2012, a total of 32 patients who had structural fat grafting for breast reconstruction were enrolled in this prospective study. In 16 patients (control group) fat was harvested by the classical 10-cc-syringe technique, and in the other 16 patients (VAST group) fat was harvested by the VAST. Adipose tissue was harvested from the abdomen area in all patients. The volume of harvested adipose tissue was noted every minute during the operative procedure. The operative harvesting speed was calculated for each patient after 5 min. The volume harvested in 5 min was centrifuged, and the remaining adipocyte volume was noted after centrifugation. The operative harvesting speed and the remaining adipocyte rate were compared in both groups. RESULTS The average volume of harvested adipose tissue was 18.1 ml in the control group and 156.2 ml in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average harvesting speed was 3.6 ml/min in the control group using a 10-cc syringe and 31.2 ml/min in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average remaining adipocyte volume, after centrifugation, was 13.5 ml in the control group, and 118.2 ml in the VAST group (p < 0.001). The average remaining adipocyte rate, after centrifugation, was 74.3 % in the control group and 75.4 % in the VAST group (p = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS Adipose tissue harvesting can be optimized safely by using the VAST before structural fat grafting. Its quickness, low cost, and efficiency make us choose this method in breast reconstruction when a significant volume of adipocytes is required.

After a number of patients reported a willingness to try an online group, we trialled a six-week online Mindfulness and Meditation group.Aim(s)To discuss the principles of mindfulness and how it can benefit those living with life-limiting illnesses;deliver tangible experience of mindfulness practice;and provide social connectedness to patients with symptoms of anxiety shielding in their homes.MethodsNovember - December 2020: course scoping and planning;December 2020 - January 2021: patient recruitment;27 January - 3 March 2021: course delivered via presentation slides on Zoom and weekly homework tasks;March - April 2021: evaluation and service user feedback. Outcome measures: number of attendees, service user feedback.ResultsAttendee numbers: 11 patients signed up with between five and eight attending each session. Six patients provided feedback: 100% reported the course helped them a) feel less stressed and overwhelmed, b) change the way they view their thoughts, and c) change their behaviours. 83% were either satisfied or very satisfied with the course.ConclusionsThe online Mindfulness and Meditation group had good and regular attendance, and service users indicated that it contributed to positive changes in their mental health. The course will run online again in July 2021, this time with pre- and post-questionnaires to assess the reduction in symptoms of anxiety more robustly.","output":"Online delivery of mindfulness and meditation psychological support group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renewed COVID-19 outbreaks, stemming from the highly infectious Delta and Omicron variants, prompted rising fears of a pandemic among the unvaccinated. To address this prevalent vaccination crisis, media framing communication strategies can amplify the scientific evidence on COVID-19 vaccines to reach diverse geographic and socio-economic communities. The critical role of media framing strategies to engage and encourage large populations regarding vaccine acceptance has been rarely studied, despite growing evidence on vaccine hesitancy. The present study used a multi-method approach (i.e., content analysis and quasi-experiments) that unpacked the framing practices employed by the mainstream press media in Pakistan. The findings of the content analysis revealed that the media extensively used uncertainty, conflict, consequences, and action rather than new evidence and reassurance frames in its COVID-19 related campaigns. In a series of quasi-experiments involving 720 participants, we manipulated these six frames of COVID-19 related news coverage (i.e., uncertainty, conflict, consequences, action, new evidence, and reassurance) to investigate the underlying mechanism that influences vaccine acceptance. The findings established that the message-consistent effects of media frames manifesting fear (e.g., consequence and uncertainty) and action cues made receivers more supportive of vaccination. The present study findings theoretically address the calls for a more inclusive community-health reporting model, besides offering new evidence on the media framing strategies to deliver more targeted, meaningful, and effective campaigns to raise public acceptance for COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Immunity Debt or Vaccination Crisis?

METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in two hospitals in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients undergoing MI-ILE were included. A Jackson-Pratt drain next to the dorsal side of the anastomosis and bilateral chest drains were placed at the end of the thoracoscopic procedure. Amylase levels in drain fluid were determined in all patients during at least the first four postoperative days. Contrast computed tomography scans and/or endoscopic imaging were performed in cases of a clinically suspected AL. Anastomotic leakage was defined as any sign of leakage of the esophago-gastric anastomosis on endoscopy, re-operation, radiographic investigations, post mortal examination or when gastro-intestinal contents were found in drain fluid. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine the cut-off values. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, risk ratio and overall test accuracy were calculated for elevated drain amylase concentrations. RESULTS A total of 89 patients were included between March 2013 and August 2014. No differences in group characteristics were observed between patients with and without AL, except for age. Patients with AL were older than were patients without AL (P = 0.01). One patient (1.1%) without AL died within 30 d after surgery due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anastomotic leakage that required any intervention occurred in 15 patients (16.9%). Patients with proven anastomotic leakage had higher drain amylase levels than patients without anastomotic leakage [median 384 IU/L (IQR 34-6263) vs median 37 IU/L (IQR 26-66), P = 0.003]. Optimal cut-off values on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 were 350 IU/L, 200 IU/L and 160 IU/L, respectively. An elevated amylase level was found in 9 of the 15 patients with AL. Five of these 9 patients had early elevations of their amylase levels, with a median of 2 d (IQR 2-5) before signs and symptoms occurred. CONCLUSION Measurement of drain amylase levels is an inexpensive and easy tool that may be used to screen for anastomotic leakage soon after MI-ILE. However, clinical validation of this marker is necessary.","output":"Diagnostic value of drain amylase for detecting intrathoracic leakage after esophagectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose/Introduction A Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) was set up at Lille University Hospital in 2016. The purpose of this study was to assess persistence with osteoporosis treatment in patients from the FLS over a period of 1 year, and to determine predictors of discontinuation. METHODS The study population comprised adults of both genders, aged 50 or over, admitted to Lille University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 for a low-trauma fracture and managed in our FLS. Outcomes included (1) persistence rate at 1 year after treatment initiation, (2) persistence rate at 2 years after treatment initiation, (3) persistence rate at 1 and 2 years after treatment initiation according to type of treatment, (4) predictors of non-persistence, and (5) reasons for discontinuing treatment over 1 year after initiation. Persistence was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS In all, 1,224 patients ( 50 years old) with a recent history of low-trauma fracture ( 12 months) were identified. Of these, 380 patients - 79.2% female; mean (SD) age 76 (11) years - were seen at the FLS. In those 380 patients, 410 fractures were found and 360 of them (87.8%) were major fractures, breaking down as follows: vertebra (44%), hip (19%), proximal humerus (10%), and pelvis (8%). Osteoporosis treatment was prescribed for 367 (96.6%) patients and 275 of them began the prescribed treatment. The following anti-osteoporosis drugs were prescribed: zoledronic acid (n=150, 54.5%), teriparatide (n=63, 22.9%), and denosumab (n=39, 14.2%). Oral bisphosphonates were prescribed for a few patients (n=23, 8.4%). Persistence with osteoporosis medication (any class) was estimated at 84.1% (95% CI: 79.1% to 88.1%) at 12-month follow-up, and dropped to 70.3% (95% CI: 63.7% to 75.9%) at 24 months. When drug-specific analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, persistence rates at 12 and 24 months were found to be higher with denosumab than with any other treatment. Independent predictors of non-persistence at 12 months were 'follow-up performed by a general practitioner (GP)' - Odds Ratio (OR) for GP vs. FLS = 3.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 8.90, p=0.004 - and 'treatment with zoledronic acid' - OR for zoledronic acid vs. denosumab = 3.39; 95% CI, 1.21 to 9.50, p=0.019; OR for zoledronic acid vs. teriparatide = 8.86; 95% CI, 1.15 to 68.10, p=0.035.

Serological screening is used to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence, but many questions regarding infection risk and utility of serological testing amongst HCP remain unanswered. To improve this, we initiated the COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) study. Design and setting: The CoCo study is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal, observational study at Hannover Medical School, a large university hospital in Northern Germany and affili-ated care providers. Since March 2020, it monitors anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and collects information on symptoms of infection, work, home and self-perceived infection risk. Participants: More than 1250 male and female HCP are enrolled. Inclusion criteria are (1) working as HCP in clinical care at our university, affiliated hospitals or private practices, (2) written informed consent, (3) age >18 years. Exclusion criteria are (1) refusal to give informed consent, (2) contraindication to venepuncture. Sampling/Intervention: Study participants provide samples weekly to six-monthly (7.5 ml serum and 7.5 ml EDTA blood) and fill out a questionnaire. Sera are screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1 (S1) immunoglobulin G (IgG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive or borderline positive samples are re-assessed with an alternative test. Individual results are made available for each participant online via a dedicated study website. This study also compares different serological testing assays and explores further humoral and cellular immune markers. Study protocols are continually adapted to the evolving situation of the pandemic. Conclusions: This ongoing prospective study aims to answer central questions on the prev-alence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2-humoral immune responses and validity of serologi-cal testing of HCP in a region with comparably high healthcare standards and low COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, our results may be relevant to other regions around the world in man-aging this unprecedented situation.","output":"Protocol for longitudinal assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in healthcare professionals in Hannover, Germa-ny: the prospective, longitudinal, observational COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to spread across the world with increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths. Due to outbreaks of new variants of the virus and limited treatment options, positive perception and good practice of preventive guidelines have remained essential measures for the prevention of the disease and slowing down its transmission. We aimed to study perception towards COVID-19 and the practice of guidelines for preventing the disease among Bangladeshi adults during the early stage of the rapid rise of the outbreak. Methods: Data was collected data from 320 participants. For measuring their level of practice, we asked a general question: Are you properly following the WHO-recommended guidelines to avoid COVID-19? The frequency distribution, Chi-square (2) test and binary logistic regression model were used in this study. Results: The average risk perception among the participants was 3.050.75 (median, 3.00) (95% CI of mean: 2.96-3.13) where the score ranges from 0 (no risk) to 4 (high risk). More than 27% of participants showed high-risk perceptions. Males (p<0.05), high educated (p<0.05), rich (p<0.01), service holders (p<0.05), and younger adults (p<0.05) had higher odds of high-risk perception. More than 71% of participants had a good practice of always following the WHO guidelines to prevent COVID-19 and living locations in urban areas (p<0.01), high education (p<0.01), rich (p<0.01), and joint family (p<0.01) had the most contributions to good practice.

Sialic acids are a group of nine-carbon acidic &#945;-keto sugars, usually located at the end of glycans of cell surface glycoconjugates and serve as attachment sites for previous HCoVs. It is therefore speculated that sialic acids on the host cell surface could serve as co-receptors or attachment factors for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry as well. Recent in-silico modeling, molecular modeling predictions and microscopy studies indicate potential sialic acid-binding by SARS-CoV-2 upon cell entry. In particular, a flat sialic acid-binding domain was proposed at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein, which may lead to the initial contact and interaction of the virus on the epithelium followed by higher affinity binding to ACE2 receptor, likely a two-step attachment fashion. However, recent in vitro and ex vivo studies of sialic acids on ACE2 receptor confirmed an opposite role for SARS-CoV-2 binding. In particular, neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells and ACE2-expressing 293 T cells increased SARS-CoV-2 binding. Further, the ACE2 glycosylation mutants indicate that sialic acids on ACE2 receptor prevent ACE2-spike protein interaction. On the other hand, a most recent study indicates that gangliosides could serve as ligands for receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

RNA structure determination is thus a vital step towards understanding its function. The secondary structure of RNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotide base pairs and it defines the positions and shapes of functional stem-loops, internal loops, bulges, and other functional and structural elements. In this work we present a methodology for studying large intact RNA biomolecules using homonuclear 15N solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that Proton Driven Spin Diffusion (PDSD) experiments with long mixing times, up to 16s, improved by the incorporation of multiple rotor-synchronous 1H inversion pulses (termed Radiofrequency Dipolar Recoupling, RFDR, pulses), reveal key hydrogen-bond contacts. In the full-length RNA isolated from MS2 phage, we observed strong and dominant contributions of G-C Watson-Crick base pairs, and beyond these common interactions, we observe a significant contribution of the G-U wobble base pairs. Moreover, we can differentiate base-paired and non-base-paired nitrogen atoms. Using the improved technique facilitates characterization of hydrogen-bond types in intact large-scale RNA using solid-state NMR.

The Melbourne Rapid Fields screening module (MRF-S) is an iPad-based test, which allows suprathreshold screening with zone-based analysis to rapidly assess the risk of manifest glaucoma. The versatility of MRF-S has potential utility in rural areas and during infectious pandemics. This study evaluates the utility of MRF-S for detecting field defects in non-metropolitan settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional validation study. Two hundred and fifty-two eyes of 142 participants were recruited from rural sites through two outreach eye services in Australia. Participants were tested using MRF-S and compared with a reference standard; either Zeiss Humphrey Field Analyzer or Haag-Streit Octopus performed at the same visit. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess user acceptability. Major outcome measures were the area under the curve (AUC) for detecting mild and moderate field defects defined by the reference tests, along with corresponding performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: The mean test duration for MRF-S was 1.88 minutes compared with 5.92 minutes for reference tests. The AUCs for mild and moderate field defects were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75C0.87] and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83C0.92), respectively, indicating very good diagnostic accuracy. Using a risk criterion of 55%, MRF-S identified moderate field defects with a sensitivity and specificity of 88.4 and 81.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The MRF-S iPad module can identify patients with mild and moderate field defects while delivering favorable user acceptability and short test duration.

Pakistan is one of these countries. A government mandated lockdown can have mitigating psychological effects on young adults, out of which a large fraction is made up of students. This study aims to investigate the correlations between changes in sleep pattern, perception of time, and digital media usage. Furthermore, it explores the impact of these changes on the mental health of students of different educational levels. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire, from March 24 to April 26, 2020. The survey was targeted at students and 251 responses were obtained. It was a 5-section long questionnaire. The first section inquired about demographics of participants. Each of the other 4 section were devoted to changes in sleep pattern, perception of time flow, digital media usage and mental health status of students. Close ended questions with multiple choice responses, dichotomous, interval and 4-point Likert scales were used in the construction of the survey questionnaire. Chi square, T-tests multinomial and binary logistic regression were used as primary statistical tests. All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Out of 251 adolescents that participated in our study, the majority (70.2%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 19.40+/- 1.62 years. Two-thirds of the respondents did not have much trouble falling asleep (66.5%). The analysis found no significant association between longer sleep periods and procrastination level (p = 0.054). Nearly three-fourths (72.9%) of our participants felt that getting through quarantine would have been more difficult if they did not have any electronic gadgets. Of these, a majority (85.8%) had a general feeling of tiredness and lacked motivation (p = 0.023). Additionally, a large number of students (69.7%) had reported that time is seemingly moving faster. A significant relationship between increased usage of electronic items and longer sleep periods was also noted (p = 0.005). With respect to the level of education statistically significant values were noted for alarm use both before and after quarantine began (p = 0.021 and p = 0.004, respectively). Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the median difference of time spent on social media before the outbreak (3.0+/-32.46) and time spent on social media after the outbreak (6.0+/-3.52) in a single day (p=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Our research has revealed that due to the lockdown imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, the sleeping patterns of the students was affected the most. Our findings show that the increase in use of social media applications led to a widespread increase in the length of sleep, worsening of sleep habits (people sleeping at much later hours than usual), and a general feeling of tiredness. A general lack of recollection regarding what day of the week it was, as well as a change in the perceived flow of time were also notable. All these findings indicate the decline in mental health of students due to the lockdown. Promoting better sleep routines, minimizing the use of digital media, and encouragement of students to take up more hobbies could collectively improve the health and mood of students in self quarantine.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on lifestyle and mental health of students: A retrospective study from Karachi,Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still effective all over the world.

Patients with severe infection had significantly higher ferritin (median 1163.0 vs 624.0 ng/mL, p < 0.01), procalcitonin (median 0.8 vs 0.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01), and C-reactive protein (median 142.0 vs 62.3 mg/L, p = 0.02) levels compared to those with moderate infection. White blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine were also associated with severe infection. D-dimer levels were not significantly associated with severe infection (p = 0.20).

Given the need for context-appropriate interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the Diabetes: Community-led Awareness, Response and Evaluation (D:Clare) trial will rigorously evaluate the replication and scale-up of a participatory learning and action (PLA) cycle intervention in Bangladesh, to inform policy on population-level T2DM prevention and control. METHODS: This is a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, with integrated process and economic evaluations, conducted from March 2020 to September 2022. The trial will evaluate a community-based four-phase PLA cycle intervention focused on prevention and control of T2DM implemented over 18 months, against a control of usual care. Twelve clusters will be randomly allocated (1:1) to implement the intervention at project month 1 or 12. The intervention will be evaluated through three cross-sectional surveys at months 1, 12 and 24. The trial will be conducted in Alfadanga Upazila, Faridpur district, with an estimated population of 120,000. Clusters are defined as administrative geographical areas, with approximately equal populations. Each of the six unions in Alfadanga will be divided into two clusters, forming 12 clusters in total. Given the risk of inter-cluster contamination, evaluation surveys will exclude villages in border areas. Participants will be randomly sampled, independently for each survey, from a population census conducted in January 2020. The primary outcome is the combined prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM, measured through fasting and 2-h post-glucose load blood tests. A total of 4680 participants provide 84% power to detect a 30% reduction in the primary outcome, assuming a baseline of 30% and an ICC of 0.07. The analysis will be by intention-to-treat, comparing intervention and control periods across all clusters, adjusting for geographical clustering. DISCUSSION: This study will provide further evidence of effectiveness for community-based PLA to prevent T2DM at scale in a rural Bangladesh setting. However, we encountered several challenges in applying the stepped-wedge design to our research context, with particular consideration given to balancing seasonality, timing and number of steps and estimation of partial versus full effect.

METHODS: The authors designed a retrospective cohort study enrolling subjects who presented to an urban Level 1 trauma center in Seattle, WA, for the evaluation and management of OMT between January 1 and December 31 in the years 2018 through 2020. The primary predictor variable was evaluation of OMT during periods with (2020: investigational group) or without (2018 or 2019: control group) social distancing policies in place. The primary outcome variables were the mechanism and severity of injury, defined as IPV, DV or neither, the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) and the injury severity score (ISS). Descriptive, univariate and bivariate analyses were performed with statistical significance at P < .05. RESULTS: Eight hundred twenty-eight subjects; 737 (89%) IPV and 91(11%) IPV due to DV. The incidence of OMT secondary to IPV or DV was unchanged (Pa?=a?.81, Pa?=a?.57 respectively). There was a nonsignificant increase in ISS for IPV (Pa?=a?.07) and no change for DV (Pa?=a?.46). AIS scores were unchanged for IPV (Pa?=a?.36). For DV, AIS scores were lower in 2020 when compared to 2019 (Pa?=a?.04) but unchanged from 2018 (Pa?=a?.58). At least half of the DV victims were male (50% in 2018, 59% in 2019, and 53% in 2020). Of these, 65% were under 18, and represented the pediatric majority (62%).

As a nucleocytoplasmic DNA virus, Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) causes high economic losses in the mariculture industry. Aptamer-Q5-complexed major capsid protein (MCP) in the membrane of SGIV-infected cells can be used as a specific molecular probe to investigate the crucial events of MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected host cells during viral infection. Chlorpromazine blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected cells decreased significantly when the cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine. The disruption of cellular cholesterol by methyl--cyclodextrin also significantly reduced MCP endocytosis. In contrast, inhibitors of key regulators of caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, including genistein, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), myosin II, Rac1 GTPase, and protein kinase C (PKC), had no effect on MCP endocytosis. The endocytosis of the biomarker MCP is dependent on low pH and cytoskeletal actin filaments, as shown with various inhibitors (chloroquine, ammonia chloride, cytochalasin D). Therefore, MCP enters SGIV-infected host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is dependent on dynamin, cholesterol, low pH, and cytoskeletal actin filaments. This is the first report of a specific aptamer-based probe used to analyze MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected host cells during viral infection.

The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society coronavirus disease 2019 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box (median (IQR [range]) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6])s vs. 82.1 (45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0])s p = 0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4 (43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2])s, p = 0.008).

However, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) is mainly limited to the analysis of imaging artifacts, such as B-lines, which correlate with a wide variety of diseases. Therefore, the results of LUS investigations remain qualitative and subjective, and specificity is obviously suboptimal. Focusing on the development of a quantitative method dedicated to the lung, in this work we present the first clinical results obtained with Quantitative LUS Spectroscopy when applied to the differentiation of pulmonary fibrosis. A previously-developed specific multi-frequency ultrasound imaging technique was utilized to acquire ultrasound images from 26 selected patients. The multi-frequency imaging technique was implemented on the ULA-OP platform, and a LA533? (Esaote, Florence, Italy) linear-array probe was utilized. RF-data obtained at different imaging frequencies (3, 4, 5 and 6 MHz) were acquired and processed in order to characterize B-lines based on their frequency content. In particular, B-line native frequencies (the frequency at which a B-line exhibits the highest intensity) and bandwidth (the range of frequencies over which a B-line shows intensities within -6 dB from its highest intensity), as well as B-line intensity, were analyzed. Results show how the analysis of these features allows (in this group of patients) the differentiation of fibrosis with a sensitivity and specificity equal to 92% and 92%, respectively. These promising results strongly motivate towards the extension of the clinical study, aiming at analyzing a larger cohort of patients and including a broader range of pathologies.","output":"Quantitative Lung Ultrasound Spectroscopy applied to the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Fibrosis: first clinical study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As many federal and state governments are starting to ease restrictions on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used to flatten the curve, we developed an agent-based simulation to model the incidence of COVID-19 in King County, WA under several scenarios.

However, more recent data suggests favorable outcomes in COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. We aimed to explore the epidemiology and outcomes of ECMO for COVID-19 related cardiopulmonary failure and evaluate outcomes of new centers versus established ones.Methods: This is a retrospective, multicenter international, observational study conducted in (19) ECMO centers in five countries from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. We included 307 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO for refractory hypoxemia and severe respiratory acidosis with or without circulatory failure. Data collection included Patients characteristics, demographic data, ECMO-related specific data, pre-ECMO patient condition, 24 hours post-ECMO initiation data, and outcome. The primary outcome is survival to home discharge. Secondary outcomes include mortality during ECMO, survival to decannulation, and outcomes stratified by center type in which patients were treated.Findings: Three hundred and seven COVID-19 patients received ECMO support during the study period.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model.

METHODS An ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging device was installed in the internal medicine department specializing in diabetes to obtain fundus images of patients with diabetes. Remote interpretation was conducted at Nagoya City University using a cloud server. The medical data, severity of retinopathy, and frequency of ophthalmologic visits were analyzed. RESULTS Four hundred ninety-nine patients (mean age, 62.5  13.4 years) were included. The duration of diabetes in 240 (48.1%) patients was less than 10 years and 433 (86.7%) patients had a hemoglobin (Hb) A1c below 8%. Regarding the retinopathy severity, 359 (72.1%) patients had no diabetic retinopathy (NDR), 63 (12.6%) mild nonproliferative retinopathy (NPDR), 37 (7.6%) moderate NPDR, 13 (2.6%) severe NPDR, and 27 (5.0%) PDR. Two hundred forty-one (48.3%) patients had an ophthalmologic consultation within 1 year, 104 (20.8%) had no history of an ophthalmologic consultation. DR was not present in 86 (82.7%) patients who had never had an ophthalmologic examination, 32 (80.0%) patients with severe NPDR or PDR had had an ophthalmologic visit within 1 year. The frequency of ophthalmic visits was correlated negatively with age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, and severity of retinopathy. CONCLUSION Remote interpretation of DR using UWF retinal imaging was useful for retinopathy screening. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a remote screening system that can ensure compulsory social distancing and reduce the number of ophthalmic visits can be a safe system for patients and clinicians.","output":"Remote screening of diabetic retinopathy using ultra-widefield retinal imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The urgent drive for vaccine development in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted public and private organisations to invest heavily in research and development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Organisations globally have affirmed the commitment of fair global access, but the means by which a successful vaccine can be mass produced and equitably distributed remains notably unanswered. Barriers for low-income countries include the inability to afford vaccines as well as inadequate resources to vaccinate, barriers that are exacerbated during a pandemic. Fair distribution of a pandemic vaccine is unlikely without a solid ethical framework for allocation.

Methods: The population of the cross-sectional study consists of 289 people who were engaged in nature-oriented outdoor sports activities in the Tunceli region between 28.06.2021 and 20.07.2021. Results: COVID-19 phobia was statistically higher in women, people under 35, singles, those with high school or lower education, and those who do not have children. Although many nature sports activities reduce the phobia of COVID-19, there was especially a statistically significant decrease in COVID-19 phobia among those who engage in rock climbing. Besides, those who practiced outdoor sports with fear of death and quarantine had a statistically higher COVID-19 phobia score. There was a weakly significant negative relationship between the years of experience, the number of types of outdoor sports activities that the individuals engage in, and the COVID-19 phobia score. As the years of experience in these activities and their types increased, the COVID-19 phobia decreased, albeit weakly. Conclusion: Performing nature-oriented outdoor sports activities from different fields can be beneficial, even partially, in reducing the phobia caused by COVID-19. In pandemics, such as COVID-19, which have a wide range of negative effects on society, individuals can be directed to nature sports against COVID-19 phobia.","output":"Reflections of Nature-Oriented Outdoor Sports Activities on Coronavirus-19 Phobia During the Pandemic Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard workflows for analyzing microbiomes often include the creation and curation of phylogenetic trees.

Moreover, we simulated the same scenarios to estimate the concentration of RNA copies in the air through a novel theoretical approach and conducted a comparative analysis between experimental and theoretical results. Results showed that for an infected subject's viral load ranging between 2.4  10(6) and 5.5  10(6) RNA copies mL(-1), the corresponding airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration was below the minimum detection threshold when the person was breathing, and 16.1 (expanded uncertainty of 32.8) RNA copies m(-3) when speaking. The application of the predictive approach provided concentrations metrologically compatible with the available experimental data (i.e. for speaking activity). Thus, the study presented significant evidence to close the gap in understanding airborne transmission, given that the airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration was shown to be directly related to the SARS-CoV-2 emitted.

A. Meyer), a representative Chinese herbal medicine, can improve the bodys antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. Recently, scientists have shifted emphasis towards the initial stages of different malignant diseasescorresponding organ fibrosis and explored the essential role of P. ginseng in the treatment of fibrotic diseases. MAIN BODY: In the first instance, the review generalizes the molecular mechanisms and common therapeutic methods of fibrosis. Next, due to the convenience and safety of individual medication, the research progress of ginseng extract and formulas in treating liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, and renal fibrosis has been systematically summarized. Finally, we describe active ingredients isolated from P. ginseng for their outstanding anti-fibrotic properties and further reveal the potential therapeutic prospect and limitations of P. ginseng in fibrotic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: P. ginseng can be regarded as a valuable herbal medicine against fibrous tissue proliferation. Ginseng extract, derived formulas and monomers can inhibit the abundant deposition of extracellular matrix which caused by repeated damage and provide protection for fibrotic organs. Although the molecular mechanisms such as transforming growth factor  signal transduction have been confirmed, future studies should still focus on exploring the underlying mechanisms of P. ginseng in treating fibrotic disease including the therapeutic targets of synergistic action of multiple components in P. ginseng. Moreover, it is also necessary to carry out clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of P. ginseng in combination with common fibrosis drugs.","output":"Panax ginseng C. A.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 and mortality in Medicare patients undergoing long-term dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, claims-based cohort study compared mortality trends of patients receiving long-term dialysis in 2020 with previous years (2013-2019) and fit Cox regression models to identify risk factors for contracting COVID-19 and postdiagnosis mortality. The cohort included the national population of Medicare patients receiving long-term dialysis in 2020, derived from clinical and administrative databases. COVID-19 was identified through Medicare claims sources. Data were analyzed on May 17, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 2 main outcomes were COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Associations of claims-based risk factors with COVID-19 and mortality were investigated prediagnosis and postdiagnosis. RESULTS: Among a total of 498 169 Medicare patients undergoing dialysis (median [IQR] age, 66 [56-74] years; 215 935 [43.1%] women and 283 227 [56.9%] men), 60 090 (12.1%) had COVID-19, among whom 15 612 patients (26.0%) died. COVID-19 rates were significantly higher among Black (21 787 of 165 830 patients [13.1%]) and Hispanic (13 530 of 86 871 patients [15.6%]) patients compared with non-Black patients (38 303 of 332 339 [11.5%]), as well as patients with short (ie, 1-89 days; 7738 of 55 184 patients [14.0%]) and extended (ie, 90 days; 10 737 of 30 196 patients [35.6%]) nursing home stays in the prior year. Adjusting for all other risk factors, residing in a nursing home 1 to 89 days in the prior year was associated with a higher hazard for COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] vs 0 days, 1.60; 95% CI 1.56-1.65) and for postdiagnosis mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.37), as was residing in a nursing home for an extended stay (COVID-19: HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 4.37-4.59; mortality: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16). Black race (HR vs non-Black: HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and Hispanic ethnicity (HR vs non-Hispanic: HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.64-1.72) were associated with significantly higher hazards of COVID-19. Although home dialysis was associated with lower COVID-19 rates (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80), it was associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25).

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood. METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and KruskalCWallis tests were used in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the validity and reliability of commercial wearables in measuring step count, heart rate, and energy expenditure. METHODS We identified devices to be included in the review. Database searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and SPORTDiscus, and only articles published in the English language up to May 2019 were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not identify the device used and if they did not examine the validity or reliability of the device. Studies involving the general population and all special populations were included. We operationalized validity as criterion validity (as compared with other measures) and construct validity (degree to which the device is measuring what it claims). Reliability measures focused on intradevice and interdevice reliability. RESULTS We included 158 publications examining nine different commercial wearable device brands. Fitbit was by far the most studied brand. In laboratory-based settings, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung appeared to measure steps accurately. Heart rate measurement was more variable, with Apple Watch and Garmin being the most accurate and Fitbit tending toward underestimation. For energy expenditure, no brand was accurate. We also examined validity between devices within a specific brand. CONCLUSIONS Commercial wearable devices are accurate for measuring steps and heart rate in laboratory-based settings, but this varies by the manufacturer and device type.

RESULTS: After 15 years of disease onset, 19 (36.5%), 8 (34.6%), and 19 (36.5%) subjects had impaired DL (CO), RV, and FEF(25C75), respectively. 17 (30.4%) subjects had an mMRC score  2. Fourteen (25.5%) cases had residual CT abnormalities. T regulatory cells were a bit higher in the SARS survivors. IgG antibodies against SARS S-RBD protein and N protein were detected in 11 (18.97%) and 12 (20.69%) subjects, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that small airway dysfunction and CT abnormalities were more common in the severe group than in the non-severe group (57.1% vs 22.6%, 54.5% vs 6.1%, respectively, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV could cause permanent damage to the lung, which requires early pulmonary rehabilitation.

BDNF regulates the chemosensory systems of mammals and is consistently expressed in those organs. In zebrafish, the key role of BDNF in the biology of the hair cells of the inner ear and lateral line system has recently been demonstrated. However, only some information is available about its occurrence in the olfactory epithelium, taste buds, and cutaneous isolated chemosensory cells. Therefore, this study was undertaken to analyze the involvement of BDNF in the chemosensory organs of zebrafish during the larval and adult stages. To identify cells displaying BDNF, we compared the cellular pattern of BDNF-displaying cells with those immunoreactive for calretinin and S100 protein. Our results demonstrate the localization of BDNF in the sensory part of the olfactory epithelium, mainly in the ciliated olfactory sensory neurons in larvae and adult zebrafish. Intense immunoreaction for BDNF was also observed in the chemosensory cells of oral and cutaneous taste buds. Moreover, a subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons and chemosensory cells of olfactory rosette and taste bud, respectively, showed marked immunopositivity for calcium-binding protein S100 and calretinin. These results demonstrate the possible role of BDNF in the development and maintenance of olfactory sensory neurons and sensory cells in the olfactory epithelium and taste organs of zebrafish during all stages of development.","output":"Localization of BDNF and Calretinin in Olfactory Epithelium and Taste Buds of Zebrafish (Danio rerio)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of 2019-nCoV, a new virus belonging to the coronavirus family, forced national and local governments to apply different sets of measures aimed at containing the outbreak. Los Angeles has been one of the first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March 4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving (among the others) social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis. The article specifically focuses on eight urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 16th 2020. The analyses will be updated bi-weekly to dynamically assess the short- and medium-term effects of these interventions to shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment.

METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing. RESULTS: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6 to 51.6%, which translated to the basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. With moderate community incidence (~ 30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0 = 1.5), moderate-risk (R0 = 2.9), and high-risk (R0 = 6.2) shelter were respectively 0.35, 0.13, and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27, and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42, and 0.19 for these strategies in combination. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.","output":"Comparison of infection control strategies to reduce COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters in the United States: a simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to identify educational needs and determine priorities in nursing care for home visit nurses providing services within the national long-term care insurance system in South Korea.

In this study, we applied a passive-assisted ankle motion in combination with GCS and IPCD during TKA and evaluated its effectiveness in preventing postoperative VTE. METHODS We included 77 patients who underwent primary unilateral TKA. Patients were divided into group A (53 patients who underwent GCS and IPCD on their non-surgical side limb) and group B (24 patients who underwent passive ankle dorsiflexion motion in addition to GCS and IPCD on their non-surgical side limb). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was assessed using lower extremity ultrasonography (US). The incidence of VTE in each affected limb was compared between the two groups. RESULTS US was performed 4 days after surgery on average. The incidence of DVT in groups A and B was 47.2 and 70.8 %, respectively. In group A, 22.6 % of DVTs were found only on the surgical side, 11.3 % on the non-surgical side, and 13.2 % on both sides. On the other hand, in group B, 41.7 % of DVTs were found only on the surgical side, 4.2 % on the non-surgical side, and 25.0 % on both sides. No significant difference in the incidence of VTE was noted between the 2 groups.

In this paper, we investigate whether such an assumption is correct by comparing the results achieved by two human observers with the results achieved by a Random Forest classifier (RFc) baseline model (called RFc-BL) and by three proposed automated models. The first proposed model is a Random Forest classifying descriptors of Action Unit (AU) time series; the second is a modified MobileNetV2 CNN classifying face images that combine three points in time; and the third is a custom deep network combining two CNN branches using the same input as for MobileNetV2 plus knowledge of the RFc. We conduct experiments with X-ITE phasic pain database, which comprises videotaped responses to heat and electrical pain stimuli, each of three intensities. Distinguishing these six stimulation types plus no stimulation was the main 7-class classification task for the human observers and automated approaches. Further, we conducted reduced 5-class and 3-class classification experiments, applied Multi-task learning, and a newly suggested sample weighting method. Experimental results show that the pain assessments of the human observers are significantly better than guessing and perform better than the automatic baseline approach (RFc-BL) by about 1%; however, the human performance is quite poor due to the challenge that pain that is ethically allowed to be induced in experimental studies often does not show up in facial reaction. We discovered that downweighting those samples during training improves the performance for all samples. The proposed RFc and two-CNNs models (using the proposed sample weighting) significantly outperformed the human observer by about 6% and 7%, respectively.","output":"Automatic vs. Human Recognition of Pain Intensity from Facial Expression on the X-ITE Pain Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a rapid and significant effect on human mobility because of the travel restriction to slow the spread of the infectious disease.

Prior to the pandemic, TM was associated with improvement of quality of life of older patients, low hospital admissions and nursing home placement, and high overall patients satisfaction due to convenience. However, older adults may face challenges to access TM, such as hearing, visual and cognitive decline, and limited access to Internet and devices. Ongoing vaccination campaigns and sanitary measures are keeping the pandemic under control, but new variants threaten public safety. Specific recommendations on TM use in high-risk populations, such as older adults, are therefore required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To assess the challenges of TM use in the routine primary healthcare practice of older adults. The research objective is to examine the potential effect of TM; (1) to describe the evidence of TM, (2) to understand the patients, caregivers and clinicians experiences with TM use and (3) to develop practice-based and evidence-based recommendations on effective use of TM. Multiphase design: (1) systematic mixed studies review on the evidence of TM use, (2) qualitative descriptive study on the experiences of the patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Recommendations will be proposed based on the integration of both studies.

This project extends a previous pilot couples-focused HIV intervention programme, which was shown to be feasible, acceptable and promising in reducing sexual risk behaviour among transgender women and their partners. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) tests the efficacy of this culturally sensitive HIV prevention programme for HIV-serodiscordant and HIV-negative seroconcordant transgender women and their partners. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To finalise the protocol for trial, we used qualitative methods to hone eligibility criteria, refine the intervention and control manuals, and name and brand the intervention (It Takes Two). The RCT investigates the effects of the It Takes Two intervention on Composite Risk for HIV (CR-HIV) among 100 couples. CR-HIV is a binary indicator of couple HIV risk using validated measures of sexual behaviour, pre-exposure prophylaxis use among HIV-negative participants and viral suppression among participants living with HIV. Using a two-arm RCT, we will examine intervention effects on CR-HIV at 12-month follow-up comparing transgender women and their partners randomised to the intervention versus control (HIV prevention information only).

However, the continuous evolution of SEI during charging/discharging processes complicates the fundamental understanding of its chemistry and structure. In this work, we studied the underlying mechanisms of the protection effect offered by the SEI derived from sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). In situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shows that the prior reduction of DFOB anion contributes to the SEI formation, and it suppresses the decomposition of carbonate solvents. Depth-profiling x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution solid-state NMR reveal that the DFOB anion is gradually turned into borate and fluoride-rich SEI with cycling. The protection effect of SEI reaches the optimum at 50 cycles, which triples the life span of SMB.

However, facemask can only provide enough protection if people recognize its importance and learn how to use it properly. The objective of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of patients or caregivers regarding the use of facemasks as a COVID-19 preventive measure and identifies the factors associated with its practice. Methods a cross-sectional study where 480 patients or caregivers attending the Family Medicine Clinic were systematically selected over four weeks. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on KAP regarding facemasks use. Student t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the relationship between the socio-demographic characteristics and KAP. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between knowledge, attitudes and practices. A p-value  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results about 82% of the respondents knew the correct steps of wearing a facemask, but with low positive attitudes. Further analyses showed that respondents were more likely to wear a facemask at clinics and public places than at home. There was a moderately strong correlation between knowledge and practices but weak correlations between attitude and knowledge, and attitude and practices of facemask use. Conclusion the study revealed good knowledge and practices but low attitudes towards facemask use. Therefore, public health programmes or interventions on facemask usage as a COVID-19 preventive measure, should address the attitudinal problems and also involve the family and community leaders to enhance compliance.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and practices of patients and caregivers attending a Northern Nigerian family medicine clinic regarding the use of face mask during COVID-19 pandemic: a hospital-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most widely used primary outcome measure in acute stroke trials. However, substantial interobserver variability impairs outcome assessment as well as reduces power of clinical trials. Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchical assessment tool (miFUNCTION) to address the shortcomings of the modified Rankin Scale and deliver a more thorough understanding of disability following stroke. METHODS The initial construct validity of miFUNCTION was established in a pilot study of patients at an outpatient stroke prevention clinic that had been diagnosed with stroke within 60 days. To further assess criterion validity, miFUNCTION was compared against the modified Rankin Scale and other outcome measures within the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial. Logistic regression analysis with miFUNCTION as an outcome was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment. RESULTS The pilot study showed moderate inter-observer agreement (k = 0.585, p < 0.005) but near perfect correlation between miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale ( = 0.821, p < 0.05). The correlation of miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale was near perfect again in the ESCAPE trial ( = 0.944). Effect size of the multivariable models using modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio: 3.45, 95% confidence interval: 2.05-5.78) and miFUNCTION (adjusted odds ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.99-5.55) as an outcome measure for the ESCAPE trial patients was similar. CONCLUSIONS miFUNCTION is strongly associated with the degree of disability following stroke both in an outpatient setting and a clinical trial. Further work remains to assess sensitivity to change and to improve the inter-observer reliability of the scale.","output":"Comprehensive assessment of disability post-stroke using the newly developed miFUNCTION scale."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Scarce information is available on circadian body temperature fluctuation in healthy healthcare workers.

RESULTS: A significant difference was found at different times of the day by 1-way analysis of variance (F statistics, 13.79; p < 0.001). The lowest mean forehead temperature was 36.2  0.3, recorded at 100 PM, whilst the highest was 36.7  0.3, at 900 AM. The mean difference between forehead temperature at acrophase and nadir was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.3-0.6; p < 0.001).

Unfortunately, evidence indicates that immunity wanes following vaccination, especially with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). Protection against severe disease and death remain high, but protection against milder disease and infection have dropped significantly. A third booster dose of two-dose vaccines has been approved in several countries to individuals at higher risk of severe disease to protect those individuals, but the benefit to boosting immunity in younger healthy individuals and the effects on transmission are less clear. Methods Here we use relationships between neutralizing antibody titers and vaccine protection against infection and transmission, combined with data on waning and boosting of neutralizing antibody titers to examine the impact of a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine on infection and transmission and its impact on the pathogen effective reproductive number Rt. Findings Eight months of waning reduced protection of the Pfizer vaccine against all infections from 80.0% (95% CI: 77% to 83%) to 60.4% (95% CI: 53% to 67%); a third dose (which increased neutralizing antibody titers 25.9- fold relative to levels after 8 months of waning) increased protection to 87.2% (95% CI: 83% to 91%). Increased protection against infection and transmission from third doses reduced Rt by 21% to 66% depending on vaccine coverage and previous infection and reduced Rt below 1 when vaccination coverage was high or contact rates were well below pre-pandemic levels. Interpretation A third dose of the Pfizer vaccine could reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which would reduce infection in unvaccinated individuals and breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. While vaccination of unvaccinated individuals, especially in developing countries, would be more effective for reducing disease than providing a third dose to vaccinated individuals, the benefit of a third dose in reducing transmission is sizeable and increases with vaccine coverage and contact rates among individuals.","output":"Third doses of COVID-19 vaccines reduce infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and could prevent future surges in some populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main focus of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is pulmonary complications through virus-related neurological manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, such as encephalitis, cerebral thrombosis, neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and delirium.

Amongst other anomalies, COVID-19 continues to disrupt global supply chains;thus, it remains critical to understand resilience in supply chains as a mechanism with which to respond to pandemic-related disruptions. Supply chains remain an important determinant of firm capital consumption and, as such, this study aims to examine the relationships between ambidexterity and relational capital as they relate to the resilience of U.S firms' supply chains during the contemporary market irregularities. A sample of 227 firms located in the United States were collected to analyse these convictions. PLS-SEM was utilized to test both direct and mediation results. Results suggest relational capital may have a significant role in facilitating supply chain resilience. Relational capital also acts as a strong mediator between ambidextrous innovation and resilience. Nevertheless, ambidexterity is less influential upon supply chain resilience than anticipated. This study therefore contributes towards existing supply chain resilience literature by providing a novel approach to including relational capital;something not previously considered. This paper also contributes to a greater understanding of the notions of ambidextrous innovation and relational capital amid extreme supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The effects of dynamism, relational capital, and ambidextrous innovation on the supply chain resilience of U.S. firms amid COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Physician treatment preferences for early stage, estrogen positive breast cancer (ER + BC) patients were evaluated during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US when neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) was recommended to allow safe deferral of surgery. METHODS: A validated electronic survey was administered May-June, 2020 to US medical oncologists (MO), radiation oncologists (RO), and surgeons (SO) involved in clinical trials organizations. Questions on NET use included practice patterns for locoregional management following NET. RESULTS: 114 Physicians from 29 states completed the survey-42 (37%) MO, 14 (12%) RO, and 58 (51%) SO. Before COVID-19, most used NET 'rarely' (49/107, 46%) or 'sometimes' (36, 33%) for ER + BC. 46% would delay surgery 2 months without NET. The preferred NET regimen was tamoxifen for premenopausal and aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. 53% planned short term NET until surgery could proceed. Most recommended omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for one micrometastatic node after 1, 2, or 3 months of NET (1 month, N = 56/93, 60%; 2 months, N = 54/92, 59%; 3 months, N = 48/90, 53%). With longer duration of NET, omission of ALND decreased, regardless of years in practice, percent of practice in BC, practice type, participation in multidisciplinary tumor board, or number of regional COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: More physicians preferred NET for ER + BC during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic times. As the duration of NET extended, more providers favored ALND in low volume metastatic axillary disease. The Covid-19 pandemic affected practice of ER + BC; it remains to be seen how this may impact outcomes.","output":"Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy use in early stage breast cancer during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence and spreading of COVID-19 pandemic all over the world, the uncertainty has been increasing for countries Depending on this condition, especially emerging countries have been affected negatively by foreign portfolio investment outflows from stock exchanges, and main stock exchange indices have been collapsed The study examines the causes of the main stock exchange index changes in Turkey in the COVID-19 period In this context, 14 variables (3 global, 6 country-level, 5 market-level) are analyzed by employing random forest and support vector machine algorithms and using daily data between 01 02 2020 and 05 15 2020, which includes the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods The findings prove that (i) the most important variables are the retention amount of foreign investors in the equity market, credit default swap spreads, government bonds interest rates, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) emerging markets index, and volatility index in the pre-pandemic period;(ii) the importance of variables changes as MSCI emerging markets index, the volatility index, retention amount of foreign investors in the equity market, amount of securities held by the Central Bank of Republic of Turkey (CBRT), equity market traded value in the pandemic period;(iii) support vector machine has superior estimation accuracy concerning random forest algorithms in both pre-pandemic and pandemic period","output":"The determinants of main stock exchange index changes in emerging countries: evidence from Turkey in COVID-19 pandemic age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To review obstetric personnel absences at a hospital during the initial peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection risk in New York City from March 25 to April 21, 2020.

Clinical absences for (1) Columbia University ultrasonographers, (2) inpatient nurses, (3) labor and delivery operating room (OR) technicians, (4) inpatient obstetric nurse assistants, and (5) attending physicians providing inpatient obstetric services were analyzed. Causes of absences were analyzed and classified as illness, vacation and holidays, leave, and other causes. Categorical variables were compared with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: For nurses, absences accounted for 1,052 nursing workdays in 2020 (17.2% of all workdays) compared with 670 (11.1%) workdays in 2019 (p < 0.01). Significant differentials in days absent in 2020 compared with 2019 were present for (1) postpartum nurses (21.9% compared with 12.9%, p < 0.01), (2) labor and delivery nurses (14.8% compared with 10.6%, p < 0.01), and (3) antepartum nurses (10.2% compared with 7.4%, p = 0.03).
